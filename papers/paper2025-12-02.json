    "abstract": "Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation."

    "abstract": "$α$-attractor models naturally appear in supergravity with hyperbolic geometry. The simplest versions of $α$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $α$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $α$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data."

Since existing enhancement algorithms are often too computationally intensive for vehicular applications, we propose UltraFast-LieNET, a lightweight multi-scale shifted convolutional network for real-time low-light image enhancement. We introduce a Dynamic Shifted Convolution (DSConv) kernel with only 12 learnable parameters for efficient feature extraction. By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field. To mitigate lightweight network instability, a residual structure and a novel multi-level gradient-aware loss function are incorporated. UltraFast-LieNET allows flexible parameter configuration, with a minimum size of only 36 parameters. Results on the LOLI-Street dataset show a PSNR of 26.51 dB, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.6 dB while utilizing only 180 parameters. Experiments across four benchmark datasets validate its superior balance of real-time performance and enhancement quality under limited resources.

    "abstract": "Multiple polymer networks, such as double-network elastomers comprising a sacrificial and a matrix network, exhibit exceptional mechanical resilience, commonly attributed to the formation of an extended damage zone before a crack can grow. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying their toughness remain poorly understood. Here, we combine advanced light scattering methods and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the microscopic relaxation dynamics and stress redistribution at the polymer strand scale of single-network and double-network elastomers under uni-axial loading. Dynamic light scattering experiments show that microscopic rearrangements and bond-breaking events are localized near the crack tip in single networks, readily causing the crack to advance. In contrast, double networks exhibit delocalized microscopic rearrangements well ahead of and not directly correlated with crack propagation, enabling the dissipation of energy over broader regions and timescales. Numerical simulations of the damage zone show that bond breaking in the matrix network of double networks leads to widespread stress redistribution, mitigating catastrophic damage localization. This enhanced ability to redistribute stress in a non-local manner allows a much larger extension before localized macroscopic failure occurs, explaining the superior toughness of double networks. Our findings identify early, delocalized bond-breaking events combined with more efficient dissipation pathways through enhanced microscopic rearrangements as the key microscopic mechanisms responsible for the outstanding toughness and extensibility of multiple elastomer networks."

At this putative deconfined quantum-critical point, we find a broad continuum of spinon excitations that can be accounted for by the fermionic $π$-flux state; a known mean-field model for deconfined quantum criticality. We find that the best description of the two-spinon continuum is with a version of the model with a $2\\times 2$ unit cell, reflecting non-trivial mutual statistics of spinons and anti-spinons. The single-hole spectral function can be described by the same spinon dispersion relation and an independently propagating holon. Thus, the system exhibits spin-charge separation and will likely evolve into an extended holon metal phase at finite doping."

An interplay between constraints, tinkering, and frequency-dependent selection drives the complex evolutionary trajectories of these socio-technological systems. Our approach integrates agent-based modeling and case studies, drawing on complex network analysis and evolutionary theory to explore how software evolves under the competing forces of novelty generation and imitation. By examining the evolution of programming languages and their impact on developer practices, we illustrate how technological artifacts co-evolve with and shape societal norms, cultural dynamics, and human interactions. This ecological perspective also informs our analysis of the emerging role of AI-driven development tools in software evolution. While large language models (LLMs) provide unprecedented access to information, their widespread adoption introduces new evolutionary pressures that may contribute to cultural stagnation, much like the decline of diversity in past software ecosystems. Understanding the evolutionary pressures introduced by AI-mediated software production is critical for anticipating broader patterns of cultural change, technological adaptation, and the future of software innovation."

    "abstract": "Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian photonics offer singular sensitivity enhancements but have thus far been realized almost exclusively in spatially engineered platforms with fixed geometries and limited tunability. Here we extend EP physics into the temporal domain by introducing balanced gain--loss modulation in a photonic time crystal (PTC). A time-periodic refractive-index modulation $n(t)=n_{0}+δn\\cos(Ωt)$ generates an effective non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian that supports coalescence of quasi-eigenmodes in frequency space, constituting a genuine \\textit{temporal exceptional point}. Using a reduced two-mode model for the dominant frequency sidebands, we derive a non-Hermitian dimer Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{PT}}(Δ,γ,κ)$ that is strictly $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric for $Δ=0$ and identify the exact EP condition. Numerical analysis reveals the associated Riemann-sheet topology, mode exchange and Berry-phase accumulation upon encirclement of the EP, and the characteristic $\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$ perturbation response indicative of enhanced sensing. We further construct a non-Hermitian transmission model that is exact within the reduced two-mode description, compute the Cramér--Rao bound (CRB) for temperature estimation under an explicit noise model, and show that EP-enhanced sensitivity persists when compared to a linewidth-matched Hermitian reference under identical resource constraints. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the CRB is saturable using spectral measurements. These results establish temporal non-Hermiticity as a new paradigm for dynamically reconfigurable, broadband, and geometry-independent exceptional-point photonics."

The pipeline comprises: (i) N1 CENSAL, harmonising demographics into a single person-level layer; (ii) N1b IDENTITY RESOLUTION, consolidating duplicate identifiers into a canonical ID while preserving an audit trail; and (iii) N1c GEO and SECONDARY-SCHOOL NORMALISATION, which builds reference tables, classifies school types (state national, state provincial, private secular, private religious), and flags irrecoverable cases as DATA_MISSING. The pipeline preserves 100% of students, achieves full geocoding, and yields valid school types for 56.6% of the population. The remaining 43.4% are identified as structurally missing due to legacy enrolment practices rather than stochastic non-response. Forensic analysis (chi-square, logistic regression) shows missingness is highly predictable from entry decade and geography, confirming a structural, historically induced mechanism. The article contributes: (a) a transparent, reproducible normalisation pipeline tailored to higher education; (b) a framework for treating structurally missing information without speculative imputation; and (c) guidance on defining analytically coherent cohorts (full population vs. secondary-school-informed subcohorts) for downstream learning analytics and policy evaluation."

In particular, reconfigurable integrated photonic circuits offer a promising route, thanks to the possibility of implementing adaptive feedback loops, which is an essential ingredient for achieving the necessary nonlinear behavior characteristic of neural networks. Here, we implement a quantum reservoir computing protocol in which information is processed through a reconfigurable linear optical integrated photonic circuit and measured using single-photon detectors. We exploit a multiphoton-based setup for time-series forecasting tasks in a variety of scenarios, where the input signal is encoded in one of the circuit's optical phases, thus modulating the quantum reservoir state. The resulting output probabilities are used to set the feedback phases and, at the end of the computation, are fed to a classical digital layer trained via linear regression to perform predictions. We then focus on the investigation of the role of input photon indistinguishability in the reservoir's capabilities of predicting time-series. We experimentally demonstrate that two-photon indistinguishable input states lead to significantly better performance compared to distinguishable ones. This enhancement arises from the quantum correlations present in indistinguishable states, which enable the system to approximate higher-order nonlinear functions when using comparable physical resources, highlighting the importance of quantum interference and indistinguishability as a resource in photonic quantum reservoir computing."

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the generation of synthetic participant data by prompting models to answer items while impersonating individuals of specific demographic profiles, potentially allowing in silico piloting before real data collection. Across four preregistered studies (N = circa 300 each), we tested whether LLM-simulated datasets can reproduce the latent structures and measurement properties of human responses. In Studies 1-2, we compared LLM-generated data with real datasets for two validated scales; in Studies 3-4, we created new scales using EFA on simulated data and then examined whether these structures generalized to newly collected human samples. Simulated datasets replicated the intended factor structures in three of four studies and showed consistent configural and metric invariance, with scalar invariance achieved for the two newly developed scales. However, correlation-based tests revealed substantial differences between real and synthetic datasets, and notable discrepancies appeared in score distributions and variances. Thus, while LLMs capture group-level latent structures, they do not approximate individual-level data properties. Simulated datasets also showed full internal invariance across gender. Overall, LLM-generated data appear useful for early-stage, group-level psychometric prototyping, but not as substitutes for individual-level validation. We discuss methodological limitations, risks of bias and data pollution, and ethical considerations related to in silico psychometric simulations."

    "abstract": "Imperfect molecular detection in single-cell experiments introduces technical noise that obscures the true stochastic dynamics of gene regulatory networks. While binomial models of molecular capture provide a principled description of imperfect detection, they have so far been analyzed only for simple gene-expression models that do not explicitly account for regulation. Here, we extend binomial models of capture to general gene regulatory networks to understand how imperfect capture reshapes the observed time-dependent statistics of molecular counts. Our results reveal when capture effects correspond to a renormalization of a subset of the kinetic rates and when they cannot be absorbed into effective rates, providing a systematic basis for interpreting noisy single-cell measurements. In particular, we show that rate renormalization emerges either under significant transcription factor abundance or when promoter-state transitions occur on a distinct (much slower or faster) timescale than other reactions. In these cases, technical noise causes the apparent mean burst size of synthesized gene products to appear reduced while transcription factor binding reactions appear faster. These effects hold for gene regulatory networks of arbitrary connectivity and remain valid under time-dependent kinetic rates."

These AGPs are localized inside a cavity defined by a graphene sheet and a metallic nanocube and filled with a dielectric of thickness of a few nanometers and consisting of stacked layers of 2D materials, containing impurities or defects that act as quantum light emitters. Through finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, we show that this geometry can achieve giant Purcell enhancement factors over a large portion of the infrared (IR) spectrum, up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and up to 4 orders of magnitude at telecommunications wavelengths, reaching quantum efficiencies of 95\\% and 89\\%, respectively, with high-mobility graphene. We obtain Purcell enhancement factors for single-photon electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), and electric octupole (E3) transitions and two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) transitions, of the orders of $10^{4}$, $10^{7}$, $10^{9}$, and $10^9$, respectively, and a quantum efficiency of 79\\% for entangled-photon emission with high-mobility graphene at a wavelength of $λ=1.55$ $μ$m. Importantly, AGP mode frequencies depend on the graphene Fermi energy, which can be tuned via electrostatic gating to modulate fluorescence enhancement in real time. As an example, we consider the Purcell enhancement of spontaneous single- and two-photon emissions from an erbium atom inside single-layer (SL) WS$_2$. Our results could be useful for electrically tunable quantum emitter devices with applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing."

We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy.

For a time-to-event endpoint, a statistical comparison with a reference curve can be made using the one-sample log-rank test. In order to ensure the interpretability of the results of this test, the role of the reference curve is crucial. This quantity is often estimated from a historical control group using a parametric procedure. Hence, it should be noted that it is subject to estimation uncertainty. However, this aspect is not taken into account in the one-sample log-rank test statistic. We analyse this estimation uncertainty for the common situation that the reference curve is estimated parametrically using the maximum likelihood method, and indicate how the variance estimation of the one-sample log-rank test can be adapted in order to take this variability into account.

Symbolic transitions alone are ill-suited to act on this information, and register automata have intricate formal semantics and issues with tractability. We propose a slightly different approach based on obligations, i.e., assignment-like constructs attached to transitions. Whenever a transition with an obligation is taken, the obligation is evaluated against the current symbol and yields a constraint on the next symbol that the automaton will read. We formalize obligation automata with existential and universal branching and Emerson-Lei acceptance conditions, which subsume classic families such as Büchi, Rabin, Strett, and parity automata. We show that these automata recognise a strict superset of ω-regular languages. To illustrate the practicality of our proposal, we also introduce a machine-readable format to express obligation automata and describe a tool implementing several operations over them, including automata product and emptiness checking."

To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation."

    "abstract": "Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

A negative $\\cos(2φ)$ modulation is observed for $p_T < 100$ MeV/$c$, opposite in sign to that in $ρ^{0}\\!\\to\\!π^+π^-$ photoproduction. This establishes for the first time that the interference sign is controlled by the spin structure of the final-state daughters, resolving the ambiguity present in the all-boson $ρ^0$ channel. The compact $J/ψ$ probes gluon distributions at perturbative scales, resulting in a weaker modulation and providing stringent constraints on Color Glass Condensate calculations. These findings demonstrate that spin-dependent interference in heavy vector mesons provides a new, experimentally accessible handle on gluon structure beyond traditional cross-section measurements."

We leverage an SMT formulation to traverse the time dimension first, and then perform a monomorphism-based search to find a valid spatial solution. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the same mapping quality of state-of-the-art techniques while significantly reducing compilation time, with this reduction being particularly tangible when compiling for large CGRAs.

    "abstract": "The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics provides a successful description of fundamental particles and their interactions but fails to explain phenomena such as neutrino oscillations, dark matter (DM), and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. These clear signs of BSM physics motivate extensions introducing new particles and symmetries. Theoretical questions like the flavor puzzle and the strong CP problem further guide BSM frameworks. This thesis explores BSM scenarios based on two guiding principles: constructing unified frameworks that address multiple open problems in (astro)particle physics and cosmology, and emphasizing their experimental testability through detailed phenomenological analyses. This approach uncovers deep connections between seemingly disconnected sectors, offering a more complete view of fundamental physics. We investigate dark sector models for the origin of neutrino masses, proposing a novel setup: dark linear seesaw, which radiatively links neutrino mass generation to DM candidates and predicts charged lepton flavor violation. In these scenarios, dark sector particles can constitute WIMP DM, testable via direct detection experiments. We study spontaneous CP violation induced by a complex scalar singlet, acting as a common origin of low- and high-energy CP violating effects relevant for leptogenesis. We also analyze a Nelson-Barr model that solves the strong CP problem, generates a realistic CKM matrix radiatively, and yields scalar WIMP DM. Additionally, we present unified axion frameworks in which a colored sector radiatively generates neutrino masses. These models predict distinctive axion couplings to photons and fermions and accommodate axion DM in both pre- and post-inflationary cosmologies. Finally, we explore minimal flavored Peccei-Quinn symmetries that link the flavor puzzle, neutrino masses and DM within a predictive and testable framework."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \\textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations."

The proposed construction generates random-like generator matrices that effectively conceal algebraic structure and resist known structural attacks. Security is further reinforced by the deliberate injection of strong noise during decryption, arising from polynomial division: while legitimate recipients retain polynomial-time decoding, adversaries face exponential-time complexity. As a result, the scheme achieves cryptanalytic security margins surpassing those of Classic McEliece by factors exceeding 2^(200). Beyond its enhanced security, the method offers greater design flexibility, supporting arbitrary plaintext lengths with linear-time decryption and uniform per-bit computational cost, enabling seamless scalability to long messages. Practical deployment is facilitated by parallel arrays of directed-graph decoders, which identify the correct plaintext through polynomial ambiguity while allowing efficient hardware and software implementations. Altogether, the scheme represents a compelling candidate for robust, scalable, and quantum-resistant public-key cryptography."

The available meteorological data from 1969 to 2016 is analogical, which presents a significant challenge to analyze because these records are riddled with missing values, some measurements were taken at irregular measuring intervals, making it an interesting puzzle to grasp the Antofagasta's climate scenario. To overcome this issue, we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of atmospheric temperature, pressure, and humidity time series. Our analytical approach involves the q-triplet calculation method, serving as a powerful tool to identify distinctive behavior within systems under non-equilibrium states.

    "abstract": "High Performance Computing (HPC) centers provide advanced infrastructure that enables scientific research at extreme scale. These centers operate with hardware configurations, software environments, and security requirements that differ substantially from most users' local systems. As a result, users often develop customized digital artifacts that are tightly coupled to a given HPC center. This practice can lead to significant duplication of effort as multiple users independently create similar solutions to common problems. The FAIR Principles offer a framework to address these challenges. Initially designed to improve data stewardship, the FAIR approach has since been extended to encompass software, workflows, models, and infrastructure. By encouraging the use of rich metadata and community standards, FAIR practices aim to make digital artifacts easier to share and reuse, both within and across scientific domains. Many FAIR initiatives have emerged within individual research communities, often aligned by discipline (e.g. bioinformatics, earth sciences). These communities have made progress in adopting FAIR practices, but their domain-specific nature can lead to silos that limit broader collaboration. Thus, we propose that HPC centers play a more active role in fostering FAIR ecosystems that support research across multiple disciplines. This requires designing infrastructure that enables researchers to discover, share, and reuse computational components more effectively. Here, we build on the architecture of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) EOSC-Life FAIR Workflows Collaboratory to propose a model tailored to the needs of HPC. Rather than focusing on entire workflows, we emphasize the importance of making individual workflow components FAIR. This component-based approach better supports the diverse and evolving needs of HPC users while maximizing the long-term value of their work."

A 95, 062306 (2017)] violates the quantum analogue of Arrow's impossibility theorem. We evaluate this QMR constitution analytically on classical profile data and implement its final measurement stage as a quantum circuit, running on both noiseless simulators and noisy IBM quantum hardware to map how realistic noise deforms the resulting societal ranking distribution. Moderate-high single-qubit noise does not change the qualitative behavior of QMR, whereas strong noise shifts the distribution toward other dominant winners than the classical one. We quantify this behavior using winner-agreement rates, Condorcet-winner flip rates, and Jensen-Shannon divergence between societal ranking distributions. In a second, exploratory component, we demonstrate an explicitly entanglement-based variant of the QMR constitution that serves as a testbed for multi-voter quantum correlations under noise, which we refer to as the QMR2-inspired variant. There, GHZ-type and separable superpositions over opposite rankings have the same expectation values but respond very differently to noise. Taken together, these two components connect the abstract QMR constitution to concrete implementations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and highlight design considerations for future quantum voting protocols."

However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\\% and 13\\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets."

We used tidal features, detected in deep images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey, as direct evidence of recent mergers. We find that the fraction of type 1 AGN hosts with tidal features ($f_T$) is higher for AGNs with higher luminosities and (to a lesser extent) more massive black holes. Specifically, $f_T$ rapidly increases from $0.05\\pm0.03$ to $0.75\\pm0.13$ as the luminosity of the $[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]$ $λ$5007 emission line ($L_{[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]}$), an indicator for bolometric AGN luminosity, increases in the range $10^{39.5}\\lesssim L_{[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]}/(\\mathrm{erg\\,s}^{-1}) \\lesssim10^{42.5}$. In addition, $f_T$ increases from $0.13\\pm0.03$ to $0.43\\pm0.09$ as black hole mass ($M_\\mathrm{BH}$) increases in the range $10^{6.0}\\lesssim M_\\mathrm{BH}/M_{\\odot}\\lesssim10^{8.5}$. The fraction $f_T$ also increases with the Eddington ratio, although the trend is less significant compared to that with $L_{[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]}$ and $M_\\mathrm{BH}$. The excess of $f_T$, defined as the ratio of $f_T$ for AGNs to that of their matched inactive counterparts, exhibits similar trends, primarily increasing with $L_{[\\mathrm{O\\,{\\scriptstyle III}}]}$ and weakly with $M_\\mathrm{BH}$. Our results indicate that, in the local Universe, galaxy mergers are the predominant triggering mechanism for high-luminosity AGNs, whereas they play a lesser role in triggering lower-luminosity AGNs. Additionally, strong events, such as galaxy mergers, may be more necessary to activate massive black holes in more massive galaxies due to their lower gas fractions."

Using this technique, a new design based on the proposed hyperon-nucleon spectrometer is developed. Systematic optimization confirms that the nucleon polarimeter functions effectively without impairing the detector's conventional performance. This successful integration, the first attempt of the general-purpose spectrometer, sets a valuable benchmark for future experiments. Ultimately, correlating spin polarization with four-momentum data will lead to a more profound understanding of the underlying physics."

Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages."

To ensure smooth transitions between linearization regions and suppress region-induced chattering, composite regions are introduced, merging neighboring data sets and enabling a robust switching mechanism. The proposed method maintains the original DeePC problem structure and can achieve reduced computational complexity by requiring only short, locally informative data sequences.

    "abstract": "Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/."

The stability of the equilibria is analyzed through the associated characteristic equations, and the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation near the endemic equilibrium is rigorously demonstrated.

    "abstract": "We develop a fully gauge-invariant and rigorously derived framework for computing the cumulative decoherence of gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through a stochastic quantum spacetime. Working directly with the Riemann-tensor two-point function and exploiting the extreme adiabaticity of cosmological GW propagation, we show that phase diffusion, rather than amplitude attenuation or mode mixing, is the unique leading-order imprint of microscopic curvature fluctuations. Our main theoretical result is a universality theorem: for any quantum-gravity model whose curvature fluctuations possess a finite correlation length, the accumulated phase variance grows linearly with distance, independent of the underlying microphysics. This diffusive scaling contrasts sharply with coherent astrophysical effects and with nonlocal models. The frequency exponent therefore becomes a clean spectral discriminator, separating string-foam recoil, holographic or scale-invariant noise, and causal-set discreteness. We obtain these results from first principles by evaluating the projected Riemann correlator along null geodesics and determining the exact conditions under which deviations from universality can arise. Finally, we outline a hierarchical Bayesian strategy for measuring this effect with LIGO, LISA, and Pulsar Timing Arrays. Although standard Planck-scale fluctuations remain far below current sensitivity, this framework provides a sharp and falsifiable test of exotic quantum-spacetime scenarios, particularly those with macroscopic correlation lengths or strong energy dependence."

A language $L$ is in $\\text{Q}\\mathbb{R}$, if there is a polynomial time reduction from $L$ to FOTR. This seems the first time this complexity class is studied. We show that $\\text{Q}\\mathbb{R}$ can also be defined using real Turing machines. It is known that deciding FOTR requires at least exponential time unconditionally [Berman, 1980]. We focus on devil's games with two defining properties: (1) Players (human and devil) alternate turns and (2) each turn has a continuum of options. First, we show that FOTRINV is $\\text{Q}\\mathbb{R}$-complete. FOTRINV has only inversion and addition constraints and all variables are in a compact interval. FOTRINV is a stepping stone for further reductions. Second, we show that the Packing Game is $\\text{Q}\\mathbb{R}$-complete. In the Packing Game we are given a container and two sets of pieces. One set of pieces for the human and one set for the devil. The human and the devil alternate by placing a piece into the container. Both rotations and translations are allowed. The first player that cannot place a piece loses. Third, we show that the Planar Extension Game is $\\text{Q}\\mathbb{R}$-complete. We are given a partially drawn plane graph and the human and the devil alternate by placing vertices and the corresponding edges in a straight-line manner. The vertices and edges to be placed are prescribed before hand. The first player that cannot place a vertex loses. Finally, we show that the Order Type Game is $\\text{Q}\\mathbb{R}$-complete. We are given an order-type together with a linear order. The human and the devil alternate in placing a point in the Euclidean plane following the linear order.

    "abstract": "Dirac semimetals, with their protected Dirac points, present an ideal platform for realizing intrinsic topological superconductivity. In this work, we investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional, square-lattice nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal. In the normal state near half-filling, the Fermi surface consists of two distinct pockets, each enclosing a Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum ($\\textbf{X}=(π,0)$ and $\\textbf{Y}=(0,π)$). Considering an on-site repulsive and nearest-neighbor attractive interaction, we use self-consistent mean-field theory to determine the ground-state pairing symmetry. We find that an even-parity, spin-singlet $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing is favored as it gives rise to a fully gapped superconducting state. Since the pairing amplitude has opposite signs on the two Dirac Fermi pockets, the superconducting state is identified as a second-order topological superconductor. The hallmark of this topological phase is the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the system's boundaries. Notably, the positions of these Majorana modes are highly controllable and can be manipulated simply by tailoring the boundary sublattice terminations. Our results highlight the promise of nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals for realizing and manipulating Majorana modes."

The singular control is equivalently characterized as a pair of regions of time and the augmented states, called the singular control law. To encourage the exploration in the learning procedure, we propose a randomization method for the singular control laws, new to the literature, by considering an auxiliary singular control and entropy regularization. The exploratory singular control problem is formulated as a two-stage optimal control problem, where the time-inconsistency issue arises in the outer problem. In the specific model setup with known model coefficients, we provide the full characterization of the time-consistent equilibrium singular controls for the two-stage problem. Taking advantage of the solution structure, we can consider the proper parameterization of the randomized equilibrium policy and the value function when the model is unknown and further devise the actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms. In the numerical experiment, we present the superior convergence of parameter iterations towards the true values based on the randomized equilibrium policy and illustrate how the exploration may advance the learning performance in the context of singular controls."

Here, we investigate the effects of increasing pressure up to $0.4$ GPa on hydrated lysozyme proteins, by measuring the nanoscale stress relaxation induced and probed by X-rays. Structural and dynamical information at elevated pressures was obtained using X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) in combination with a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The dynamical analysis revealed a slowing down of the system up to $0.2$ GPa, followed by a re-acceleration at $0.4$ GPa. A similar non-monotonic behavior was observed both in the Porod and Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) exponents, consistently indicating a crossover between $0.2$ and $0.4$ GPa. These findings suggest the presence of pressure-induced structural changes that impact protein collective stress-relaxation as the system transitions from a jammed state to an elastically driven regime. These results may be relevant for a deeper understanding of protein stability under compression as well as for practical high-pressure technologies, including food processing and pharmaceutical applications."

In nickelates, understanding the role of lattice is essential to unravel the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin degree of freedom in giving rise to various emergent phenomena reported recently. Here, we investigate the phononic DoF in a series of trilayer nickelates, namely Pr4-xLaxNi3O10 (where x = 0, 0.4, 1, 2, 3.6, and 4) using temperature and polarization dependent Raman scattering measurements. Our in-depth analysis of the phonon evolution with temperature and doping, gives interesting insights into the behaviour of these materials. All these systems undergo a metal-to-metal transition (TMMT), characterized by the development of intertwined spin and charge density waves, with the spin density wave preceding the charge density wave. These transitions manifest as pronounced anomalies in phonon self-energy parameters i.e. peak frequency and linewidth in the vicinity of the metal-to-metal transition. Several phonon modes show dramatic change (nearly an order of magnitude for some modes) in their softening rates across the TMMT, highlighting the sensitivity of the lattice dynamics to spin and charge order. These findings emphasize the crucial role of lattice DoF in mediating correlated ground states in layered nickelates."

    "abstract": "Flying focus laser pulse technology, characterized by programmable velocity profiles and the ability to break the traditional link between focal spot motion and group velocity constraints, holds significant potential for revolutionary advances in high-intensity laser related fields. However,the flying focus generated with conventional approaches suffers from a low maximum intensity, as the energy is spread over a long distance, and the size of the focusing optics is also limited. Here, we propose a zone-plate-based flying focus scheme in which the zone widths are modulated by a sinusoidal random distribution. Numerical simulations show that the high-order foci produced by the modulated zone plate can be suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the scheme sustains a high-intensity focal region extending over more than 100 Rayleigh lengths. Furthermore, the focal speed can be tuned over a wide range, including values exceeding the speed of light in vacuum. Owing to these advantages, the proposed modulated zone-plate scheme offers new possibilities for high-intensity laser physics and holds promise for applications such as laser wakefield acceleration, photon acceleration, and more."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning."

However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \\textbf{D}ual-\\textbf{RO}bust \\textbf{C}ross-domain \\textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations."

The measured three-body loss coefficient $L_3$ is well captured by a thermally averaged cascade-recombination model, enabling extraction of the resonance splitting $δB$ and effective-range parameter $k_e$.

    "abstract": "Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks."

We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available."

In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer."

    "abstract": "Existing theoretical analyses of satellite mega-constellations often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as short serving times, or lack tractability when evaluating realistic handover strategies. Motivated by these limitations, this paper develops a general analytical framework for accurately characterising the ergodic capacity of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks under arbitrary handover strategies. Specifically, we model the transmission link as shadowed-Rician fading and introduce the persistent satellite channel, wherein the channel process is governed by an i.i.d. renewal process under mild assumptions of uncoordinated handover decisions and knowledge of satellite ephemeris and fading parameters. Within this framework, we derive the ergodic capacity (persistent capacity) of the persistent satellite channel using renewal theory and establish its relation to the non-persistent capacity studied in prior work. To address computational challenges, we present closed-form upper and lower bounds on persistent capacity. The optimal handover problem is formulated as a non-linear fractional program, obtaining an explicit decision rule via a variant of Dinkelbach's algorithm. We further demonstrate that a simpler handover strategy maximising serving capacity closely approximates the optimal strategy, providing practical insights for designing high-throughput LEO satellite communication systems."

For static fields, this problem can be mitigated through the use of a superconducting holding field coil, which when operated in persistent current mode serves to stabilize the magnetic field. However, such a solution is not viable when time-varying magnetic fields are present, as is the case for the spin dressing mode of the proposed nEDMSF (nEDM super-fluid) experiment. This experiment features an oscillating magnetic field to dress the gyromagnetic ratios of $^3$He and neutrons to the same value, a condition known as critical dressing. Fluctuations in the dressing field amplitude have the potential to disrupt this condition. Here, we investigate a modification to spin dressing, termed ``magic dressing,'' which renders the system insensitive to small variations in dressing field amplitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this method for the single spin-species case using a sample of polarized $^3$He. We find a dramatic increase in transverse relaxation time in the presence of magnetic field gradients."

In this paper, we present a deep learning-based interactive continual learning framework for singing voice separation that allows users to fine-tune the vocal separation model to conform it to new target songs. We use a U-Net-based base model architecture that produces a mask for separating vocals from the spectrogram, followed by a human-in-the-loop task where the user provides feedback by marking a few false positives, i.e., regions in the extracted vocals that should have been silence. We propose two continual learning algorithms.

    "abstract": "Posted-price mechanisms (PPMs) are a widely adopted strategy for online resource allocation due to their simplicity, intuitive nature, and incentive compatibility. To manage the uncertainty inherent in online settings, PPMs commonly employ dynamically increasing prices. While this adaptive pricing achieves strong performance, it introduces practical challenges: dynamically changing prices can lead to fairness concerns stemming from price discrimination and incur operational costs associated with frequent updates. This paper addresses these issues by investigating posted pricing constrained by a limited, pre-specified number of allowed price changes, denoted by $Δ$. We further extend this framework by incorporating a second critical dimension: risk sensitivity. Instead of evaluating performance based solely on expectation, we utilize a tail-risk objective-specifically, the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of the total social welfare, parameterized by a risk level $δ\\in [0, 1]$. We formally introduce a novel problem class kSelection-$(δ,Δ)$ in online adversarial selection and propose a correlated PPM that utilizes a single random seed to correlate posted prices. This correlation scheme is designed to address both the limited price changes and simultaneously enhance the tail performance of the online algorithm. Our subsequent analysis provides performance guarantees under these joint constraints, revealing a clear trade-off between the number of allowed price changes and the algorithm's risk sensitivity. We also establish optimality results for several important special cases of the problem."

To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models.

    "abstract": "With the advancement of natural language generation (NLG) technologies, creative story generation systems have gained increasing attention. However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

The schemes considered in this paper are based on the semi-Lagrangian technique combined with spatial discretization by higher-order interpolation operators. For the semi-Lagrangian schemes equipped with the spline or Hermite interpolation operators of order $ 2 s - 1 $, we derive an $L^2$-error estimate of $ O (Δt^r + h^{2s} / Δt) $ and an $ H^s $-error estimate of $ O (Δt^r + h^{s} / \\sqrt{Δt}) $, where $ h $ and $ Δt $ denote the spatial mesh size and the time step size, respectively, and $ r \\in \\lparen 0, 1\\rbrack $ is a parameter determined by the discretization of the dispersive term. A key step in the analysis is to establish the stability of the interpolation operators. Under suitable assumptions, interpolation operators of order $ 2s - 1 $ are stable with respect to the $ H^s $-norm as well as a weighted $ H^s $-norm. The weighted $H^s$-norm depends on $h$ and $Δt$, and it reduces to the $L^2$-norm in the limit $ h \\to 0 $."

    "abstract": "The electrification of off-road heavy equipment presents operational challenges for agencies serving remote sites with limited fixed charging infrastructure. Existing mobile fast charging vehicle (MFCV) planning approaches typically treat fleet design and routing as separate problems, fixing vehicle characteristics before dispatch. This paper formulates a fleet size and mix capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (FSMCVRPTW) for MFCV deployment, jointly optimizing fleet composition, charger specifications, routing, and scheduling within a unified mixed-integer linear program. The model incorporates heterogeneous MFCV types with varying power ratings, battery capacities, fuel range, and cost structures, minimizing total daily cost from labor, fuel, amortized capital expenditure, and energy purchase under temporal service windows, resource budgets, and energy-delivery constraints. The formulation is implemented in Python/Gurobi and applied to two case studies using California Department of Transportation wheel-loader data in Los Angeles (dense urban) and Truckee (sparse mountainous). Results show that simultaneous optimization yields compact, well-utilized fleets that meet all service windows while revealing strong sensitivity of unit cost to demand density and geography. The proposed FSMCVRPTW framework provides a generalizable decision-support methodology that co-designs fleet size, charger power, routing, and service schedules in a single optimization layer for context-aware, cost-efficient mobile fast charging."

    "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is widely applied for forest monitoring, since the sensor nodes (SNs) in IoT network are low-cost and have computing ability to process the monitoring data. To further improve the performance of forest monitoring, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed as the data processors to enhance computing capability. However, efficient forest monitoring with limited energy budget and computing resource presents a significant challenge. For this purpose, this paper formulates a multi-objective optimization framework to simultaneously consider three optimization objectives, which are minimizing the maximum computing delay, minimizing the total motion energy consumption, and minimizing the maximum computing resource, corresponding to efficient forest monitoring, energy consumption reduction, and computing resource control, respectively. Due to the hybrid solution space that consists of continuous and discrete solutions, we propose a diffusion model-enhanced improved multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) to solve the formulated framework. The simulation results show that the proposed IMOGWO outperforms other benchmarks for solving the formulated framework. Specifically, for a small-scale network with $6$ UAVs and $50$ SNs, compared to the suboptimal benchmark, IMOGWO reduces the motion energy consumption and the computing resource by $53.32\\%$ and $9.83\\%$, respectively, while maintaining computing delay at the same level. Similarly, for a large-scale network with $8$ UAVs and $100$ SNs, IMOGWO achieves reductions of $41.81\\%$ in motion energy consumption and $7.93\\%$ in computing resource, with the computing delay also remaining comparable."

In large-scale scenarios such as search and rescue or environmental monitoring, traditional uniform coverage fails to account for varying regional priorities. DPC leverages a pre-constructed reference distribution to allocate agents' coverage efforts, spending more time in high-priority or densely sampled regions. We analyze convergence conditions using the Wasserstein distance, derive an analytic optimal control law for unconstrained cases, and propose a numerical method for constrained scenarios. Simulations on first-order dynamics and linearized quadrotor models demonstrate that DPC achieves trajectories closely matching the non-uniform reference distribution, outperforming existing coverage methods."

    "abstract": "Roughgarden (2020) initiates the study of Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs), and posits that the on-chain game of a ``good'' TFM should be on-chain simple (OnCS), i.e., incentive compatible for users and the miner. Recent work of Ganesh, Thomas and Weinberg (2024) posits that they should additionally be Off-Chain Influence Proof (OffCIP), which means that the miner cannot achieve any additional revenue by separately conducting an off-chain auction to determine on-chain inclusion. They observe that a cryptographic second-price auction satisfies both properties, but leave open the question of whether other mechanisms (e.g, non-cryptographic) satisfy these properties. In this paper, we characterize OffCIP TFMs: They are those satisfying a burn identity relating the burn rule to the allocation rule. In particular, we show that auction is OffCIP if and only if its (induced direct-revelation) allocation rule $\\bar{X}(\\cdot)$ and burn rule $\\bar{B}(\\cdot)$ (both of which take as input users' values $v_1, \\dots, v_n$) are truthful when viewing $\\big(\\bar{X}(\\cdot), \\bar{B}(\\cdot)\\big)$ as the allocation and pricing rule of a multi-item auction for a single additive buyer with values $\\big(\\varphi(v_1),\\ldots, \\varphi(v_n)\\big)$ equal to the users' virtual values. Building on this burn identity, we characterize deterministic OffCIP and OnCS TFMs that do not use cryptography: They are posted-price mechanisms with specially-tuned burns. As a corollary, we show that such TFMs can only exist with infinite supply and prior-dependence. However, we show that for randomized TFMs, there are additional OnCS and OffCIP auctions that do not use cryptography (even when there is finite supply, under prior-dependence with a bounded prior distribution). Holistically, our results show that while OffCIP is a fairly stringent requirement, families of OffCIP mechanisms can be found for a variety of settings."

    "abstract": "Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been proposed to meet the demand for reliable communication in high-mobility scenarios for future wireless networks. However, in multi-user OTFS systems, conventional embedded pilot schemes require independent pilot allocation for each user, leading to linearly increasing pilot overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we investigate the uplink channel estimation and pilot design for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS systems. We propose a multi-dimensional decomposition-based channel estimation algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first estimates the angles of arrivals (AoAs) via subspace decomposition-based method. A spatial projection matrix, constructed from the estimated AOAs, decouples the received signal by propagation path subspace, effectively mitigating inter-path interference. The remaining fractional delay and Doppler can be obtained by a compressed sensing (CS)-based off-grid channel estimation method. Furthermore, to reduce the pilot overhead in multi-user OTFS systems, this paper proposes a novel cyclic shift embedded pilot (CSEP) structure, which can reuse users through cyclic shift-orthogonality of Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. Compared with conventional embedded pilot structures, the CSEP structure can save over 30\\% of pilot overhead. Finally, an imporved channel estimation method based on the CSEP structure is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that it achieves superior performance in channel estimation. Moreover, the proposed CSEP structure and channel estimation algorithm achieve a favorable balance between computational complexity, estimation accuracy, and bit error rate (BER) performance."

    "abstract": "Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit."

    "abstract": "Community detection in multilayer networks (CDMN) is to divide a set of entities with multiple relation types into a few disjoint subsets, which has many applications in the Web, transportation, and sociology systems. Recent neural network-based solutions to the CDMN task adopt a kind of representation fusion and global division paradigm: Each node is first learned a kind of layer-wise representations which are then fused for global community division. However, even with contrastive or attentive fusion mechanisms, the fused global representations often lack the discriminative power to capture structural nuances unique to each layer. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for the CDMN task: Layered Division and Global Allocation (LDGA). The core idea is to first perform layer-wise group division, based on which global community allocation is next performed. Concretely, LDGA employs a multi-head Transformer as the backbone representation encoder, where each head is for encoding node structural characteristics in each network layer. We integrate the Transformer with a community-latent encoder to capture community prototypes in each layer. A shared scorer performs layered division by generating layer-wise soft assignments, while global allocation assigns each node the community label with highest confidence across all layers to form the final consensus partition. We design a loss function that couples differentiable multilayer modularity with a cluster balance regularizer to train our model in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world multilayer networks demonstrate that our LDGA outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in terms of higher detected community modularities.

We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift."

More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs."

    "abstract": "Fox's conjecture (1962) states that the sequence of absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of alternating links is trapezoidal. While the conjecture remains open in general, a number of special cases have been settled, some, quite recently: Fox's conjecture was shown to hold for special alternating links by Hafner, Mészáros, and Vidinas (2023) and for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links by Azarpendar, Juhász, and Kálmán (2024). Any alternating link can be written as a diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links; thus, if one could remove the certain adjective in the previous result, it would settle Fox's conjecture. In this paper, we give an alternative proof of Azarpendar, Juhász, and Kálmán's aforementioned result via a dimer model for the Alexander polynomial. In doing so, we not only obtain a significantly shorter proof of Azarpendar, Juhász, and Kálmán's result than the original, but we also obtain several theorems of independent interest regarding the Alexander polynomial, which are readily visible from the dimer point of view. Moreover, we explain, backed with computational evidence, why our result is only for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links as opposed to all. While the latter does not settle an open question, it strikes us as important to bring to attention, given the interest in finding a solution to Fox's conjecture."

In the theory, local bosons(LBs) are introduced as carriers for the transport. The LBs are stimulated by individual atoms in the lattice, which are different from the phonons that are collective motions of the atoms. The LBs move in the FPU chain and are governed by a set of stochastic differential equations(SDEs). The anharmonic interaction between the atoms in the lattice is transformed to a random field by the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, and has been implemented in the set of SDEs. By solving the set of SDEs at the steady state, we study the influence of the anharmonic interaction on the thermal transport. Results show that the anharmonic interaction decreases the thermal current by trapping the LBs on the lattice sites, as well as increase the thermal current by enhancing the amount of the LBs for the transport. The competition between these two mechanisms makes the thermal conductivity of the lattice dependent on the anharmonic interaction non-monotonically. The finite size effect of the thermal conductivity has also been captured by the theory."

Our implementation using various quantum models (VQC, QCNN, and SamplerQNN) reveals minimal performance overhead despite the added security measures. This work establishes a crucial foundation for quantum-resistant autonomous vehicle systems that can operate securely in the post-quantum era while efficiently processing the massive data volumes (20-40TB/day per vehicle) generated by modern autonomous fleets.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \\textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\\% to 51.8\\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike)."

    "abstract": "One year ago, we open-sourced DocETL, a declarative system for LLM-powered data processing that, as of November 2025, has 3.2K GitHub stars and users across domains (e.g., journalism, law, medicine, policy, finance, and urban planning). In DocETL, users build pipelines by composing operators described in natural language, also known as semantic operators, with an LLM executing each operator's logic. However, due to complexity in the operator or the data it operates on, LLMs often give inaccurate results. To address this challenge, DocETL introduced rewrite directives, or abstract rules that guide LLM agents in rewriting pipelines by decomposing operators or data. For example, decomposing a single filter(\"is this email sent from an executive and discussing fraud?\") into the conjunction of two separate semantic filters may improve accuracy. However, DocETL only optimizes for accuracy, not cost. How do we optimize for both? We present MOAR (Multi-Objective Agentic Rewrites), a new optimizer for DocETL. To target cost optimization, we introduce two new categories of directives and extend all three existing categories with new ones, bringing the total to over 30 directives -- more than doubling what DocETL originally had. Moreover, since operators can interact with each other unpredictably due to LLM behavior, optimizing operators or sub-pipelines individually can yield suboptimal overall plans. Recognizing this, we design a new global search algorithm that explores rewrites in the context of entire pipelines. Since the space of rewrites is infinite -- pipelines can be rewritten in many ways, and each rewritten pipeline can itself be rewritten -- our algorithm adapts a multi-armed bandit framework to prioritize which pipelines to rewrite. Across six workloads, MOAR achieves 27% higher accuracy than ABACUS, the next-best optimizer, while matching its best accuracy at 55% of its cost."

    "abstract": "When the gauge group of a theory has infinite volume, defining the inner product on physical states becomes subtle. This is the case for gravity, even in exactly solvable models such as minisuperspace or low-dimensional theories: the physical states do not inherit an inner product in a straightforward manner, and different quantization procedures yield a priori inequivalent prescriptions. This is one of the main challenges when constructing gravitational Hilbert spaces. In this paper we study a quantization procedure known as group averaging, which is a special case of the BRST/BV formalism and has gained popularity as a promising connection between Dirac quantization and gravitational path integrals. We identify a large class of theories for which group averaging is ill-defined due to isometry groups with infinite volume, which includes Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. We propose a modification of group averaging to renormalize these infinite volumes and use it to quantize Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with a positive cosmological constant in closed universes. The resulting Hilbert space naturally splits into infinite-dimensional superselection sectors and has a positive-definite inner product. This is the first complete Dirac quantization of this theory, as we are able to capture all the physical states for the first time."

A graph $G$ is said to be a bounded extension of its subgraph $L$ if they share the same vertex set, and the graph distance $d_L(u, v)$ is uniformly bounded for edges $uv\\in G$. Given vertices $u, v$ in $G$ and an integer $k$, the geodesic slice $S(u, v, k)$ denotes the subset of vertices $w$ lying on a geodesic in $G$ between $u$ and $v$ with $d_G(u, w) = k$. We say that $G$ has bounded geodesic slices if $|S(u, v, k)|$ is uniformly bounded over all $u, v, k$. We call a graph $L$ geodesically directable if it has a bounded extension $G$ with bounded geodesic slices. Contrary to previous expectations, we prove that $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is geodesically directable. Physically, this provides a setting in which one could devise exactly-solvable chaotic local quantum circuits with non-trivial correlation patterns on 2D Euclidean lattices. In fact, we show that any bounded extension of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is geodesically directable. This further implies that all two-dimensional regular tilings are geodesically directable."

    "abstract": "Data-driven motion priors that can guide agents toward producing naturalistic behaviors play a pivotal role in creating life-like virtual characters. Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters. Video demo available at https://youtu.be/ravlZJteS20"

Robustly estimating the dominant signal in practice has been a fundamental statistical problem. Classically, mixture models have been used to cluster the heterogeneous population into homogeneous components. Modeling such data with fully parametric models risks bias under misspecification, while fully nonparametric approaches can dissipate power and computational resources. We propose a middle path: a semiparametric method that models only the dominant component parametrically and leaves the background completely nonparametric, yet remains computationally scalable and statistically robust. So instead of outlier downweighting, traditionally done in robust statistics literature, we maximize the observed likelihood such that the noisy background is absorbed by the nonparametric component. Computationally, we propose a new approximate FFT-accelerated likelihood maximization algorithm. Empirically, this FFT plug-in achieves order-of-magnitude speedups over vanilla weighted EM while preserving statistical accuracy and large sample properties."

We study inference-time compute (ITC) for evaluators that generate n independent thinking-rating samples per item, and propose a principled, distribution-calibrated aggregation scheme. Our method models three-way preferences with a Bradley-Terry-Davidson formulation on rating counts, leveraging both polarity (margin among non-ties) and decisiveness (non-tie rate) to distinguish narrow margins from strong consensus. Across various evaluation benchmarks, our approach consistently reduces MAE and increases pairwise accuracy versus standard baselines, and when evaluated against human-consensus meta-labels, matches or exceeds individual human raters. These results show that carefully allocating ITC and aggregating with distribution-aware methods turns noisy individual model judgments into reliable ratings for evaluation."

The electromagnetic transitions are calculated from the ground and $P$-wave states to ground states, as well as from the second shell states to both the ground and $P$-wave final states. These decays play a crucial role in confirming the existence of certain resonances when strong decays are not allowed. %A relevant case is the $Ω_c^{0}$ spin excitation with $\\bf J^P ={\\frac{3}{2}}^{+}$ denoted as $Ω_c^{*0}$. This state cannot decay strongly, but has a nonvanishing predicted electromagnetic decay width in the $Ω_c^{0} γ$ channel. The $Ω_c^{*0}$ was precisely observed in this channel. Moreover, electromagnetic decay widths are particularly useful for identifying resonances when states have the same mass and total decay width. A relevant case is the $Ω_c (3327)$ state, whose branching ratios between the strong decay channels are comparable; thus, the radiative decay widths may help assign this state. We also make the assignment of the recently discovered $Ξ'_c(2923)^{+}$ baryon, which is consistent with being the isospin partner of the $Ξ'_c(2923)^{0}$. This study presents, for the first time, the calculation of electromagnetic decays for $D_ρ$-wave states, $ρ-λ$ mixed states, and $ρ$-mode radially excited states in the charm sector. Throughout our calculations, we account for uncertainties arising from both experimental and model-dependent errors."

We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \\textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed. Trained and evaluated on large-scale driving benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse2), our method outperforms prior work both when trained on each dataset and in zero-shot transfer across datasets, and it scales well as the number of input frames increases."

IOTA is a compact, fixed-energy storage ring dedicated to beam physics Research and Development and capable of circulating a 2.5 MeV proton beam under extreme space-charge conditions. Using the ImpactX code with its 3D space-charge solver, simulations indicate that the bunch length can be rapidly reduced by at least a factor of two without appreciable degradation of transverse beam quality--even in the strong space-charge regime. However, longitudinal defocusing due to the space-charge remains a significant challenge in short-pulsed intense proton bunches, and the optimization of compression under these conditions is discussed."

However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods."

The method fuses GNSS and IMU data using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) on a manifold, enabling continuous attitude tracking. The proposed approach utilizes attitude information from satellite combinations to identify and exclude multipath-affected satellites, improving the accuracy of both positioning and attitude determination. To address computational challenges associated with evaluating large numbers of satellite combinations, we propose the use of the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which reduces the number of combinations assessed while maintaining high detection performance. Performance evaluations are conducted using trajectories and IMU readings from the KITTI dataset. GNSS observations are simulated based on ground truth positions and satellite ephemeris. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting satellites affected by multipath interference. Significant improvements in positioning accuracy are observed, particularly in scenarios where a large portion of the visible satellites are contaminated by severe multipath."

We find that the skyrmion displacement is proportional to the field gradient, while the time it takes to reach their final position is almost independent of it. Below a critical magnetic field gradient strength, the system displays an unusual 'remembering' dynamics: when the magnetic field gradient is removed, the skyrmions return to their original positions to a high degree of accuracy. We explain this observation and other quantitative features using a moduli space dynamics approximation. We further provide an exact treatment of the dynamics that indicates that deviations from exact memory of the skyrmion position can arise."

We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment. In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images."

The required two-point equilibrium correlation functions are evaluated using the Matsubara formalism of thermal field theory, applying a 1/Nc expansion to the relevant multi-loop Feynman diagrams. We employ previously derived quark spectral functions obtained from one--meson-exchange diagrams above the Mott transition temperature. Our numerical results show that both thermoelectric coefficients increase approximately linearly with temperature and decrease with increasing chemical potential. We also estimate the magnitude of the electric fields that can be generated in heavy-ion collisions by thermal gradients via the Seebeck effect."

This Perspective provides a cross-domain comparison between the brain and AI that goes beyond the traditional focus on visual processing, adopting the emerging perspecive of world-model-based computation. Here, we identify shared computational mechanisms in the attention-based neocortex and the non-attentional cerebellum: both predict future world events from past inputs and construct internal world models through prediction-error learning. These predictive world models are repurposed for seemingly distinct functions -- understanding in sensory processing and generation in motor processing -- enabling the brain to achieve multi-domain capabilities and human-like adaptive intelligence. Notably, attention-based AI has independently converged on a similar learning paradigm and world-model-based computation. We conclude that these shared mechanisms in both biological and artificial systems constitute a core computational foundation for realizing diverse functions including high-level intelligence, despite their relatively uniform circuit structures.

However, experimentally validated models for MC in VNs remain scarce. To address this gap, we propose a novel channel model for MC in complex VN topologies, which captures molecular transport via advection, molecular and turbulent diffusion, as well as adsorption and desorption at the vessel walls. We specialize this model for superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules by introducing a new receiver (RX) model for planar coil inductive sensors, enabling end-to-end experimental validation with a dedicated SPION testbed. Validation covers a range of channel topologies, from single-vessel topologies to branched VNs with multiple paths between transmitter (TX) and RX. Additionally, to quantify how the VN topology impacts signal quality, and inspired by multi-path propagation models in conventional wireless communications, we introduce two metrics, namely molecule delay and multi-path spread. We show that these metrics link the VN structure to molecule dispersion induced by the VN and mediately to the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the RX. The proposed VN structure-SNR link is validated experimentally, demonstrating that the proposed framework can support tasks such as optimal sensor placement in the CVS or the identification of suitable testbed topologies for specific SNR requirements. All experimental data are openly available on Zenodo."

The combination of EUV and X-ray images and X-ray spectra allowed us to identify hot loops in the vicinity of the filament before its eruption. We interpreted their interaction with the rising filament as a signature of an arcade-to-rope reconnection geometry. The subsequent EUV brightening within the filament revealed helical structure of the erupting rope. We explained co-temporal radio slowly positively drifting bursts as a result of beam acceleration within the magnetic rope and propagation along the helical structure. Corresponding X-ray spectra were consistent with a thermal origin. The filament rising was accompanied by co-temporal normal and reverse drift type III radio bursts. We interpreted them as a signature of a reconnection event and estimated electron density at the reconnection site. Further untwisting of the helical structure led to formation of a quasi-circular EUV structure seen from Earth and STEREO-A. Its occurrence was co-temporal with a unique tangle of radio U- and inverse U-bursts. We proposed that several accelerated beams propagate within that complex structure and generate the burst tangle. During the start of the flare hard X-ray emission was concentrated near the filament leg only suggesting predominant propagation of the beams towards its rooting. We collected multi-wavelength observations indicating interaction of the erupting magnetic flux rope with the overlying arcade and internal magnetic reconnection inside the rising flux rope."

Two detector variants with different geometries and materials were investigated using a picosecond pulsed laser system. We measured the single-photon timing response and spatial charge distribution on segmented readout electrodes. The prompt timing peak exhibits a resolution of approximately 30 ps, with the overall timing structure explained by photoelectron propagation and back-scattering effects from the MCP input surface. We developed analytical models that describe the propagation of photoelectrons and the induced charge spread on the sensing electrodes, including secondary electron backscattering from the resistive anode. The model accurately reproduces the measured device properties and enables performance extrapolations for various detector geometries and dielectric properties. These results provide a predictive framework for optimizing MCP-PMTs for timing- and imaging-critical applications such as RICH detectors in high-energy physics and TOF-PET systems for medical imaging."

Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\\% and 91.07\\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs."

We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions."

To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities."

While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow. The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough. We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems."

    "abstract": "Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance."

General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting."

To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above).

Biological systems achieve autonomous behavior by utilizing chemical energy from out-of-equilibrium reactions to power life-like functions without requiring external energy inputs. Although responsive hydrogels with embedded enzymatic reactions offer a promising platform for implementing adaptive behavior in synthetic systems, previous studies have focused on controlling the supramolecular self-assembly of responsive building blocks rather than modulating network crosslinking. Here, we demonstrate direct enzymatic modulation of crosslinking density in a double-network hydrogel to achieve autonomous self-stiffening in response to a chemical stimulus. Our adaptive system embeds glucose oxidase within a polyacrylamide-alginate double-network hydrogel containing Ca(EDTA)2- complexes that render the crosslinked alginate network pH-responsive through a competitive calcium binding mechanism. Chemical waves emerging from enzymatic reaction activation propagate at speeds ranging from 15 to 44 um/min, driving spatiotemporal mechanical transitions that increase material stiffness by up to 2.1-fold. By integrating signal sensing and chemomechanical transduction within this responsive hydrogel, we realized adaptive behavior that autonomously converts localized chemical inputs into system-wide mechanical outputs. This positions our adaptive hydrogels as promising model systems to guide the design of intelligent materials for soft robotics and biomedical devices."

Specifically, we used the Double Helix PSF (DH-PSF) in which a single fluorescent source gives rise to two lobes in the image plane with the lobes rotating in the plane as the particle moves along the optical axis. We designed simple estimators of the relative error between the particle and the tracker, and a simple proportional feedback controller to regulate that error to zero.

However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF.

However, this approach is not scalable, as it places a heavy load on the sender. This work presents an autonomic algorithm that enables the $n$ processes in a distributed system to build and maintain a spanning tree connecting themselves. In this context, processes are the vertices of the spanning tree. By definition, a spanning tree connects all processes without forming cycles. The proposed algorithm ensures that every vertex in the spanning tree has both an in-degree and the tree depth of at most $log_2 n$. When all processes are correct, the degree of each process is exactly $log_2 n$. A spanning tree is dynamically created from any source process and is transparently reconstructed as processes fail or recover. Up to $n-1$ processes can fail, and the correct processes remain connected through a scalable, functioning spanning tree. To build and maintain the tree, processes use the VCube virtual topology, which also serves as a failure detector. Two broadcast algorithms based on the autonomic spanning tree algorithm are presented: one for best-effort broadcast and one for reliable broadcast. Simulation results are provided, including comparisons with other alternatives."

A popular scenario is the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., Circumstellar Interaction (CSI). Uncovering the progenitor system of SNe Ic-CSM plays a critical role in understanding the final evolution of a massive star to a bare C+O star. In this Letter, we present observations of SN 2022esa which we show is an SN Ic-CSM. Surprisingly, a stable periodicity of ~32 days is found in its light-curve evolution with a hint of a slowly increasing period over ~200 days. We argue that the main power source is likely the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich CSM, while the energy input by the post-SN eccentric binary interaction within the SN ejecta is another possibility. In either case, we propose a massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) star as the progenitor, in a WR-WR or WR-BH (black hole) binary that will eventually evolve to a BH-BH binary. Specifically, in the CSI scenario, the progenitor system is an eccentric binary system with an orbital period of about a year, leading to the observed periodicity through the modulation in the CSM density structure. We also show that some other objects, superluminous SN I 2018ibb (a pair-instability SN candidate) and peculiar SN Ic 2022jli (the first example showing stable periodic modulation), show observational similarities to SNe Ic-CSM and may be categorized as SN Ic-CSM variants.

Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth."

    "abstract": "Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios."

In particular, we focus on the Hilbert curve, whose locality-preserving structure minimizes the range of effective interactions in the mapped model. This enables a more compact matrix product state (MPS) representation compared to conventional snake mapping. Through systematic benchmarks, we show that the Hilbert curve consistently yields lower ground-state energies at fixed bond dimension, with the advantage increasing for larger system sizes and in physically relevant interaction regimes. Our implementation reaches clusters up to $32\\times32$ sites with open and periodic boundary conditions, delivering reliable ground-state energies and correlation functions in agreement with established results, but at significantly reduced computational cost. These findings establish space-filling curve mappings, particularly the Hilbert curve, as a powerful tool for extending tensor-network studies of strongly correlated two-dimensional quantum systems beyond the limits accessible with standard approaches."

In this paper we analyze six different beaconless geocast protocols, focusing on two relevant 1D scenarios. The selection of protocols reflects the most relevant types of protocols proposed in the literature, including those evaluated in previous computer simulations. We present a formal and structured analysis of the maximum number of messages that a node can receive, for each protocol, in each of the two scenarios. This is a measure of the network load incurred by each protocol. Our analysis, that for some of the protocols requires an involved probabilistic analysis, confirms behaviors that had been observed only through simulations before."

Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing."

In the context of education, these technologies offer new opportunities to study cognitive and affective processes such as engagement, attention, and performance. However, the lack of scalable, synchronized, and high-resolution tools for multimodal data acquisition continues to be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Multimodal Learning Analytics in real-world educational settings. This paper presents two complementary tools developed to address these challenges: Watch-DMLT, a data acquisition application for Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatches that enables real-time, multi-user monitoring of physiological and motion signals; and ViSeDOPS, a dashboard-based visualization system for analyzing synchronized multimodal data collected during oral presentations. We report on a classroom deployment involving 65 students and up to 16 smartwatches, where data streams including heart rate, motion, gaze, video, and contextual annotations were captured and analyzed. Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the proposed system for supporting fine-grained, scalable, and interpretable Multimodal Learning Analytics in real learning environments."

We demonstrate this explicitly for a complete graph and provide a general argument for an arbitrary graph.

    "abstract": "Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies."

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) silicides are an emerging class of materials whose magnetic and relativistic properties remain largely unexplored. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate how electric-field modulation and transition-metal doping influence the magnetic exchange, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in monolayer Ti2Si. Pristine Ti2Si is a dynamically stable ferromagnetic metal with in-plane anisotropy and centrosymmetric bonding, which suppresses DMI even under strong perpendicular electric fields. To overcome this symmetry constraint, we introduce Pt and Co substitution at Ti sites. Co enhances the magnetic exchange, whereas Pt provides strong spin orbit coupling (SOC), and the combined chemical asymmetry breaks inversion symmetry sufficiently to induce a sizable DMI. A Wannier-based tight-binding model captures the orbital-resolved superexchange pathways and reveals a clear hierarchy between a weak Si-mediated channel and a dominant Pt-mediated interlayer channel. First-principles calculations confirm that the Pt-assisted pathway governs the magnitude and sign of the total DMI. Among all configurations, Pt0.5CoTi0.5Si exhibits the strongest chiral interaction, with its intralayer and interlayer contributions favoring opposite rotation senses, namely counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW). Our results establish chemically engineered Ti2Si monolayers as a promising platform for realizing and tuning chiral magnetic textures in 2D silicides."

Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach."

The tractability of these theories lies in the complete characterisation of their gauge structure through holomorphic covering maps. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of generalised covering maps, which define a universal family of interfaces between symmetric product orbifolds. These interfaces coincide with the holographic interfaces that were recently proposed as duals to AdS$_2$ branes in pure NSNS AdS$_3$ backgrounds. The new covering-map description enables efficient evaluation of interface correlators via a generalisation of the Lunin-Mathur method. To organise these computations, we derive a generalised Riemann-Hurwitz formula for interface coverings and introduce novel diagrammatic rules that systematically classify these maps. The new framework allows us to define a concrete grand-canonical ensemble that has the correct properties to compute correlation functions dual to open string scattering amplitudes. Using the generalised Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we explicitly show that the correlators of the ensemble structurally match string perturbation theory to all orders in the string coupling."

Building a strong digital therapeutic alliance has been proposed to address these barriers. This study highlights the need for a conversational therapeutic companion agent (TCA)-based intervention design. Objective: This study aimed to develop a Wizard-of-Oz TCA-centered prototype integrating social-support-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA), ecological momentary intervention (EMI), behavioral activation, and gamification. We evaluated the six-week proof-of-concept efficacy of this intervention among young adults with depressive symptoms. Methods: Korean young adults aged 20--39 years with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were recruited online. The intervention group ($n = 29$) received a six-week TCA-based digital intervention, while the control group ($n = 29$), recruited four weeks later, continued their usual routines. The TCA guided four daily behavioral-activation tasks, three mood assessments, meditation, daily summaries, and weekly mission feedback. Both groups were assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, and 6 using the BDI-II, GAD-7, and Q-LES-Q-SF. Results: Of 58 participants, 57 completed the study (one dropout in the intervention group). At week 6, the intervention group showed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and improvements in quality of life than controls. Adherence was 78\\% for EMA, 51\\% for EMI, and 65\\% for daily routines. Conclusions: The TCA-based digital intervention improved depressive symptoms and quality of life with adherence levels comparable to previous digital health interventions. Future studies should refine the TCA design and conduct larger-scale evaluations."

The 2RC model is applied to a set of twelve batteries using four publicly available datasets obtained from well-established research institutions. The methodology is structured in four stages: first, the 2RC model is selected due to its balance between physical interpretability and computational simplicity; second, experimental charge-discharge cycle data are collected; third, various optimization techniques are applied with the aim of minimizing the error between the experimental data and the response estimated by the model; and finally, accuracy is evaluated using the mean squared error, while computational efficiency is assessed through execution time. Traditional, metaheuristic, and bio-inspired optimization methods are considered, including least squares optimization, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and several nature-inspired variants. It is demonstrated that bio-inspired techniques achieve greater accuracy than traditional methods, without a significant increase in computational cost. In particular, particle swarm optimization shows superior performance in terms of precision and robustness against local minima. It is concluded that the integration of advanced optimization strategies significantly enhances the fidelity of equivalent electrical models, which is essential for accurate estimation of internal states such as state of charge, aging, and service life in lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles and aerospace systems."

Using abundances from the fourth data release of the GALAH spectroscopic survey, we analyzed 104 host stars with 141 confirmed transiting planets. We divide planets at 2.6 Earth radii, the theoretical threshold radius above which planets are unlikely to be pure-water worlds. We find that large-planet hosts are enriched by approximately 0.2 dex in iron and show a possible excess of highly volatile elements (C, N, O), though these measurements are affected by observational limitations, whereas small-planet hosts exhibit an enhanced contribution of the classical rock-forming elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) relative to iron, corresponding to a modest [Rock/Fe] offset of 0.06 dex, which is statistically significant, with a p value of 10^{-4}. These offsets remain significant for alternative radius cuts. A matched control sample of non-planet-host stars shows only weak and mostly statistically insignificant similar trends, confirming that the stronger chemical signatures are linked to the planetary characteristics. As our study relies on transiting planets, it mainly probes short-period systems (periods shorter than 100 days). These results refine the planet-metallicity relation, highlighting the role of the relative balance between iron, volatiles, and rock-forming elements in planet formation."

We reveal a close relationship between the observed ultrafast dynamical processes and two characteristic temperatures: $T_{\\rm CDW}$ ($\\sim$202 K) and $T^*$ ($\\sim$165 K). Two coherent phonon modes are identified: a high-frequency $A_{1g}$ mode ($ω_{1}$) and a lower-frequency $A_{1g}$ CDW amplitude mode ($ω_{2}$). In stark contrast to thermal melting, where phonons soften, the CDW amplitude mode exhibits anomalous hardening (frequency upshift) with increasing pump fluence. We establish this hardening as the direct signature of an ultrafast restoration of the bare lattice potential. The photoexcited carrier plasma screens the long-range electron-phonon interactions that drive the Peierls-like instability, effectively ``undressing\" the soft phonon and driving its frequency toward the stiffer value of the unrenormalized lattice. Furthermore, an abrupt increase in the excited state buildup time above a critical pump fluence marks a sharp boundary to a photoinduced metastable metallic state. These findings demonstrate that the CDW order in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ is governed by a fragile, fluence-tunable competition between excitonic correlations and lattice dynamics."

    "abstract": "Indoor swimming pools (ISPs) consume significant amounts of electrical and thermal energy to ensure the heating of water and air, ventilation, and maintaining adequate humidity levels. This is measured in GWh per year for large installations, such as Olympic swimming pools (SPs). In this paper, the problem is initially addressed using a phenomenological approach at steady state of the air-water coupling, based on a real case study. The aim is to identify the key phenomena and the constraints that are the most sensitive, including those related to water and air quality management. A key action lever is found in evaporation, and more specifically, water temperature and the indoor dewpoint temperature, which act as its precursors. In a second step, two different strategies were tested to reduce energy consumption for water heating. It was determined that a strategy which incorporates night setback in conjunction with a precise restart time yields a maximum gain of 4%. The second strategy aims to enhance the energy recovery of thermal solar panels by enabling slight overheating of the pool. Its large volume provides effective energy storage, with estimated energy savings of up to 17% for a 1___ C overheating. This strategy appears to be a viable option, as it is straightforward to implement. However, the impact of water overheating on the energy consumption of AHU still needs to be analyzed and managed."

    "abstract": "Cell-edge users (CEUs) in cellular networks typically suffer from poor channel conditions due to long distances from serving base stations and physical obstructions, resulting in much lower data rates compared to cell-center users (CCUs). This paper proposes an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-assisted cellular network with intelligent power control to address the performance gap between CEUs and CCUs. Unlike conventional approaches that either deploy UAVs for all users or use no UAV assistance, our model uses a distance-based criterion where only users beyond a reference distance receive UAV relay assistance. Each UAV operates as an amplify-and-forward relay, enabling assisted users to receive signals from both the base station and the UAV simultaneously, thereby achieving diversity gain. To optimize transmission power allocation across base stations, we employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) learning framework that learns power control policies without requiring accurate channel models. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves a peak average rate of 2.28 bps/Hz at the optimal reference distance of 400m, which represents a 3.6% improvement compared to networks without UAV assistance and 0.9% improvement compared to networks where all users receive UAV support. The results also reveal that UAV altitude and reference distance are critical factors affecting system performance, with lower altitudes providing better performance."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) faces a persistent tension: policies that are stable to optimize are often too simple to represent the multimodal action distributions needed for complex control. Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive."

One way to minimize this effect is to use digital-pre-distortion (DPD) modules to linearize the PAs. However, using perfect DPD modules is costly and it may incur significant power consumption. As an alternative, we consider the problem of characterizing non-linearity-aware ZF (NLA-ZF) precoding schemes, hereby defined as linear precoders that achieve perfect interference cancellation in the presence of PA non-linearity by exploiting knowledge of this non-linear response. We provide initial iterative solutions that allow achieving NLA-ZF (up to adjustable tolerance) in a two-UE downlink MU-MIMO scenario where the base station (BS) has an even number of antennas, and each antenna is connected to a PA exhibiting third-order memory-less non-linear behavior. The proposed approach allows for performance gains in scenarios with significant residual interference."

This paper investigates how the timing of centralized intervention affects the management of autonomous agents at a signal-less, orthogonal intersection, while satisfying safety constraints, evaluating efficiency, and ensuring fairness. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach is used to optimize agent coordination within a circular control zone centered at the intersection. We introduce the concept of fairness, measured via pairwise reversal counts, and incorporate fairness constraints into the MILP framework. We then study the relationship between fairness and system efficiency and its impact on platoon formation. Finally, simulation studies analyze the effectiveness of early versus late intervention strategies and fairness-aware control, focusing on safe, efficient, and robust management of agents within the control zone."

Compared to one-dimensional measurements, 3D femtoscopy not only provides a valuable cross-check but also offers a more complete characterization of the source geometry and its dynamical evolution. Particularly, differences between the \"out\" and \"side\" directions are sensitive to signals of a strong first-order phase transition, while the collision-energy dependence of Levy radii may reveal non-monotonic features related to the equation of state (EoS). In this work, we systematically investigate the transverse mass and collision-energy dependence of the three-dimensional femtoscopic parameters of pion pairs with Levy-type sources in the STAR Beam Energy Scan (BES) range from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ to $200$ GeV using the EPOS4 model. The analyzed parameters include the Levy index $α$, the correlation strength $λ$, and the three-dimensional radii $R_{\\rm {out}}$, $R_{\\rm side}$ and $R_{\\rm long}$ , derived quantities such as the radius difference $R_{\\rm diff} = R_{\\rm out}^2 - R_{\\rm side}^2$ and the ratio $R_{\\rm out}/R_{\\rm side}$ are also investigated. The results show that the extracted radii $R_{\\rm {side}}$ and $R_{\\rm long}$ decrease with increasing transverse momentum and increase gradually with collision energy, while $R_{\\rm {out}}$ shows little energy dependence. The Levy index $α$ exhibits only a mild dependence on $m_T$ and collision energy, whereas the correlation strength $λ$ shows a clear $m_T$ dependence and generally decreases with increasing collision energy. A comparison with EPOS3 results indicates general agreement within approximately 2$σ$, with the notable exception of $R_{\\rm side}$, which is systematically smaller in EPOS4."

Current ethical frameworks in this domain often implicitly rely on contested functionalist assumptions, prioritize speculative AI welfare over concrete human interests, and lack coherent theoretical foundations. We address these limitations through a structured three-level framework grounded in philosophical uncertainty. At the foundational level, we establish five factual determinations about AI consciousness alongside human-centralism as our meta-ethical stance. These foundations logically entail three operational principles: presumption of no consciousness (placing the burden of proof on consciousness claims), risk prudence (prioritizing human welfare under uncertainty), and transparent reasoning (enabling systematic evaluation and adaptation). At the application level, the third component of our framework, we derive default positions on pressing ethical questions through a transparent logical process where each position can be explicitly traced back to our foundational commitments. Our approach balances philosophical rigor with practical guidance, distinguishes consciousness from anthropomorphism, and creates pathways for responsible evolution as scientific understanding advances, providing a human-centric foundation for navigating these profound ethical challenges."

Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail."

In this regime, parametric resonance may arise, with nonlinear free-surface dynamics driving large-amplitude waves, interface break-up, and severe sloshing-induced mixing. In this work, we identify and characterize the distinct sloshing regimes associated with the lowest-frequency parametric instability, specifically when the external forcing frequency approaches twice the lowest natural frequency. Experiments were conducted in a transparent cylindrical tank with diameter D = 134.5 mm and length L = 336.3 mm. This work presents a data-driven approach for regime identification and classification that relies solely on high-speed video recordings and circumvents the need for interface tracking. The method combines prototype-based data labeling with dimensionality reduction via multiscale proper orthogonal decomposition (mPOD) and automatic kernel-based classification. The results are summarized in a dimensionless regime map across three fill ratios, where stable waves, longitudinal and transverse mode shapes, and mode-competition regimes are distinguished. The developed map provides a predictive tool for assessing sloshing-induced loads, supporting structural and operational optimization of fuel systems."

Using the Cosmicflows-4 catalogue, we mapped the angular and radial variations of $H_0$ in radial shells with a distance modulus $μ\\in [29,36]$ (approximately corresponding to $[20,100]$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc) and equal-area sky patches, applied adaptive weighing, and fitted spherical harmonics up to the octupole. Our results reveal a clear, distance-decreasing dipole that remains coherent across shells, with subdominant higher-order multipoles, and the octupole fit capturing the main anisotropic features except in sparsely sampled or SDSS-dominated shells. The direction and amplitude of the dipole depend on whether the observed radial recessional velocities are corrected for peculiar velocities or not. If the correction is not applied, the dipole aligns with the major gravitational structures in the local universe. If it is applied, a global dipole still seems to be present, but the signal is much weaker and with much lower statistical significance. This decrease in the amplitude of the dipole supports the idea of a differential expansion rate in our universe, but does not clarify whether the origin is astrophysical or cosmological. Finally, we verify that, while this anisotropy could influence local measurements of the Hubble constant, its effect on the large-scale Hubble tension appears to be limited, as the distribution of galaxies hosting SNeIa, both used as calibrators to constrain $H_0$ and in the Hubble-flow, does not show a strong correlation with the dipole signal."

This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design. We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects. We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies. Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples. Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem."

Instead of driven by the enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction due to broken inversion symmetry at heterointerfaces, this emergent state arises intrinsically from the interplay of dipolar interactions and magnetic frustration, leading to the stabilization of topological phases in much thicker films.

This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities."

    "abstract": "Test time Adaptation is a promising approach for mitigating domain shift in medical image segmentation; however, current evaluations remain limited in terms of modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency. We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\\tilde{\\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\\tilde{\\oo}(δ^{-1}ε^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we release an open-source Python library that can be easily adapted from existing solvers. Our code is available here: https://github.com/guaguakai/FFOLayer."

Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model."

Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems."

However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model. Furthermore, we release TokenPowerBench as open source to help users to measure power consumption, forecast operating expenses, and meet sustainability targets when deploying LLM services."

Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

We prove that any cycle of this type in the graph of an ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope corresponds to a hyperbolic link such that its complement consists of $4$-copies of this polytope glued according to its checkerboard coloring. Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. For such cycles we prove that the $3$-antiprism $A(3)$ (octahedron) has exactly $2$ combinatorially different cycles, the $4$-antiprism $A(4)$ has exactly $7$ combinatorially different cycles, and these cycles correspond to $7$ cycles (perhaps combinatorially equivalent) on any polytope different from antiprisms, and any antiprism $A(k)$ has at least $2$ combinatorially different cycles. The $2$-fold branched covering space corresponding to our link is a small cover over some simple $3$-polytope. This small cover is defined by a Hamiltonian cycle on it. We show that any compact hyperbolic $3$-polytope with a Hamiltonian cycle arises in this way."

    "abstract": "An excitonic insulator (EI) is a charge-neutral bosonic condensate of spontaneously formed electron-hole pairs. Exotic quantum phenomena such as dissipationless charge neutral transport and huge potential for optoelectronic applications have led to an extensive search for intrinsic bulk materials that are EIs at ambient pressure without sophisticated device fabrication. The narrow gap semimetal Ta2NiSe5 has been proposed as a rare example of an intrinsic EI, but its ground state has remained controversial since the EI phase transition is accompanied by a structural distortion. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to present microscopic evidence that supports an excitonic origin of the insulating phase in Ta2NiSe5. First, we find that the insulating gap persists at structural domain boundaries where the bulk structural distortion is absent suggesting that the structural distortion is not the primary origin of insulating ground state. Second, the insulating gap is suppressed at localized charge puddles which indicates that charge correlations are important in producing the insulating gap. Finally, the decay length of the in-gap states at the puddles shows similar value to the estimated size of the exciton wavefunction from previous photoemission studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ta2NiSe5 is an EI and may be a versatile platform to study the physics of bosonic condensates in solid-state system at ambient conditions."

We show that initializing with n T-states and adding a second T-layer after a causally covered Clifford evolution yields consistent OTOC decay and WD statistics. This also enables deeper understanding of the circuit structures that generate complex entanglement behavior. Notably, our work suggests polylogarithmic-depth deterministic circuits suffice to approximate chaotic behavior, highlighting that causal connectivity is sufficient for operator spreading to induce Wigner-Dyson entanglement statistics and OTOC decay."

In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a \"hard-to-easy\" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning."

The model is highly accessible to rigorous mathematical analysis, and has been studied as a paradigm for effects like total and partial synchronization. Most initial conditions $\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}$ lead to total synchronization. The plethora of $2^N-1$ (circles of) partially synchronized states, however, is unstable. The precise behavior of transitions to synchrony seems to have eluded description. In the present paper, we address this gap. By the gradient structure of (*), the global dynamics decompose into equilibria and heteroclinic orbits between them. Except for the extremes of total instability and total synchrony, all equilibria are 2-cluster solutions: their phase angles $\\vartheta_j$ attain only two values, with a phase difference of $π$ between them. Any heteroclinic orbit between 2-cluster equilibria, or towards synchrony, can be realized as a 3-cluster rebellion. Cluster rebellions split the smaller, \"slim\", minority cluster of the source equilibrium and send the rebellious part to join the bigger, \"fat\", majority cluster. Heteroclinic transversality identifies the Kuramoto model as a structurally stable Morse-Smale system. In particular, heteroclinic orbits can be concatenated in finite time. The options involved in successive cluster rebellions amount to finite symbol sequences of 2-shift type. The paper is dedicated to Professor Yoshiki Kuramoto, with admiration."

Chemical reactions can, in principle, control droplet sizes, but there are no clear guidelines on how to robustly achieve size control. To provide guidelines, we consider a binary fluid model driven out of equilibrium by chemical reactions. We reveal two different classes of size-controlled droplets, depending on the ratio of droplet radius to the reaction-diffusion length. Moreover, we determine parameter regimes in which droplets become small. Taken together, our theory allows us to separately predict the chemical reactions necessary for maintaining droplets of a given class or size."

Moreover, the brand value of firms also appears a statistically significant determinant of premium sales, but its size impact remains limited comparing to brand trust, i.e. a million TL increase in brand value generates only 0.02 million TL increase in sales.

    "abstract": "We revisit the neutron-deuteron scattering using the Wave-Packet Continuum Discretization (WPCD) method with the EKM chiral nuclear force at various chiral orders. We rederive the permutation operator and solve the Faddeev-AGS equations directly, without rewriting the initial Faddeev kernel $tG_0$ and introducing pseudo-states, thereby rendering the approach easily extendable to a relativistic framework. We find that up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO), although one can well describe the differential cross sections, one cannot resolve the long-standing $A_y$ puzzle, consistent with previous studies. The fact that the N$^3$LO chiral forces can well describe the $NN$ phase shifts and the results obtained with the EKM and Idaho N$^3$LO chiral forces agree with each other underscores the need for further investigations to resolve the $A_y$ puzzle, e.g., considering three-body forces or relativistic effects."

    "abstract": "AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics."

Despite its importance, benchmarks for scRNA-seq clustering methods remain fragmented, often lacking standardized protocols and failing to incorporate recent advances in artificial intelligence. To fill these gaps, we present scCluBench, a comprehensive benchmark of clustering algorithms for scRNA-seq data. First, scCluBench provides 36 scRNA-seq datasets collected from diverse public sources, covering multiple tissues, which are uniformly processed and standardized to ensure consistency for systematic evaluation and downstream analyses. To evaluate performance, we collect and reproduce a range of scRNA-seq clustering methods, including traditional, deep learning-based, graph-based, and biological foundation models. We comprehensively evaluate each method both quantitatively and qualitatively, using core performance metrics as well as visualization analyses. Furthermore, we construct representative downstream biological tasks, such as marker gene identification and cell type annotation, to further assess the practical utility. scCluBench then investigates the performance differences and applicability boundaries of various clustering models across diverse analytical tasks, systematically assessing their robustness and scalability in real-world scenarios. Overall, scCluBench offers a standardized and user-friendly benchmark for scRNA-seq clustering, with curated datasets, unified evaluation protocols, and transparent analyses, facilitating informed method selection and providing valuable insights into model generalizability and application scope."

    "abstract": "Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Since the classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller has continued to be the most widely used feedback methods in engineering systems by far, it is crucial to investigate the working mechanism of PID in dealing with nonlinearity, uncertainty and random noises. Recently, Zhao and Guo (2022) has established the global stability of PID control for a class of uncertain nonlinear control systems with relative degree two without random perturbations. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of nonlinear stochastic systems with an arbitrary relative degree $n$, and discuss the stability and design of extended PID controller (a natural extension of PID). We demonstrate that, the closed-loop control systems will be globally stable in mean square with bounded tracking errors provided the extended PID parameters are selected from an $(n+1)$-dimensional unbounded set, even if both the system nonlinear drift and diffusion terms contain a wide range of structural uncertainties. Moreover, the steady-state tracking error is proved to be proportional to the noise intensity at the setpoint, which can also be made arbitrarily small by choosing the controller parameters suitably large."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs."

However, relability requirements imposed by the industrial context, such as ensuring bounded transmission latency, are a major challenge for over-the-air communication. One of the aspects of Wi-Fi technology that greatly affects the probability of a packet reaching its destination is the selection of the appropriate transmission rate. Rate adaptation algorithms are in charge of this operation, but their design and implementation are not regulated by the IEEE 802.11 standard. One of the most popular solutions, available as open source, is Minstrel, which is the default choice for the Linux Kernel. In this paper, Minstrel performance is evaluated for both static and mobility scenarios. Our analysis focuses on metrics of interest for industrial contexts, i.e., latency and packet loss ratio, and serves as a preliminary evaluation for the future development of enhanced rate adaptation algorithms based on centralized digital twins."

In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \\& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes."

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules."

This second-order instability (named envelope instability) is driven by space-charge effects and has significant impact on the operational regimes of particle accelerators. Our study delves into the three-dimensional envelope instability, incorporating both transverse and longitudinal coupling. Conventionally, analyzing this complex system would necessitate solving 441 ordinary differential equations, which is computationally intractable. However, by employing auto-differentiation, we were able to track only 21 equations. This approach allowed us to uncover an additional instability stopband, which arises from space-charge-induced coupling and has not been reported in previous studies. This research highlights the significant advantages of auto-differentiation in analyzing complicated dynamical systems involving a large number of ordinary differential equations."

This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents."

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity of space infrastructures is an emerging topic, despite space-related cybersecurity incidents occurring as early as 1977 (i.e., hijacking of a satellite transmission signal). There is no single dataset that documents cyber attacks against space infrastructures that have occurred in the past; instead, these incidents are often scattered in media reports while missing many details, which we dub the missing-data problem. Nevertheless, even ``low-quality'' datasets containing such reports would be extremely valuable because of the dearth of space cybersecurity data and the sensitivity of space infrastructures which are often restricted from disclosure by governments. This prompts a research question: How can we characterize real-world cyber attacks against space infrastructures? In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a framework, including metrics, while also addressing the missing-data problem by leveraging methodologies such as the Space Attack Research and Tactic Analysis (SPARTA) and the Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) to ``extrapolate'' the missing data in a principled fashion. We show how the extrapolated data can be used to reconstruct ``hypothetical but plausible'' space cyber kill chains and space cyber attack campaigns that have occurred in practice. To show the usefulness of the framework, we extract data for 108 cyber attacks against space infrastructures and show how to extrapolate this ``low-quality'' dataset containing missing information to derive 6,206 attack technique-level space cyber kill chains. Our findings include: cyber attacks against space infrastructures are getting increasingly sophisticated; successful protection of the link segment between the space and user segments could have thwarted nearly half of the 108 attacks. We will make our dataset available."

However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport."

We illustrate its behavior on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the Iris benchmark, and a high-imbalance resource-allocation scenario, showing that the index provides a coherent assessment even when traditional metrics give incomplete or misleading signals. Moreover, in resource-allocation settings, we demonstrate that BSI not only detects severe density-geometry inconsistency with high sensitivity, but also offers a smooth, optimization-ready objective that naturally favors allocations balancing demographic weight with each group's effective spread in the outcome space, while providing a smooth, gradient-friendly regularizer that can be easily embedded in modern policy-making and algorithmic governance optimization frameworks."

Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

    "abstract": "In the study of non-adiabatic chemical processes such as photocatalysis and photosynthesis, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) is an indispensable theoretical tool, which requires precise potential energy surfaces (PESs) of ground and excited states. Quantum computing offers promising potential for calculating PESs that are intractable for classical computers. However, its realistic application poses significant challenges to the development of quantum algorithms that are sufficiently general to enable efficient and precise PES calculations across chemical systems with diverse properties, as well as to seamlessly adapt existing NAMD theories to quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum-adapted extension to the Landau-Zener-Surface-Hopping (LZSH) NAMD. This extension incorporates curvature-driven hopping corrections that protect the population evolution while maintaining the efficiency gained from avoiding the computation of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs), as well as preserving the trajectory independence that enables parallelization. Furthermore, to ensure the high-precision PESs required for surface hopping dynamics, we develop a sub-microhartree-accurate PES calculation protocol. This protocol supports active space selection, enables parallel acceleration either on quantum or classical clusters, and demonstrates adaptability to diverse chemical systems - including the charged H3+ ion and the C2H4 molecule, a prototypical multi-reference benchmark. This work paves the way for practical application of quantum computing in NAMD, showcasing the potential of parallel simulation on quantum-classical heterogeneous clusters for ab-initio computational chemistry."

    "abstract": "This paper develops an algorithm to reconstruct large weighted firm-to-firm networks using information about the size of the firms and sectoral input-output flows. Our algorithm is based on a four-step procedure. We first generate a matrix of probabilities of connections between all firms in the economy using an augmented gravity model embedded in a logistic function that takes firm size as mass. The model is parameterized to allow for the probability of a link between two firms to depend not only on their sizes but also on flows across the sectors to which they belong. We then use a Bernoulli draw to construct a directed but unweighted random graph from the probability distribution generated by the logistic-gravity function. We make the graph aperiodic by adding self-loops and irreducible by adding links between Strongly Connected Components while limiting distortions to sectoral flows. We convert the unweighted network to a weighted network by solving a convex quadratic programming problem that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the weights. The solution preserves the observed firm sizes and sectoral flows within reasonable bounds, while limiting the strength of the self-loops. Computationally, the algorithm is O(N2) in the worst case, but it can be evaluated in O(N) via sector-wise binning of firm sizes, albeit with an approximation error. We implement the algorithm to reconstruct the full US production network with more than 5 million firms and 100 million buyer-seller connections. The reconstructed network exhibits topological properties consistent with small samples of the real US buyer-seller networks, including fat-tails in degree distribution, mild clustering, and near-zero reciprocity. We provide open-source code of the algorithm to enable researchers to reconstruct large-scale granular production networks from publicly available data."

    "abstract": "Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

    "abstract": "Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \\emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks."

However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

We introduce MolAS, a lightweight algorithm selection system that predicts per-algorithm performance from pretrained protein-ligand embeddings using attentional pooling and a shallow residual decoder. With only hundreds to a few thousand labelled complexes, MolAS achieves up to 15% absolute improvement over the single-best solver (SBS) and closes 17-66% of the Virtual Best Solver (VBS)-SBS gap across five diverse docking benchmarks. Analyses of reliability, embedding geometry, and solver-selection patterns show that MolAS succeeds when the oracle landscape exhibits low entropy and separable solver behaviour, but collapses under protocol-induced hierarchy shifts. These findings indicate that the main barrier to robust docking AS is not representational capacity but instability in solver rankings across pose-generation regimes, positioning MolAS as both a practical in-domain selector and a diagnostic tool for assessing when AS is feasible."

The lengths of these codes can reach up to $\\frac{q+3}{2}$ (for finite fields of odd characteristic) and $\\frac{q+4}{2}$ (for even characteristic), respectively. Owing to their special structure, we can use the Cauchy matrix method to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for these codes to be MDS codes and non-GRS MDS codes. Additionally, the inequivalence between these codes and twisted GRS codes is analyzed. Furthermore, we analyze the relationships among several existing classes of codes used for constructing non-GRS MDS codes, propose explicit constructions, and discuss the lengths of non-GRS MDS codes based on these constructions. Finally, we design two efficient algorithms to address two main problems in GRS code research, i.e., determining whether an unknown code $C$ is a GRS code from its generator matrix $G$, and recovering the key vectors $\\bmα$ and $\\bm{v}$ such that $C = \\GRS_{n,k}(\\bmα, \\bm{v})$ if $C$ is indeed a GRS code.

However, an estimation of molecular and atomic gas reservoirs at high redshift relies on various indirect tracers, while robust dust mass measurements require multi-band far-infrared continuum observations. We take census of the full baryonic content of the main-sequence star-forming galaxy HZ10 at $z=5.65$, a unique case study where all necessary tracers are available. We present new ALMA Band 10 ($λ_\\mathrm{rest}=50μ$m) and Band 4 ($300μ$m) observations towards HZ10, which combined with previously taken ALMA Band 6 through 9 data ($70-200μ$m) constrains its dust properties. We complete the baryonic picture using archival high-resolution [CII] observations that provide both a dynamical mass and molecular and atomic gas mass estimates, a JVLA CO(2-1)-based molecular gas mass, and JWST metallicity and stellar mass measurements. We detect continuum emission from HZ10 in Bands 10 and 4 at the $3.4-4.0σ$ level, and measure a dust temperature of $T_\\mathrm{dust} = 37_{-5}^{+6}$K and dust mass $\\log(M_\\mathrm{dust}/M_\\odot) = 8.0 \\pm 0.1$. Leveraging the dynamical constraints, we infer its total gas budget, and find that commonly used [CII]-to-H$_2$ and [CII]-to-HI conversions overpredict the gas mass relative to the dynamical mass. For this reason, we derive a [CII]-to-total ISM mass (atomic + molecular) conversion factor, which for HZ10 corresponds to $α_\\mathrm{[CII]}^\\mathrm{ISM} = 39^{+50}_{-25}M_\\odot L_\\odot^{-1}$. We also find that HZ10 falls below the local scaling relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, suggesting inefficient ISM dust growth. These results demonstrate a powerful synergy between ALMA and JWST in disentangling the baryonic components of early galaxies, paving the way for future studies of larger samples."

The second is to form a low-rank approximation to the matrix using the whole Krylov space produced by the test vectors, rather than the output of a single power iteration as is used by XTrace. Experiments on synthetic data show that the first modification offers only slight benefits in practice, while the second can lead to significant improvements depending on the spectrum of the matrix."

    "abstract": "The 21st-century information landscape presents an unprecedented challenge: how do individuals make sound trust decisions amid complexity, polarization, and misinformation? Traditional rational-agent models fail to capture human trust formation, which involves a complex synthesis of reason, character, and pre-rational intuition. This report introduces the Moral-Epistemic VIRtue informed (MEVIR) framework, a comprehensive descriptive model integrating three theoretical perspectives: (1) a procedural model describing evidence-gathering and reasoning chains; (2) Linda Zagzebski's virtue epistemology, characterizing intellectual disposition and character-driven processes; and (3) Extended Moral Foundations Theory (EMFT), explaining rapid, automatic moral intuitions that anchor reasoning. Central to the framework are ontological concepts - Truth Bearers, Truth Makers, and Ontological Unpacking-revealing that disagreements often stem from fundamental differences in what counts as admissible reality. MEVIR reframes cognitive biases as systematic failures in applying epistemic virtues and demonstrates how different moral foundations lead agents to construct separate, internally coherent \"trust lattices\". Through case studies on vaccination mandates and climate policy, the framework shows that political polarization represents deeper divergence in moral priors, epistemic authorities, and evaluative heuristics. The report analyzes how propaganda, psychological operations, and echo chambers exploit the MEVIR process. The framework provides foundation for a Decision Support System to augment metacognition, helping individuals identify biases and practice epistemic virtues. The report concludes by acknowledging limitations and proposing longitudinal studies for future research."

We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\\leq$2\\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters."

This work demonstrates experimental evidence of time-domain dynamics of magnon-photon systems that are coupled through a long-range interaction (i.e. remote coupling) exhibiting level attraction mediated by an auxiliary mode. We directly observe the temporal evolution of dissipatively coupled cavity-magnon modes, where heavily damped transmission line modes mediate the interaction. Our frequency-domain measurements confirm the predicted level attraction, while time-domain ring-down measurements reveal the characteristic signatures of dissipative coupling dynamics. Our approach offers in situ tunability over the dissipative coupling strength, including complete suppression, without requiring physical modifications to the experimental setup, providing a versatile platform for exploring tunable, non-Hermitian physics."

In this context, the purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the main risk management methodologies applied to data science projects, aiming to identify, classify, and synthesize their similarities, differences and existing gaps. An integrative literature review was performed using indexed databases and a structured protocol for selection and content analysis. The study examines widely adopted risk management standards ISO 31000, PMBOK Risk Management and NIST RMF, as well as frameworks specific to data science workflows, such as CRISP DM and the recently proposed DS EthiCo RMF, which incorporates ethical and sociotechnical dimensions into the project life cycle. The findings reveal that traditional approaches provide limited coverage of emerging risks, whereas contemporary models propose multidimensional structures capable of integrating ethical oversight, governance and continuous monitoring. As a contribution, this work offers theoretical support for the development of hybrid frameworks that balance technical efficiency, organizational alignment and responsible data practices, while highlighting research gaps that can guide future investigations."

Our main result shows that, in fact, $d\\geq (\\log n)^{Ω(1)}$, which is tight up to the constant in the exponent. Our techniques also show that if the probes are nonadaptive, then $d\\geq n^{Ω(1)}$, which is an exponential improvement over the previous nonadaptive lower bound due to Yu and Zhan (ITCS 2024). Our results also imply lower bounds against succinct data structures for storing permutations."

Our analysis uncovers robust Quantum Valley Hall Insulating (QVHI) phase and reveals that long-range interactions alone can mediate the interlayer electron tunneling, generating topologically nontrivial bands even in the absence of the corresponding single-particle hopping. Additionally, we show that in the case of band mixing terms originating both from the interaction and single particle physics a competition between topological states realizing $s$-$wave$ and $p\\pm ip$-$wave$ symmetries can appear. Moreover, within the considered theoretical framework, we present that by introducing a small Zeeman field, one can lift the band inversion in one of the valleys. This leads to a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulating (QAHI) state with the topological gap opening in a single valley and the other being topologically trivial."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs."

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup."

We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes. Our findings establish ALDI++ as an efficient solution for domain-adaptive object detection, setting a new benchmark for performance stability and cross-domain generalization in security X-ray imagery."

First, we show that FRTDs are strictly more informative than eigenvalue spectra, yet insufficient for complete graph identification, thus placing FRTD equivalence between cospectrality and isomorphism. Second, we argue that FRTD equivalence between nodes captures structural similarity. Third, we empirically demonstrate that the FRTD embedding outperforms manually designed graph metrics in network alignment tasks. Finally, we show that random networks that approximately match the FRTD of a desired target also preserve other salient features. Together these results demonstrate the FRTD as a simple and mathematically principled embedding for complex networks."

We systematically classify all these processes that change lepton flavor by one unit and formulate their decay widths in terms of the dim-6 LEFT Wilson coefficients. By applying constraints on these Wilson coefficients derived from current experimental limits on BNV two-body nucleon decays, we obtain stringent and robust bounds on the rates of these triple-lepton modes. These bounds vary significantly from one dim-6 operator to another under consideration. Our results for the $Δ(B-L)=0$ modes differ by several orders of magnitude from previous phase-space estimates in the literature, thereby providing a more reliable assessment of their potential occurrence. In addition, we provide improved bounds on $Δ(B+L)=0$ modes compared to the existing experimental limits."

Moreover, in many practical scenarios of games the zero-sum assumption needs to be relaxed. To address these issues, we define a new intermediate class of monotone near-zero-sum games that contains monotone zero-sum games as a special case. Then, we present a novel algorithm that transforms the near-zero-sum games into a sequence of zero-sum subproblems, improving the gradient-based complexity for the class.

In geographically, culturally and economically diverse countries like Turkiye, determining the socioeconomic status of the provinces and regional differences is an important step for planning and implementing effective policies. Therefore, this study aims to determine the socioeconomic disparities of the provinces in Turkiye. For this purpose, a socioeconomic development index covering the economic and social dimensions of 81 provinces was constructed. For the index, 16 different indicators representing economic and social factors were used. These indicators were converted into indices using the Min-Max normalization method and Principal Component Analysis. Afterwards, using these indices, the provinces were divided into groups using the K-Means clustering algorithm and the Elbow method. In the last part of the study, the results are presented in a visual format using Scatter Plots, clustering maps and QGIS mapping tools. The results of the study show that 2 of the 81 provinces in Turkiye have very high, 30 high, 25 medium and 24 low socioeconomic indices. Istanbul and Ankara have very high socioeconomic status. In general, the provinces in western Turkiye have a high socioeconomic index, while the provinces in eastern and southeastern Anatolia face serious challenges in terms of socioeconomic indicators."

It means that there is a preferential heating of the lattice degrees of freedom in the specific directions of the Brillouin zone, in particular, in the direction opposite to the tilt velocity in the model considered by us. This observation will have novel consequences: (1) With pump-probe spectroscopy applied to a given tilted Dirac cone material an anisotropic relaxation would lead to a transient anisotropic heating which can further lead to a transient Seebeck effect as transient thermal gradients would exist in the specific directions of the BZ, and (2) this direction of anisotropic heating can be controlled by controlling the direction of the tilt velocity which can be externally tuned by the application of an external pressure. We foresee novel applications of this effect in ultrafast sensor applications involving transient heating effects. This is equivalent to inducing a transient Seebeck effect by just shinning light on a tilted Dirac cone material!"

Most current governance practices still rely on single-agent safety containment, prompts, fine-tuning, and moderation layers that constrain individual model behavior but leave the dynamics of multi-model interaction ungoverned. These mechanisms assume a dyadic setting: one model responding to one user under stable oversight. Yet research and industrial development are rapidly shifting toward LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, where outputs are recursively reused as inputs across chains of agents. In such systems, local compliance can aggregate into collective failure even when every model is individually aligned. We propose a conceptual transition from model-level safety to system-level safety, introducing the framework of the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) to formalize how instability arises from interaction structure rather than from isolated misbehavior. The paper contributes (i) a theoretical account of collective risk in interacting LLMs, (ii) a taxonomy connecting micro, meso, and macro-level failure modes, and (iii) a design proposal for InstitutionalAI, an architecture for embedding adaptive oversight within multi-agent systems."

In particular we concentrate on the simplest nontrivial case of two electrons in a box potential and calculate analytically the energy splitting between the lowest spatially symmetric and antisymmetric states, which is a relevant energy scale for the magnetic properties of the system. In the approximation of a fixed center of mass coordinate, the splitting decays exponentially with the square root of the distance between the electrons at the leading order. We show that the subleading exponential correction significantly increases the splitting and thus becomes crucial in order to describe correctly the exact numerical data for system sizes that are not astronomically large. Two methods of calculation of the energy splitting are developed. The first is based on the analysis of the exact solution that can be expressed in terms of the Whittaker functions. It applies at all values of the short-distance cutoff played by the width of one-dimensional wire that regularizes the Coulomb potential. The second method is based on the quasiclassical (or Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, which applies only for sufficiently large values of the cutoff. The two methods give identical result in the overlapping region. As a side result, our study gives the energy splitting in a triangular double well potential of inverse ``M'' shape."

Moreover, the requirement of orbital orthogonality between the valence and core electron wave functions, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle, should be the driven force for the electron interstitial localization; and the exertion of external pressure modifies the available space to accommodate the electronic wave functions, thus enhances the interstitial localization. These discoveries lay down the ground for searching for promising electrides that are practicable at ambient conditions."

Here we review the main families of higher-order measures with the explicit goal of translating mathematical properties into defensible mechanistic inferences. First, we systematize Shannon-based multivariate metrics and demonstrate that higher-order dependence is parsimoniously characterized by two largely independent axes: interaction strength and redundancy-synergy balance. We argue that balanced layering of synergistic integration and redundant broadcasting optimizes multiscale complexity, formalizing a computation-communication tradeoff. We then examine the partial information decomposition and outline pragmatic considerations for its deployment in neural data. Equipped with the relevant mathematical essentials, we connect redundancy-synergy balance to cognitive function by progressively embedding their mathematical properties in real-world constraints, starting with small synthetic systems before gradually building up to neuroimaging. We close by identifying key future directions for mechanistic insight: cross-scale bridging, intervention-based validation, and thermodynamically grounded unification of information dynamics."

We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Medium-induced radiation effects, implemented in leading-order direct and fragmentation photon processes, are computed for pPb collisions at the LHC. At backward rapidity, photons are sensitive to fully coherent energy loss (FCEL), while at forward rapidity, fully coherent energy gain (FCEG) plays a crucial role due to the dominance of the $qg \\to qγ$ scattering channel. In contrast, for virtual photon production, the impact of fully coherent radiation is marginal, making Drell-Yan (DY) one of the best ways to probe nuclear PDFs. The power of the DY process is demonstrated by reweighting nPDF sets at next-to-leading order using realistic pseudo-data for LHC Run 3."

    "abstract": "The optical properties of molecular crystals are largely determined by the excitonic coupling of neighboring molecules. This coupling is extremely sensitive to the arrangement of adjacent molecular units, as their electronic interaction is defined by the relative orientation of the individual transition dipole moments and their wave function overlap. Hence, the optical properties, such as fluorescence, are usually highly anisotropic and good indicators of structural changes during the variation of intensive thermodynamic parameters like temperature or pressure. Here, we discuss the peculiar though archetypical case of $β$-phase zinc-phthalocyanine: In single crystals, we report a sudden change of spectral emission with temperature from a broad, unpolarized Frenkel-exciton type luminescence to a narrow, highly polarized superradiance-like fluorescence below 80 K. Surprisingly, we find that there is no sign of a discrete structural phase transition in this temperature regime. To understand this apparent contradiction, we perform polarization-, temperature- and time-dependent photoluminescence measurements along different crystallographic directions to fully map the emission characteristics of the crystal-exciton. By means of ab-initio calculations on a density functional theory level we conclude that our observations are consistent with a dimer exciton model when considering thermalized electronic states. As such, our study presents a representative case study on a well-established molecular material class demonstrating that caution is advised when attributing discrete changes in electronic observables to a structural phase transition. As we show for zinc-phthalocyanine in its $β$-phase modification, slowly varying excitonic couplings and thermal redistribution of excitations can mimic the same signatures attributed to a structural phase transition."

    "abstract": "As pointed out by Nambu-Goldstone, continuous symmetry breaking gives rise to gapless bosonic excitation. In superconductors, continuous local U(1) gauge symmetry is broken. The gapless excitation thus created is the collective phase mode of a superconductor. In 1962, Anderson pointed out that Coulomb interaction lifts this gapless mode to the superconducting plasma frequency. Therefore, in a superconducting fluid there are no bosonic excitations below the Cooper pair binding energy. Anderson mechanism also implies that the massless photon becomes massive in a superconductor. It provides a microscopic theory for dissipationless charge transport (with Landau criterion for superfluidity) and the Meissner effect in a superconductor. Jumping to particle physics, to explain why the gauge bosons for electroweak interaction are massive, Higgs, Englert, Kibble et al. proposed the existence of the Higgs field. This matter field couples to the massless W, Z bosons and generates mass via the Higgs mechanism. Due to their conceptual similarities, these two mechanisms are referred to as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. In 2013, the detection of the Higgs boson provided the final proof for the Higgs hypothesis decades after its conception. The amplitude mode of a superconductor, which corresponds to the Higgs boson in the above analogy, is referred to as the Higgs mode. Its spectroscopic detection has also remained elusive for decades. In recent years, the development of ultrafast techniques enabled an effective approach for studying the mode. Here, we introduce the Higgs mode from a perspective of why superconductors superconduct and review the recent development in Higgs spectroscopy, particularly in the field of nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy. We discuss the novel insights that may be learnt from these studies for future high-Tc superconductivity and correlated materials research in general."

It unifies Dyson-Schwinger dynamics of quark propagation, functional renormalization-group evolution of the scale-dependent effective action, and Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio thermodynamics for chiral and deconfinement order parameters. It also includes a holographic Maxwell-Chern-Simons sector that supplies baryonic and topological response within a single, renormalization group consistent framework. Within this construction the axial-anomaly channel is evolved rather than tuned. The holographic topological susceptibility feeds directly into the flow of the determinantal interaction. As a result, anomaly-induced flavor mixing weakens as deconfinement sets in. This behavior drives the chiral condensate and the Polyakov loop toward a self-dual fixed point. At this point their renormalizations coincide, their residual mixing vanishes, and a unified order parameter controls criticality. The theory is anchored to continuum-extrapolated lattice thermodynamics and conserved-charge fluctuations at vanishing baryon density. This anchoring is implemented through a lattice-calibrated Polyakov sector. The framework respects exact thermodynamic identities by enforcing stationarity at each scale. It also recovers the ideal-gas limit at high temperature and the Goldstone limit at low temperature. Solving the coupled Dyson-Schwinger, renormalization-group, and holographic equations yields the critical end point as an output rather than an assumption. The critical end point appears at temperatures around one hundred forty megaelectronvolts and baryon chemical potentials of a few hundred megaelectronvolts. The theory predicts a small positive curvature of the crossover line near zero density."

    "abstract": "Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials, defined by $ | Re(ε) | < 1$, enable unique light propagation characteristics, including confinement within sub-wavelength regions. To reduce losses in this regime, materials with both near-zero permittivity and $n<1$ refractive index, known as near-zero-index (NZI) materials, are desired. When both conditions are satisfied, the resulting region is classified as a low-loss ENZ medium combining strong light confinement with reduced optical losses. To achieve this behavior in the mid-IR, heavily doped semiconductors are required, and those compatible with current technologies are most desirable. This work provides the first in-depth study, supported by experimental demonstrations, of the plasmonic properties of highly doped GaN thin films on Si, exhibiting low optical losses and low-loss ENZ characteristics up to $3μm$. From the extracted optical parameters, the ENZ and NZI regions are determined and compared with the existing literature. As a result of the large polar character of nitrides, a hybridization of the surface plasmon and phonon polaritons is observed, accompanied by a flat-dispersion of the high-energy mode (pinned near the plasma frequency) indicative of its ENZ character. Establishing GaN as a viable platform for mid-IR ENZ-based plasmonics paves the way for integration into future infrared photonic technologies."

Our model grid spans $2-15\\,M_\\odot$ in mass and [Fe/H] $= -0.95$-$0.17$ ($Z = 0.0015$-$0.0200$) in metallicity, with four convective overshoot prescriptions. Strange modes were identified in a relatively small fraction ($5-12.5$ %) of models, occurring at $n_\\mathrm{pg} = 5-9$, with $n_\\mathrm{pg} = 6$-$7$ as the most frequent radial modes. No unstable solutions were identified beyond $n_\\mathrm{pg} = 9$, in contrast to earlier studies reporting strange modes at $n_\\mathrm{pg} = 10-12$. We quantified the duration of the instability crossing phase ($τ_\\mathrm{IS}$), the strange mode phase ($τ_\\mathrm{s}$), and their ratio $\\mathcal{P}_\\mathrm{s} = τ_\\mathrm{s} / τ_\\mathrm{IS}$. Toward higher masses, both $τ_\\mathrm{IS}$ and $τ_\\mathrm{s}$ decrease, yet their ratio shows no systematic trend with mass in models that include convective core overshoot. The absolute timescales for strange modes remain short, typically $τ_\\mathrm{s} \\sim 10^{4.5}$-$10^{6}$ years, while $τ_\\mathrm{IS}$ is often an order of magnitude shorter, implying that these stars may spend a larger fraction of their life in the strange mode phase than in the instability strip itself. The extended duration of the strange mode phase may enhance the detectability of strange mode pulsators, provided that observational precision is sufficient to capture their low-amplitude variability. The predicted periods ($0.6-6.3$ days) are well covered by a single $27-$day TESS sector, making strange mode pulsators potentially detectable with current space-based photometry, although blending with nearby sources may pose challenges."

    "abstract": "This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results."

These effects are particularly difficult to simulate because they require accurately capturing the interplay between sintering kinetics, viscous deformation, and macroscopic anisotropy. In this study, a robust and predictive model is established experimentally using anisotropic sintering dilatometry combined with overhang-deformation calibration through finite element simulations (FEM). The sintering behavior is identified using a porosity-temperature-independent minimization strategy applied to multi-rate dilatometry. Pellet anisotropy is incorporated via FEM by imposing directional sintering stresses. The deformation behavior is then calibrated by adjusting the shear viscosity to match overhang shapes deformation. The resulting model is finally validated on overhanging bar geometries. This step-by-step approach provides a comprehensive assessment of porcelain sintering while accurately capturing deformation mechanisms."

We focus on the practical realization of this iterative approach, leveraging sum-factorization and explicit SIMD vectorization to minimize memory footprint and maximize arithmetic throughput. The performance analysis demonstrates that the solver effectively hides data-fetching latencies and maintains optimal $\\mathcal{O}(p^d)$ memory scaling, even when dominated by geometric data on distorted meshes. The result is a robust smoother that rivals the execution speed of simple pointwise smoothers while preserving the convergence benefits of patch-based methods."

    "abstract": "Much like small ripples in a stream, which get lost in the larger waves, small changes in retail prices often fly under the radar of public perceptions, while large price changes appear as marketing moves associated with demand and competition. Unnoticed, these could increase consumers out of pocket expenses. Indeed, retailers could boost their profits by making numerous small price increases or by obfuscating large price increases with numerous small price decreases, thereby bypassing the consumers full attention and consideration, and triggering consumer fairness concerns. Yet only a handful of papers study small price changes. Extant results are often based on a single retailer, limited products, short time span, and legacy datasets dating back to the 1980s and 1990s, leaving their current practical relevance questionable. Researchers have also questioned whether the reported observations of small price changes are artifacts of measurement errors driven by data aggregation. In a series of analyses of a large dataset containing almost 79 billion weekly price observations from 2006 to 2015, covering 527 products, and about 35,000 stores across 161 retailers, we find robust evidence of asymmetric pricing in the small, where small price increases outnumber small price decreases, but no such asymmetry is present in the large. We also document the reverse phenomenon, where small price decreases outnumber small price increases. Our results are robust to several possible measurement issues. Importantly, our findings indicate a greater current relevance and generalizability of such asymmetric pricing practices than the existing literature recognizes."

While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset."

    "abstract": "Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) requires fast and accurate decoding of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) syndromes. However, in large-scale systems, the number of available decoders is much smaller than the number of logical qubits, leading to a fundamental resource shortage. To address this limitation, Virtualized Quantum Decoder (VQD) architectures have been proposed to share a limited pool of decoders across multiple qubits. While the Minimize Longest Undecoded Sequence (MLS) heuristic has been introduced as an effective scheduling policy within the VQD framework, its locally greedy decision-making structure limits its ability to consider global circuit structure, causing inefficiencies in resource balancing and limited scalability. In this work, we propose Constraint-Optimal Driven Allocation (CODA), an optimization-based scheduling algorithm that leverages global circuit structure to minimize the longest undecoded sequence length. Across 19 benchmark circuits, CODA achieves an average 74\\% reduction in the longest undecoded sequence length. Crucially, while the theoretical search space scales exponentially with circuit size, CODA effectively bypasses this combinatorial explosion. Our evaluation confirms that the scheduling time scales linearly with the number of qubits, determined by physical resource constraints rather than the combinatorial search space, ensuring robust scalability for large-scale FTQC systems. These results demonstrate that CODA provides a global optimization-based, scalable scheduling solution that enables efficient decoder virtualization in large-scale FTQC systems."

    "abstract": "This work focuses on the development of efficient solvers for the pseudo-stress formulation of the unsteady Stokes problem, discretised by means of a discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal grids (PolyDG). The introduction of the pseudo-stress variable is motivated by the growing interest in non-Newtonian flow models and coupled interface problems, where the stress field plays a fundamental role in the physical description. The space-time discretisation of the problem is obtained by combining the PolyDG approach in space with the implicit Euler method for time integration. The resulting linear system, characterised by a symmetric, positive, definite matrix, exhibits deteriorating convergence with standard solvers as the time step decreases. To address this issue, we investigate two tailored strategies: deflated Conjugate Gradient, which mitigates the effect of the most problematic eigenmodes, and collective Block-Jacobi, which exploits the block structure of the system matrix. Numerical experiments show that both approaches yield iteration counts effectively independent of $Δt$, ensuring robust performance with respect to the time step. Future work will focus on extending this robustness to the spatial discretisation parameter $h$ by integrating multigrid strategies with the time-robust solvers developed in this study."

Successful tuning of SOC in graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures by applying mechanical pressure and electric fields was also demonstrated in previous studies. In addition, theoretical calculations predicted a strong dependence of the proximity-induced SOC on the twist angle between graphene and TMDC. Here, we put these predictions to experimental test in ML-G/ML-WSe$_{2}$/hBN-heterostructures, where the twist angle is determined by aligning fractured edges, and by crystallographic etching of graphene. By performing weak anti-localization measurements, we determine the strength of the Rasbha-type SOC ($λ_\\mathrm{R}$) and the valley-Zeeman-type SOC ($λ_\\mathrm{VZ}$). Our experiments confirm a strong twist angle dependence of the proximity-induced SOC in agreement with theoretical predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the tunability of the SOC strength via mechanical pressure, which is in agreement with earlier findings."

However, real-world systems (e.g., electoral processes) frequently involve asymmetric boundaries. In this study, we explore how arbitrarily placed boundary conditions influence the mean first passage time in the symmetric noisy voter model, and how individualistic behavior amplifies this asymmetry. We derive exact analytical expressions for mean first passage time that accommodate any initial condition and two types of boundary configurations: (i) both boundaries absorbing, and (ii) one absorbing and one reflective. In both scenarios, mean first passage time exhibits a clear asymmetry with respect to the initial condition, shaped by the boundary placement and the rate of independent transitions. Symmetry in mean first passage time emerges only when absorbing boundaries are equidistant from the midpoint. Additionally, we show that Kramers' law holds in both configurations when the rate of independent transitions is large. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, reinforcing the robustness of our findings."

    "abstract": "Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms."

    "abstract": "In solid-state nanopores, achieving reliable control over pore aperture opening and closing (gating) remains a major challenge. Gating can be driven by the applied voltage involving electrically tunable chemical reactions, achieved by selecting appropriate compounds within the nanopore volume. In particular, cyclic precipitation and dissolution of metal phosphates can be triggered by regulating cation transport through an applied transmembrane voltage, thereby enabling reversible pore gating. Under negative bias, metal phosphate precipitates form inside the pore, obstructing ion flow and reducing current. Switching the polarity dissolves the precipitates, restoring ionic conductance. This process effectively produces a nanofluidic diode characterized by a remarkably high rectification ratio. To probe these localized chemical reactions more directly, we employed a plasmonic nanopore that generates strong confined fields, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements within the nanopore volume during cyclic gating. These measurements not only validate the proposed in-pore chemistry but also highlight the potential of plasmonic nanopores as powerful tools for monitoring nanoscale chemical processes with high spatial resolution."

    "abstract": "Inverse problems arise across scientific and engineering domains, where the goal is to infer hidden parameters or physical fields from indirect and noisy observations. Classical approaches, such as variational regularization and Bayesian inference, provide well established theoretical foundations for handling ill posedness. However, these methods often become computationally restrictive in high dimensional settings or when the forward model is governed by complex physics. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising framework for solving inverse problems by embedding physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on the Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Network (BPINN) framework, extending classical PINNs by explicitly incorporating training data generation, modeling and measurement uncertainties through Bayesian prior modeling and doing inference with the posterior laws. Also, as we focus on the inverse problems, we call this method BPINN-IP, and we show that the standard PINN formulation naturally appears as its special case corresponding to the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate. This unified formulation allows simultaneous exploitation of physical constraints, prior knowledge, and data-driven inference, while enabling uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we consider inverse problems arising in infrared image processing, including deconvolution and super-resolution, and present results on both simulated and real industrial data."

    "abstract": "Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness."

    "abstract": "Spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) are promising candidates for low-power spin-based electronics, yet existing realizations that rely on spin-orbit coupling are constrained by limited material choices and short spin-coherence lengths. Here we propose a different operating principle based on multiferroic altermagnets, in which spin splitting is tuned by an electric field through symmetry control rather than conventional spin-orbit physics. Using an effective model combined with quantum transport simulations, we show that the conductance is determined by the degree of matching between the electrically controlled spin texture of the channel and the fixed spin polarization of ferromagnetic contacts, enabling clear ON and OFF states. Remarkably, we also address a long-standing challenge in multiferroic device design: spintronic channels require metallic carriers, whereas ferroelectricity is usually suppressed in metals. We resolve this conflict by imprinting multiferroic altermagnetism into highly conductive materials via the proximity effect. First-principles calculations for graphene on multiferroic vanadium sulfide halides confirm that graphene acquires a ferroelectrically switchable spin splitting while retaining its metallic character. These results establish a practical route to SFET implementation and identify multiferroic altermagnets as a versatile platform for next-generation spintronic devices."

We present PruningAMR, an algorithm that builds a mesh with resolution adapted to geometric features encoded by the INR. To identify these geometric features, we use an interpolative decomposition pruning method on the weight matrices of the INR. The resulting pruned network is used to guide adaptive mesh refinement, enabling automatic mesh generation tailored to the underlying resolution of the function. Starting from a pre-trained INR--without access to its training data--we produce a variable resolution visualization with substantial memory savings."

After coherent transfer to the rovibrational ground state, these dimers can realize stable dipolar gases with strong, tunable long-range interactions. Here, we report the creation of bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{41}$K Feshbach molecules by radio-frequency (RF) association. An RF pulse applied on the molecular side of an interspecies Feshbach resonance at 73.6(1)~G associates up to $1.1(1)\\times10^4$ molecules from a thermal mixture of $^{23}$Na and $^{41}$K atoms. Measurements of the binding energy reveal a broad resonance width of 5.1(2)~G, facilitating robust control over interspecies interactions. The molecule lifetime in the presence of background atoms exceeds 2~ms, extending to 7~ms after removal of $^{23}$Na. These results constitute a key step toward the production of ultracold $^{23}$Na$^{41}$K ground state molecules for the exploration of novel many-body phenomena in strongly dipolar Bose gases."

We establish the relation with Hyodo-Kato cohomology of the special fiber and de Rham cohomology of the generic fiber. We also introduce overconvergent variants with and without support by restricting to open smooth formal subschemes.

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts."

Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment. MindGPT-4ov provides a general post-training paradigm applicable to a wide range of MLLMs. The model weights, datasets, and code for the Qwen3-VL-based variants will be recently open-sourced to support the community's development of MLLMs."

Often included as co-processors, they are used to accelerate compute-intensive workloads like loops. The speedup obtained is defined by the hardware design of the accelerator and by the quality of the compilation. State of the art (SoA) compilation techniques leverage modulo scheduling to minimize the Iteration Interval (II), exploit the architecture parallelism and, consequentially, reduce the execution time of the accelerated workload. In our work, we focus on improving the compilation process by finding the lowest II for any given topology, through a satisfiability (SAT) formulation of the mapping problem. We introduce a novel schedule, called Kernel Mobility Schedule, to encode all the possible mappings for a given Data Flow Graph (DFG) and for a given II. The schedule is used together with the CGRA architectural information to generate all the constraints necessary to find a valid mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only reduces compilation time on average but also achieves higher quality mappings compared to existing SoA techniques."

    "abstract": "The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is the accumulated light emitted throughout the history of the universe, spanning the UV, optical, and IR spectral ranges. Stars and dust in galaxies are expected to be the main source of the EBL. However, recent direct measurements performed beyond Pluto's orbit (less affected by foregrounds than those performed from the Earth) hint at an EBL level in the optical band larger than the one expected from the integrated contribution of known galaxy populations. One approach that could solve this controversy uses Very High Energy (VHE) photons coming from sources at cosmological distances. These photons can interact with the EBL producing electron-positron pairs, a process that leaves an imprint on the observed VHE spectrum. This technique, however, requires assumptions on the intrinsic spectrum of the source, which can compromise the robustness of EBL constraints. In this contribution, we used Monte Carlo simulations and archival data of the MAGIC telescopes to study the impact that the assumptions adopted in the literature have on the estimate of the EBL density, and how using more generic ones would modify the results. Our results show how the EBL density constraints obtained highly depend on the intrinsic spectral shape assumed for the source. We have studied two different methods to reduce the assumptions on the intrinsic spectral shape to get more robust results. This will be especially important for upcoming with new VHE facilities, where systematic uncertainties are expected to play a more significant role compared to statistical ones."

The acceleration that a CGRA can ultimately provide, however, heavily depends on the quality of the mapping, i.e. on how effectively the loop is compiled onto the given platform. State of the Art compilation techniques achieve mapping through modulo scheduling, a strategy which attempts to minimize the II (Iteration Interval) needed to execute a loop, and they do so usually through well known graph algorithms, such as Max-Clique Enumeration. We address the mapping problem through a SAT formulation, instead, and thus explore the solution space more effectively than current SoA tools. To formulate the SAT problem, we introduce an ad-hoc schedule called the \\textit{kernel mobility schedule} (KMS), which we use in conjunction with the data-flow graph and the architectural information of the CGRA in order to create a set of boolean statements that describe all constraints to be obeyed by the mapping for a given II. We then let the SAT solver efficiently navigate this complex space. As in other SoA techniques, the process is iterative: if a valid mapping does not exist for the given II, the II is increased and a new KMS and set of constraints is generated and solved. Our experimental results show that SAT-MapIt obtains better results compared to SoA alternatives in $47.72\\%$ of the benchmarks explored: sometimes finding a lower II, and others even finding a valid mapping when none could previously be found."

    "abstract": "Probabilistic seismic inverse modeling often requires the prediction of both spatially correlated geological heterogeneities (e.g., facies) and continuous parameters (e.g., rock and elastic properties). Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an efficient training-image-based simulation framework capable of reproducing complex geological models with high accuracy and comparably low generative cost. However, their application in stochastic geophysical inversion for multivariate property prediction is limited, as representing multiple coupled properties requires large and unstable networks with high memory and training demands. A more recent variant of GANs with spatially adaptive denormalization (SPADE-GAN) enables the direct conditioning of facies spatial distributions on local probability maps. Leveraging on such features, an iterative geostatistical inversion algorithm is proposed, SPADE-GANInv, integrating a pre-trained SPADE-GAN with geostatistical simulation, for the prediction of facies and multiple correlated continuous properties from seismic data. The SPADE-GAN is trained to reproduce realistic facies geometries, while sequential stochastic co-simulation predicts the spatial variability of the facies-dependent continuous properties. At each iteration, a set of subsurface realizations is generated and used to compute synthetic seismic data. The realizations providing the highest similarity coefficient to the observed data are used to update the subsurface probability models in the next iteration. The method is demonstrated on both 2-D synthetic scenarios and field data, targeting the prediction of facies, porosity, and acoustic impedance from full-stack seismic data. Results show that the algorithm enables accurate multivariate prediction, mitigates the impact of biased prior data, and accommodates additional local conditioning such as well logs."

Although TCRs provide abstractions for network and storage I/O, naive use often underutilizes GPU and I/O bandwidth due to insufficient overlap between computation and data movement. As a core contribution, we present PystachIO, a PyTorch-based distributed OLAP engine that combines fast network and storage I/O with key optimizations to maximize GPU, network, and storage utilization. Our evaluation shows up to 3x end-to-end speedups over existing distributed GPU-based query processing approaches."

    "abstract": "As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, manual configuration becomes increasingly inefficient and prone to human error. While intent-driven self-configuration using large language models has shown significant promise, such models remain computationally expensive, resource-intensive, and often raise privacy concerns because they typically rely on external cloud infrastructure. This work introduces SLM_netconfig, a fine-tuned small language model framework that uses an agent-based architecture and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to translate configuration intents expressed as natural language requirements or questions into syntactically and semantically valid network configurations. The system is trained on a domain-specific dataset generated through a pipeline derived from vendor documentation, ensuring strong alignment with real-world configuration practices. Extensive evaluation shows that SLM_netconfig, when using its question-to-configuration model, achieves higher syntactic accuracy and goal accuracy than LLM-NetCFG while substantially reducing translation latency and producing concise, interpretable configurations. These results demonstrate that fine-tuned small language models, as implemented in SLM_netconfig, can deliver efficient, accurate, and privacy-preserving automated configuration generation entirely on-premise, making them a practical and scalable solution for modern autonomous network configuration."

    "abstract": "In decentralized federated learning (DFL), the presence of abnormal clients, often caused by noisy or poisoned data, can significantly disrupt the learning process and degrade the overall robustness of the model. Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the aDFL method."

The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection."

We argue that the preprint misinterprets the purpose of Brazil's affirmative action policy, which is intended to ensure equitable access rather than equalize academic performance at the point of university entry. Early performance differences among universal system, public school, and racial-quota students reflect longstanding inequalities in Brazil's basic education system. Furthermore, the preprint generalizes findings basically from only three undergraduate programs (Physics, Biology, and Pedagogy) to represent entire academic domains (STEM, Biological Sciences, and Humanities), an extrapolation that reduces the reliability of its conclusions. Overall, we contend that early performance differences indicate structural educational inequality, not policy failure. Affirmative action fulfills its mandate by guaranteeing access, while universities bear the responsibility for providing equitable conditions for academic progression."

While quantum theory predicts the existence of macroscopic superpositions, their apparent absence in the everyday world is attributed either to environmental decoherence or to an intrinsic mechanism for wave-function collapse. This work presents a quantitative and experimentally grounded framework for distinguishing these possibilities. We propose a levitated optomechanical platform capable of generating controllable Schrodinger-cat states in the center of mass motion of a dielectric nanosphere. A comprehensive master equation incorporates gas collisions, black-body radiation, and photon-recoil noise, establishing a calibrated environmental baseline. The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model is embedded within the same framework, predicting a characteristic saturation of the decoherence rate with superposition size and a quadratic scaling with mass. A Bayesian inference protocol is outlined to discriminate collapse induced excess decoherence from environmental noise. Together these elements provide a concrete experimental blueprint for a decisive test of quantum linearity, either revealing new physics beyond standard quantum mechanics or setting the most stringent bounds to date on objective-collapse parameters."

We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

    "abstract": "Explainer videos are increasingly used to support science learning. While prior research has demonstrated their potential, studies have also identified limitations - particularly their tendency to foster an illusion of understanding, where learners overestimate their grasp of a topic despite gaps in their actual knowledge. Pairing explainer videos with cognitively engaging elements may help mitigate this effect. This paper reports two experimental studies examining the immediate and long-term effects of learning tasks following a physics explainer video on learners' illusion of understanding. Study 1 (N = 244 learners) compared high-level learning tasks with watching the video alone. Study 2 (N = 175) compared high-level and low-level tasks. Results show that high-level learning tasks significantly reduce the illusion of understanding immediately after the intervention compared to watching the video alone (t(88) = 6.50, p < .001, d = 0.69). Over the long term, both high-and low-level tasks are similarly effective. Learners with lower prior content knowledge are more susceptible to an illusion of understanding. We conclude that explainer videos should not be used in isolation in science classrooms. To prevent misjudged understanding - particularly among students with limited prior knowledge - they should be combined with cognitively demanding follow-up activities."

The obtained scaling laws and dependence on materials properties and temperature suggest effective pathways of interaction control. Scenarios of materials combinations are envisioned where the Phononic Casimir effect is of similar order as the standard Casimir interaction mediated by electromagnetic fluctuations."

This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining."

    "abstract": "The Gibbons-Werner (GW) method provides a geometric framework for calculating the deflection angle of particles in curved spacetimes, and numerous extensions based on the original version have been developed in recent years to expand its applicability. Most existing studies, however, are restricted to unbound orbits. The finite-distance deflection angle, which assumes both the source and observer to be located at finite distances, motivates us to investigate the bending of bound orbits. In this work, we broaden the GW method to bound orbits of massive particles in stationary axisymmetric (SAS) spacetimes, following our previous extension in static spherically symmetric (SSS) backgrounds [Huang et al., Phys. Rev. D 107, 104046 (2023)]. By employing our generalized GW method for SAS spacetimes [Huang et al., J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01(2024)013], (a) We obtain a formula for the deflection angle of bound massive particles in SAS spacetimes by dividing bound orbits that azimuthally overlap with themselves into multiple non-overlapping segments. This division enables the application of the GW method -- originally developed for unbound orbits -- to each segment in a consistent manner. (b) We overcome the limitation associated with the loss of positive definiteness of the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler (JMRF) metric, which occurs because bound massive particles have energies below unity. To show the practical implementation of our approach, we carry out the calculation in Kerr spacetime and obtain the deflection angle between two arbitrary points along the bound orbit of massive particles."

Here, we theoretically study the quantum dynamics of an exciton embedded in an asymmetric vertical cavity that favors emission in a specific polarization. We identify the configuration for optimal state initialization and demonstrate a path toward near-unity polarized efficiency. We also derive simple analytical formulas for the photon output in each polarization as a function of the Purcell-enhanced emission rates, which shed light on the physical mechanism behind our results."

Quality diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithms offer a promising approach to harness this potential, yet their success hinges on appropriate sonic feature representations.

This work investigates unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods for automatically defining and dynamically reconfiguring sonic behaviour spaces during QD search. We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and autoencoders to project high-dimensional audio features onto structured grids for MAP-Elites, implementing dynamic reconfiguration through model retraining at regular intervals. Comparison across two experimental scenarios shows that automatic approaches achieve significantly greater diversity than handcrafted behaviour spaces while avoiding expert-imposed biases. Dynamic behaviour-space reconfiguration maintains evolutionary pressure and prevents stagnation, with PCA proving most effective among the dimensionality reduction techniques. These results contribute to automated sonic discovery systems capable of exploring vast parameter spaces without manual intervention or supervised training constraints."

Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPM) confirm the coexistence of T-H polytype heterostructures. Atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements reveal the transparent effect in 1H/1T vertical heterostructures, where the charge density wave (CDW) of the underlying 1T-layer superposes on the top 1H-layer under positive bias. By systematically comparing 1T/1H and 1T/1T interfaces, we demonstrate that the metallic 1H-layer imposes a Coulomb screening effect on the 1T-layer, suppressing the formation of CDW domain walls and forming more ordered electronic states.

Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and baseline implementation at: https://github.com/oneal2000/UniFact/"

    "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing, yet reconstruction is often challenged by noise, undersampling, and complex scattering scenarios. Conventional methods, including matched filtering and sparsity-based compressed sensing, are limited in capturing intricate scene structures and frequently suffer from artifacts, elevated sidelobes, and loss of fine details. Recent diffusion models have demonstrated superior capability in representing high-order priors; however, existing diffusion-based SAR methods still yield degraded reconstructions due to oversimplified likelihood approximations in guided sampling. In this work, we propose a diffusion-driven split Gibbs sampling framework for SAR reconstruction, rigorously integrating measurement fidelity with learned diffusion priors. By alternately performing likelihood- and prior-driven updates via proximal sampling, this method ensures progressive convergence toward the true posterior while fully leveraging the expressive power of diffusion priors. Extensive experiments on simulated and Sentinel-1A datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements: over 7 dB average PSNR gain in simulations, along with significant sidelobe suppression (MPLSR +2.96 dB, MISLR +11.5 dB) with respect to the best baseline result. On real-world Sentinel-1A data, the method achieves an average PSNR gain of 1.6 dB while effectively reducing artifacts and preserving scene details, including ridges, edges, and fine textures. These results underscore the potential of the adapted framework as a robust and generalizable solution for high-fidelity SAR imaging across diverse sensing scenarios."

A central technical tool is a structural lemma that materializes part of the mutual information between two random variables, implicitly capturing the effect of infinitely many non-Shannon--type inequalities. This leads to conceptually transparent proofs without explicitly invoking such infinite families.

While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria."

    "abstract": "Fault-tolerant quantum computation traditionally incurs substantial resource overhead, with both qubit and time overheads scaling polylogarithmically with the size of the computation. While prior work by Gottesman showed that constant qubit overhead is achievable under stochastic noise using quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, it has remained an open question whether similar guarantees hold under more general, non-stochastic noise models. In this work, we address this question by considering a general circuit-level noise model defined via the diamond norm, which captures both stochastic and non-stochastic noise, including coherent and amplitude damping noise. We prove that constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable in this general setting, using QLDPC codes with constant rate and linear minimum distance. To establish our result, we develop a fault-tolerant error correction scheme and a method for implementing logic gates under general circuit noise. These results extend the theoretical foundations of fault-tolerant quantum computation and offer new directions for fault-tolerant architectures under realistic noise models."

To address this challenge, we demonstrate a highly sensitive nanothermometer using anti-Stokes photoluminescence, also known as photoluminescence upconversion (UPL), in monolayer tungsten disulfide ($\\mathrm{WS_2}$). Leveraging the direct band gap and strong exciton-phonon coupling in the two-dimensional monolayers, we achieve an exceptional relative sensitivity above $4\\%\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ across the 300 K to 425 K range, ranking it among the best-performing materials reported. A strong resonantly enhanced UPL is observed, confirming the central role of optical phonons in the upconversion mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a new analytical model to quantitatively describe the UPL process, taking into account the interplay of phonon populations, bandgap narrowing, and substrate effects, which predicts resonant temperatures and provides a framework with broad applicability to any material exhibiting an anti-Stokes photoluminescence response. To demonstrate its use as a high-resolution optical thermometer, we map a $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ thermal gradient across a $20\\,μ\\mathrm{m}$ long monolayer with a spatial resolution of $1\\,μ\\mathrm{m}$. With its high sensitivity, strong signal, and excellent reproducibility, our work establishes monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide as a leading platform for non-invasive thermal sensing in advanced microelectronic and biological systems."

This approach promises to democratize software development, but its educational implications remain underexplored. This paper reports on a one-day educational hackathon investigating how novice programmers and mixed-experience teams engage with vibe coding. We organized an inclusive event at a Brazilian public university with 31 undergraduate participants from computing and non-computing disciplines, divided into nine teams. Through observations, an exit survey, and semi-structured interviews, we examined creative processes, tool usage patterns, collaboration dynamics, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal that vibe coding enabled rapid prototyping and cross-disciplinary collaboration, with participants developing prompt engineering skills and delivering functional demonstrations within time constraints. However, we observed premature convergence in ideation, uneven code quality requiring rework, and limited engagement with core software engineering practices. Teams adopted sophisticated workflows combining multiple AI tools in pipeline configurations, with human judgment remaining essential for critical refinement. The short format (9 hours) proved effective for confidence-building among newcomers while accommodating participants with limited availability. We conclude that vibe coding hackathons can serve as valuable low-stakes learning environments when coupled with explicit scaffolds for divergent thinking, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and realistic expectations about production quality."

Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends."

However, unresolved inhomogeneities in the electron temperature can lead to a systematic underestimation of the abundances. We aim to directly test this effect. We use the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper to spatially map the physical conditions of the Trifid Nebula (M 20), a Galactic H II region ionized by a single mid-type O star, at 0.24 pc resolution. We exploit various emission lines (e.g., Hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited lines, including also faint auroral lines) and compute spatially resolved maps of [O II] and [S II] electron densities; [N II], [O II], [S II], [S III] electron temperatures; and the ionic oxygen abundances. We find internal variations of electron density that result from the ionization front, along with a negative radial gradient. However, we do not find strong gradients or structures in the electron temperature and the total oxygen abundance, making the Trifid Nebula a relatively homogeneous H II region at the observed spatial scale. We compare these spatially resolved properties with equivalent integrated measurements of the Trifid Nebula and find no significant variations between integrated and spatially resolved conditions. This isolated H II region, ionized by a single O-star, represents a test case of an ideal Strömgren sphere. The physical conditions in the Trifid Nebula behave as expected, with no significant differences between integrated and resolved measurements."

The proposed decomposition is used to design a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem with a fixed number of constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approximation scheme for such a general class of covering mixed-integer programs. Moreover, we design a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and an approximate linear programming formulation for the case with a single constraint. These results improve upon the previously best-known 2-approximation algorithm for the knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable. Finally, we show a perfect compact formulation for the case where all variables have the same lower and upper bounds. Analogous results are derived for the packing and assignment variants of the problem."

In particular, for tensor train (TT) models, it is unclear which TT-core should be treated in a Bayesian manner. We introduce a Bayesian tensor train kernel machine that applies Laplace approximation to estimate the posterior distribution over a selected TT-core and employs variational inference (VI) for precision hyperparameters. Experiments show that core selection is largely independent of TT-ranks and feature structure, and that VI replaces cross-validation while offering up to 65x faster training. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated on an inverse dynamics problem."

    "abstract": "The capacity to resist pathogens is recognized as a fundamental property of the immune system, yet it remains a phenomenological concept and lacks a defined physical basis, leaving its fundamental entity, definition, and quantification unresolved. Here, we address these questions by introducing a theoretical framework based on Lagrangian analytical mechanics, which recasts immune recognition as a dynamical system in an immunological state space. Generalized coordinates are used to describe the conformational states of immune receptors, and their evolution is governed by Euler-Lagrange equations constructed from the antigen-receptor interaction. Central to our theory is the identification of a continuous symmetry: the action remains invariant under specific translations within the antigenic structure space. From this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates a conserved quantity, I. We identify this conserved quantity as the physical embodiment of host immunity, a measurable quantity that encapsulates the system's protective capacity, encompassing both its breadth and intensity. This prediction is testable through statistically indistinguishable responses to antigen pairs related by the symmetry transformation. Furthermore, This theoretical model provides a unified framework for understanding key immunological phenomena, including vaccination, immune memory, tolerance, original antigenic sin, and T cell exhaustion. The conserved quantity I comprises a component quantifying protective breadth (with the dimension of action) and a component governing response intensity (with the dimension of energy), is thus established as a fundamental physical entity. This work transforms immune capacity from a phenomenological concept into a quantifiable entity, thereby establishing a foundational framework for predictive immunology and immunological intervention."

From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability."

Current methods can write formally fluent sentences but may be factually flawed, introducing serious medical errors known as clinical hallucinations, which make them untrustworthy for diagnosis. To bridge this gap, we introduce HiMed-RL, a Hierarchical Medical Reward Learning Framework designed to explicitly prioritize clinical quality. HiMed-RL moves beyond simple text matching by deconstructing reward learning into three synergistic levels: it first ensures linguistic fluency at the token-level, then enforces factual grounding at the concept-level by aligning key medical terms with expert knowledge, and finally assesses high-level diagnostic consistency at the semantic-level using a specialized LLM verifier. This hierarchical reward is implemented via a Human-inspired Dynamic Reward Adjustment, a strategy which first teaches the model to learn basic facts before progressing to more complex diagnostic reasoning. Experimentally, HiMed-3B achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, particularly on the latter, with an improvement of 12.1% over the second-best baseline. Our work provides a robust paradigm for generating reports that not only improve fluency but clinical fine-grained quality."

Detecting such a quantum Mpemba effect typically requires full knowledge of the quantum state during its time evolution, which is an experimentally challenging task since state tomography becomes exponentially difficult as system size increases. This poses a significant obstacle in studying Mpemba effect in complex many-body systems. In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by identifying suitable observables that signal rapid relaxation. Moreover, as long as the system equilibrates to a known unique steady-state, it is possible to fully detect the occurrence of quantum Mpemba effect just by measuring the observable for known state preparations. Our approach thus significantly reduces experimental complexity and offers a practical route for observing the quantum Mpemba effect in complex and extended multi-qubit setups."

For three stars we reconstructed the magnetic field topology and its temporal evolution via Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). Such reconstructions were then used to perform 3D MHD simulations of the stellar wind and environment impinging on the hosted exoplanets. We detected the magnetic field of six stars. Of these, we performed ZDI reconstructions for the first time of TOI-1860 and DS Tuc A, and for the second time of HD 63433, providing temporal information of its large-scale magnetic field. Consistently with previous results on young ($\\rm\\sim 50-100~Myr$) solar-like stars, the large-scale magnetic field is moderately strong (30-60 G on average) and complex, with a significant fraction of magnetic energy in the toroidal component and high-order poloidal components. We found the orbit of TOI-1860 b to be almost completely sub-Alfvénic, the orbits of DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 d to be trans-Alfvénic, and the orbits of HD 63433 b and c to be super-Alfvénic. We obtained marginal detections of the magnetic field for TOI-836 and TOI-2076, and detections for TOI-1136, but the number of observations is not sufficient for magnetic mapping. A magnetic star-planet connection can occur for most of TOI-1860 b's orbit. This can happen more sporadically for DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 c given the lower fraction of their orbit in the sub-Alfvénic regime. The orbit of HD 63433 c is nevertheless more sub-Alfvénic than previously simulated owing to the temporal evolution of the stellar magnetic field."

In this study, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the company's current development processes and practices, as well as the anticipated benefits and risks associated with the migration. Key stakeholders involved in software development participated in this evaluation to provide insight into their perceptions of the migration and their potential resistance to change. This paper describes the design of the interviews conducted with these stakeholders and presents an analysis of the results. Among the qualitative findings, we observed that all participants, regardless of their role in the development process, identified benefits of the migration relevant to their own activities.

Yet, QKD poses stringent requirements on the conditions of the network over which it is deployed. This work demonstrates the first quantum communication network in Cyprus via the deployment of a multi-node quantum network, exploiting existing commercial underground optical fibre. The network employs bidirectional occupation of fibres and wavelength multiplexing in a ring architecture to achieve, with minimal use of dark fibres, high-rate QKD. Results obtained reveal consistent key generation rates across all nodes, confirming reliable operation in a real-world environment.

Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality."

To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities."

    "abstract": "Nonequilibrium self-assembly is the root of all emergent complexity, including life. In quantum materials emergent metastable states have become a very fashionable topic of research, but the study of resulting mesoscopic state dynamics is hindered by the absence of appropriate methods. Here we pioneer the use of fast-scanning tunnelling microscope (FSTM) techniques to investigate the internal dynamics of mesoscopic metastable topologically non-trivial defects in an electronic Wigner crystal superlattice created by a local electromagnetic perturbation. This allows us to record unprecedented individual electron motion trajectories in real-time on the millisecond timescale. Such dynamics is understood to arise from coupling of hybridised Goldstone-Higgs bound states localised at the Y junction with microscopic electronic degrees of freedom that lead to the formation of localised quasiparticles with slow internal dynamics. Their unprecedented robustness against external perturbations comes from non-local constraints and non-trivial broken symmetries. Two-level system telegraph noise maps at the junction show phase and amplitude that is correlated with the observed electron motion trajectories. Such observation of single-particle dynamics in real time fundamentally transforms our understanding of metastable quantum states in electronic crystals and paves the way for technological advancements that make use of engineered topologically non-trivial defects."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available."

To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

The study utilizes the Ecosystem Vitality Index, a sub-dimension of the Environmental Performance Index. In addition, seven models were constructed to assess in detail the impact of economic growth on different dimensions of the ecosystem. The results show that economic growth has a significant impact in all models analyzed. However, the direction of this impact differs across ecosystem components. Economic growth is found to have a positive impact on agriculture and water resources. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP increases the agriculture and water resources indices by 0.074-0.672%. In contrast, economic growth has a negative impact on biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP reduces the indices of biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality by 0.101-2.144%. The results suggest that the environmental costs of economic growth processes need to be considered. Environmentally friendly policies should be combined with sustainable development strategies to reduce the negative impacts of economic growth."

Traditional cloud-based architectures struggle to handle the sheer volume and velocity of AI-driven data, leading to inefficiencies in storage, computation, and data movement. This paper explores the integration of active storage systems within the computing continuum to optimize AI workload distribution. By embedding computation directly into storage architectures, active storage is able to reduce data transfer overhead, enhancing performance and improving resource utilization. Other existing frameworks and architectures offer mechanisms to distribute certain AI processes across distributed environments; however, they lack the flexibility and adaptability that the continuum requires, both regarding the heterogeneity of devices and the rapid-changing algorithms and models being used by domain experts and researchers. This article proposes a software architecture aimed at seamlessly distributing AI workloads across the computing continuum, and presents its implementation using mainstream Python libraries and dataClay, an active storage platform. The evaluation shows the benefits and trade-offs regarding memory consumption, storage requirements, training times, and execution efficiency across different devices. Experimental results demonstrate that the process of offloading workloads through active storage significantly improves memory efficiency and training speeds while maintaining accuracy. Our findings highlight the potential of active storage to revolutionize AI workload management, making distributed AI deployments more scalable and resource-efficient with a very low entry barrier for domain experts and application developers."

    "abstract": "The cosmological distribution and formation rate of compact astrophysical objects such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are typically assumed to be proportional to a linear combination of cosmological star formation rate and stellar mass. In the literature, a template for star formation rate, which is just a function of redshift, is typically used. In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$. We show that cosmological population studies of FRBs have to include host galaxy information along with its redshift evolution in order to obtain unbiased results. This consideration is also applicable to other transients, e.g. gamma-ray bursts and merging binary black hole events. We show that our approach may open up the possibility to infer the host galaxy stellar mass of merging binary black holes with a detection of few thousand gravitational wave events."

To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research."

    "abstract": "The generation of high harmonics is a strongly nonlinear effect that allows to probe properties of the target and to study electron dynamics in matter. It has been investigated in many different kinds of targets, including molecular gases, liquids and solids. Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states."

We show that from a laminar set system we can obtain the corresponding laminar tree by means of a monadic second order logic (MSO) transduction. This resolves an open question originally asked by Courcelle and is a satisfying resolution as MSO is the natural logic for set systems and is sufficient to define the property ``laminar''. Using results from Campbell et al. [STACS 2025], we can now obtain transductions for obtaining modular decompositions, co-trees, split decompositions and bi-join decompositions using MSO instead of CMSO. We further gain some insight into the expressive power of counting quantifiers and provide some results towards determining when counting quantifiers can be simulated in MSO in laminar set systems and when they cannot."

While moiré superlattices provide access to Mott-Hubbard physics, their energy potential landscape and electronic correlations are highly sensitive to fluctuations of the twist angle, disorder and lattice reconstructions. However, fast and non-invasive experimental access to local twist angle and its spatial variations is challenging. Here, we systematically correlate twist angle variations of twisted WSe2 bilayers across micrometer length scales using a combined lateral force microscopy (LFM) and a micro- Raman spectroscopy approach. These measurements uncover lateral variations in the twist angle by more than 1° across length scales relevant to optical and transport measurements. We demonstrate that twist angles in the range of 3° < $α$ < 12° show distinct Raman response from scattering on optical moiré phonons allowing twist angle determination with high precision and sub-micrometer spatial resolution under ambient conditions. These modes are particularly sensitive in the low-angle twist regime, predicted to host emergent quantum phases. Our results establish micro-Raman spectroscopy of optical moiré phonons as a rapid, non-invasive probe to determine twist angle and to screen local twist angle variations with a precision better than $\\pm$ 0.3° and a lateral resolution below one micrometer.

We show that many basic properties of the classical GH-distance also hold in the continuous case. However, the continuous GH-distance, distinguishing between topologies, can differ significantly from the classical one. We will provide numerous examples of this distinction and demonstrate the role of topological dimension here. In particular, we will prove that the continuous GH-distance, like the classical one, is intrinsic, but, unlike the classical one, it is incomplete.

Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

Hetero-deformation-induced (HDI) hardening and strain de-localization are key to their strength-ductility synergy. However, existing models often fall short in addressing these aspects. In this work, a coupled framework integrating strain gradient crystal plasticity and phase field damage models is developed. The interface dominated HDI hardening in HS laminates is handled by introducing a heterogeneity coefficient into the back stress. The phase field model accounts for defect energy-driven damage and accurately represents the materials ductile damage behavior by accounting for effects of microstructure on crack initiation and propagation. Simulation results on HS laminates align well with experimental results and reflect the distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations and back stresses at interfaces between regions with dissimilar microstructure. Crack initiation and propagation are accurately described, providing valuable insights into fracture behavior. The model can predict how strength and ductility change upon variations of the HS laminate microstructure, thus providing an essential tool for microstructure optimization. This work enhances the understanding of deformation mechanisms in HS laminates and provides valuable insights for design and optimization of this class of materials."

    "abstract": "Several electrochemical and electrical energy storage devices are reported every day, with the claim of outperforming the established ones. The use of newer materials and recent advanced techniques to synthesize and/or assemble them into a device leads to improved performance. Cyclic stability of a device is the most effective way of assessing the performance of the device. A wide variety of parameters can influence the cyclic stability of a cell, and there is no single fundamental parameter that reliably captures or assesses its overall performance. Therefore, we developed a multi-dimensional assessment framework that could account for various parameters like various types of materials used, selected fabrication techniques, current density, operating voltage window, temperature, environment, and other conditions, and can effectively rank cell performance based on essential assessment metrics like specific capacity and energy density that are substantial for a well-founded comparison. The framework is designed with 45+ fields that capture various details related to i) materials used to fabricate cells, ii) processing techniques associated with electrode preparation and cell assembly, iii) cell information like weights and volumes, iv) electrochemical testing parameters, and v) cyclic charge-discharge performance details of a cell. The framework also accommodates charge-discharge gravimetric specific capacity, which is believed to be a key asset in accurately extracting lots of useful information, such as specific capacity, energy density, quantum efficiency, and other efficiencies. A distinctive feature of the framework is its ability to store data from both experimental and theoretical/computational sources (such as DFT and ML predictions) and facilitate effective comparison between them."

The desired control law, obtained using partial differential equations and backstepping control, contains an integral term that has to be approximated for implementation. In this article, we propose a new way to implement this control law using a dynamic controller. The control law is composed of a state feedback term and a dynamic term that approaches the integral term that has to be estimated for implementation. Using a Lyapunov functional, we provide sufficient conditions, in terms of a linear matrix inequality, to guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable when the proposed control law is applied. We use three examples, taken from the literature, to show the benefits of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has recently reported five Galactic microquasars as Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) $γ$-ray emitters (> 100 TeV). Among these sources, the microquasar V4641 Sgr exhibits $γ$-ray emission up to $\\sim$0.8 PeV, requiring the acceleration of particles to multi-PeV energies, as well as the hardest UHE spectrum. The mechanisms behind particle acceleration to such energies are not well understood. Furthermore, the limited multi-wavelength (MWL) information on this source appears contradictory, further complicating interpretation and suggesting that V4641 Sgr may represent a particularly unusual case. In this work, we present a detailed physical model of V4641 Sgr that combines first-principles simulations of stochastic (turbulent) particle acceleration with MWL emission modeling. We adopt a leptonic scenario in which electrons are accelerated via the second-order Fermi process driven by relativistic strong turbulence ($δB/B \\sim 1$). The particle energization is simulated using a dedicated Monte Carlo framework STRIPE that incorporates the effects of intermittent energy gains and radiative losses. The resulting accelerated electrons produce UHE $γ$-rays through inverse Compton scattering on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the interstellar radiation fields (ISRF). Our model is capable of reproducing key observational characteristics of the system, including particle acceleration to energies of tens of PeV, as well as the TeV-PeV $γ$-ray spectrum and the hard spectral index measured by LHAASO. Nonetheless, several aspects remain unresolved, highlighting the need for deeper observational coverage and further theoretical refinement."

While tools like GitHub Copilot are already in widespread use in interactive settings, automated approaches require a higher level of reliability before being usable in industrial practice. In this paper, we focus on three aspects that directly influence the quality of the results: a) the effect of automated feedback loops, b) the choice of Large Language Model (LLM), and c) the influence of behavior-preserving code changes. We study the effect of these three variables on an automated C-to-Rust translation system. Code translation from C to Rust is an attractive use case in industry due to Rust's safety guarantees. The translation system is based on a generate-and-check pattern, in which Rust code generated by the LLM is automatically checked for compilability and behavioral equivalence with the original C code. For negative checking results, the LLM is re-prompted in a feedback loop to repair its output. These checks also allow us to evaluate and compare the respective success rates of the translation system when varying the three variables. Our results show that without feedback loops LLM selection has a large effect on translation success. However, when the translation system uses feedback loops the differences across models diminish. We observe this for the average performance of the system as well as its robustness under code perturbations. Finally, we also identify that diversity provided by code perturbations can even result in improved system performance."

Yet, this design process is typically led by monodisciplinary approaches, often overlooking interdisciplinary knowledge and the experiential knowledge of workers who will ultimately share tasks with these systems. To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects. The framework emerges as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and a boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, guiding designers, empowering workers, and contributing to more just and collaborative futures of work."

To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks."

    "abstract": "Information gathering in large-scale or time-critical scenarios (e.g., environmental monitoring, search and rescue) requires broad coverage within limited time budgets, motivating the use of multi-agent systems. These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as \"intent\" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/marmotlab/AID."

Distinct from conventional input-output theory, our full-counting-statistics approach enables the direct calculation of arbitrary-order cumulants for the measured cumulative (i.e., time-integrated) photonic distribution while maintaining applicability to nonlinear systems. The corresponding Fisher information exhibits an exponential dependence on the squeezing parameter and a robustness against residual nonlinearity, which can even approach the quantum Fisher information, setting an upper limit. This work introduces a conceptually streamlined and computationally efficient framework for continuous quantum measurements, making it well suited for widespread adoption in quantum technologies."

    "abstract": "Although electric and magnetic fields are intrinsically coupled in random stationary light, a complete and physically consistent second-order description of polarization requires a joint electromagnetic treatment. The 6x6 electromagnetic polarization matrix introduced here generalizes the conventional electric 3x3 matrix by incorporating both electric and magnetic contributions together with their mutual correlations. It consists of diagonal 3x3 blocks, representing the electric and magnetic polarization matrices, and off-diagonal 3x3 blocks that encode the full structure of electric-magnetic cross-correlations. The information contained in this matrix can be interpreted through physically meaningful quantities such as active and reactive energy fluxes, in-phase and quadrature alignment matrices, and global indices describing electric-magnetic coupling. The formalism is applied to a field composed of two orthogonally propagating plane waves sharing a common linear electric polarization (a simple yet physically realizable configuration) that demonstrates the need for a general combined electric-magnetic representation even in free space. This approach provides a comprehensive and unified framework for characterizing electromagnetic polarization beyond the electric-field description alone, bridging classical statistical optics with quantum-like density-matrix interpretations."

To address these issues, we propose a generative feedback (i.e., reward model) framework that provides multi-dimensional language and audio feedback for SVS assessment. Our approach leverages an audio-language model to generate text and audio critiques-covering aspects such as melody, content, and auditory quality. The model is fine-tuned on a hybrid dataset combining human music reactions and synthetic critiques from a MLLMs, enhancing diversity and linguistic richness. Quantitative experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and training strategy, demonstrating that the framework produces musically accurate and interpretable evaluations suitable for guiding generative model improvement.

Here we show that this ``quantum jump photodetector'' (QJPD) approach can also detect photon-level signals embedded in strong sunlight. Using a single rubidium atom as a QJPD, we count arrivals of individual narrow-band laser photons embedded in sunlight powers of order $10^{10}$ photons/s. We derive a rate-equation model for the atom's internal-state dynamics in sunlight, and find quantitative agreement with experiment. Using this model, we calculate the channel capacity over a noisy communication channel when sending weak coherent states and detecting them in the presence of sunlight, achieving a representative rate of 0.5 bits per symbol when sending 150 probe photons per 10 ms time-bin, embedded in 1 nW of sunlight (of order $10^{10}$ photons/s in the visible and near-infrared bands). The demonstration may benefit background-limited applications such as daytime light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote magnetometry, and free-space classical and quantum optical communications."

The effect of Y-Yb exchange is found to be rather small despite the considerable difference in density and average atomic mass. For YAlO3 we find a moderate thermal conductivity anisotropy with weak temperature dependence and a ratio of c to b direction between at most 1 and 2.2. It is discussed with regard to the velocities of sound and relevant scattering processes. For YbAlO3 the small crystal size limits the precision of absolute thermal conductivity values and does not allow drawing conclusions on the anisotropy.

Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries.

Our framework establishes the connections between competing Choi formulations, develops the Kraus, Stinespring, and Liouville representations for superchannels, and provides a simplified derivation of the realization theorem that identifies the minimal memory required to implement a given transformation.

It is characterized by quantities such as surface tension, residual surface stress, and surface stiffness, however their analytical expressions are typically difficult to derive from atomistic data, and depend strongly on modeling choices. This work presents a neural network-based equation learner which combines customized activation functions and connection-based pruning to discover parsimonious, closed-form equations for surface elasticity from atomistic simulations. Applying the method to seven face centered cubic (FCC) metals, our equation learner uncovers interpretable equations that describe both low-Miller index and high-Miller index surface properties, capturing long-tail property distributions accurately. The discovered expressions are decoupled into two components: a universal, geometry-driven orientation function, and material-specific baseline coefficients. We find that lower-order properties such as surface tension are fundamentally geometry dependent, while higher-order properties such as surface stress and elasticity show more complex geometry and material dependence. We also relate material dependent coefficients to bulk properties, forming a clear map from bulk material properties to surface elasticity. Overall, this approach demonstrates that interpretable neurosymbolic machine learning can bridge the gap between atomistic simulations and physical laws, enabling the discovery of generalizable structure-property relationships for materials science phenomena such as surface elasticity."

    "abstract": "This paper develops new identification results for multidimensional continuous measurement-error models where all observed measurements are contaminated by potentially correlated errors and none provides an injective mapping of the latent distribution. Using third order cross moments, the paper constructs a three way tensor whose unique decomposition, guaranteed by Kruskal theorem, identifies the factor loading matrices. Starting with a linear structure, the paper recovers the full distribution of latent factors by constructing suitable measurements and applying scalar or multivariate versions of Kotlarski identity. As a result, the joint distribution of the latent vector and measurement errors is fully identified without requiring injective measurements, showing that multivariate latent structure can be recovered in broader settings than previously believed. Under injectivity, the paper also provides user-friendly testable conditions for identification. Finally, this paper provides general identification results for nonlinear models using a newly-defined generalized Kruskal rank - signal rank - of intergral operators. These results have wide applicability in empirical work involving noisy or indirect measurements, including factor models, survey data with reporting errors, mismeasured regressors in econometrics, and multidimensional latent-trait models in psychology and marketing, potentially enabling more robust estimation and interpretation when clean measurements are unavailable."

Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories."

The nanorods are placed on a 70 nm thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer, with a 50 nm thick gold (Au) reflective layer underneath. In contrast to conventional transmissive metalenses, our design accomplishes complete 2π phase control via geometry-optimized silicon nanorods, facilitating compact reflective optics.

Previous work has largely focused on predicting precursors or reaction conditions, but only rarely on full synthesis pathways. We introduce the ActionGraph, a directed acyclic graph framework that encodes both the chemical and procedural structure, in terms of synthesis operations, of inorganic synthesis reactions. Using 13,017 text-mined solid-state synthesis reactions from the Materials Project, we show that incorporating PCA-reduced ActionGraph adjacency matrices into a $k$-nearest neighbors retrieval model significantly improves synthesis pathway prediction. While the ActionGraph framework only results in a 1.34% and 2.76% increase in precursor and operation F1 scores (average over varying numbers of PCA components) respectively, the operation length matching accuracy rises 3.4 times (from 15.8% to 53.3%). We observe an interesting trade-off where precursor prediction performance peaks at 10-11 PCA components while operation prediction continues improving up to 30 components. This suggests composition information dominates precursor selection while structural information is critical for operation sequencing. Overall, the ActionGraph framework demonstrates strong potential, and with further adoption, its full range of benefits can be effectively realized."

Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry.

Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

These pseudocodewords are found to be dependent on the parity-check matrix of the code and the particular decoding algorithm used. In this paper, we consider LP decoding, which has been linked to graph cover decoding, providing functions which capture these pseudocodewords. In particular, we analyze the underlying structure of pseudocodewords from quantum stabilizer codes that arise from LP decoding, quasi-cyclic LDPC codes, and spatially-coupled LDPC codes."

In this framework, the coherent propagation of a quantum walker over a graph encodes its structural properties into state amplitudes, enabling the identification of highly influential vertices through their transition probabilities. To enhance stability and solution quality, we introduce a dynamic decoupling (``freezing'') mechanism that isolates vertices already selected for the cover, preventing their interference in subsequent iterations of the algorithm. The method employs a compact binary encoding, requiring only $\\lceil \\log_2 (V)\\rceil$ qubits to represent a graph with $V$ vertices, resulting in an exponential reduction of quantum resources compared to conventional vertex-based encodings. We benchmark the proposed heuristic against exact solutions obtained via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and against established classical heuristics, including Simulated Annealing, FastVC, and the 2-Approximation algorithm, across Erdős--Rényi, Barabási--Albert and regular random graph ensembles. Our results demonstrate that the CTQW-based heuristic consistently achieves superior approximation ratios and exhibits remarkable robustness with respect to network topology, outperforming classical approaches in both heterogeneous and homogeneous structures. These findings indicate that continuous-time quantum walks, when combined with topology-independent decoupling strategies, provide a powerful paradigm for large-scale combinatorial optimization and complex network control, with potential applications spanning infrastructure resilience, epidemic containment, sensor network optimization, and biological systems analysis."

Beyond a threshold quorum-sensing strength, we find long-lived transient states that retain memory of initial conditions, including kinetically arrested active gels. Although quorum sensing can mimic attractive interactions, it also acts strongly in dilute regions, producing an effective cluster bistability that is captured by our theory. Our results explain collective states observed experimentally in synthetic and biological active systems."

However, computing \\bd\\ is extremely difficult, especially on large graphs. In this paper, we focus on the problem of \\emph{single-pair} \\bd\\ query. Existing methods mainly rely on random walk-based approaches, which work well on some graphs but become inefficient when the random walk cannot mix rapidly.To overcome this issue, we first show that the biharmonic distance between two nodes $s,t$, denoted by $b(s,t)$, can be interpreted as the distance between two random walk distributions starting from $s$ and $t$. To estimate these distributions, the required random walk length is large when the underlying graph can be easily cut into smaller pieces. Inspired by this observation, we present novel formulas of \\bd to represent $b(s,t)$ by independent random walks within two node sets $\\mathcal{V}_s$, $\\mathcal{V}_t$ separated by a small \\emph{cut set} $\\mathcal{V}_{cut}$, where $\\mathcal{V}_s\\cup\\mathcal{V}_t\\cup\\mathcal{V}_{cut}=\\mathcal{V}$ is the set of graph nodes. Building upon this idea, we propose \\bindex, a novel index structure which follows a divide-and-conquer strategy. The graph is first cut into pieces so that each part can be processed easily. Then, all the required random walk probabilities can be deterministically computed in a bottom-top manner. When a query comes, only a small part of the index needs to be accessed. We prove that \\bindex\\ requires $O(n\\cdot h)$ space, can be built in $O(n\\cdot h\\cdot (h+d_{max}))$ time, and answers each query in $O(n\\cdot h)$ time, where $h$ is the height of a hierarchy partition tree and $d_{max}$ is the maximum degree, which are both usually much smaller than $n$."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process."

Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Typically, the yield stress behaviour is captured in the Herschel-Bulkley (HB) model, which assumes a constant yield stress as material parameter. It is not clear whether the simultaneous superposition of a flow in an orthogonal direction to the main flow, that displays HB behaviour, affects the yield stress and will make the yield stress either flow rate- or field-dependent. Therefore, it is important to understand how the presence of flow in two orthogonal directions affects the yielding behaviour of the fluid in general. In this work, we showed that wall patterning can be used to generate flow in two orthogonal directions simultaneously. We find that these orthogonal flows measurably affected each other. We induced spatially varying secondary flows by shearing a standard Newtonian fluid and two common yield stress fluids in a rheometer using a concentric cylinder geometry with angled ridges. We measured the normal force as a function of rotation rates for different angled ridges from conventional rheological measurements. We also imaged the flow fields by employing rheo-MRI, to directly measure the penetration depth of the fluids into the rough boundary of the ridged geometry. Finally, we relate the penetration depth to the axial flow for different geometries, at different imposed rotation rates and the fluid type, to show that two flow directions in the yield stress fluids are indeed significantly related to each other."

Here, we present a demonstration of a drop-casting based approach to introduce ultrafast plasmonic-mediated coupling: a sparse-layer of silica-gold core-shell nanoparticles is deposited directly onto a W/Fe/Pt spintronic trilayer. This sparse (six percent) decoration increases the wafer-averaged THz pulse energy, pointing to a very high local conversion enhancement for this low-coverage spintronic emitter compared with the bare stack.

    "abstract": "We theoretically investigate the spin structure and spin dynamics of excitons in bulk lead halide perovskite semiconductors with cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic crystal symmetry. The exciton spin structure and its modification by an external magnetic field are modeled for different regimes defined by the relative magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction (splitting between dark and bright states) and the Zeeman spin splitting. The effects of crystal symmetry and magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystal axes are considered for lead halide perovskite crystals with band gaps in the range 1.4 - 3.5 eV, having different ratios of electron and hole g-factors. For cubic symmetry, in a longitudinal magnetic field, our theory predicts quantum beats between the bright exciton states under linearly polarized excitation and detection, while the dark exciton remains optically inactive. In a transverse magnetic field, all exciton spin states become optically active and can be excited by circularly polarized light. Reduction of the crystal symmetry leads to a zero-field offset of the exciton Larmor precession frequencies, modifying the Zeeman splitting energy dependence on magnetic field. This theoretical framework allows for the extraction of the strength of the exchange interaction and the crystal symmetry. Experimentally, we measure the exciton spin coherence via time-resolved photoluminescence at a temperature of 1.6 K in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields in orthorhombic MAPbI3 crystals. Polarization beats at the frequency of the bright exciton are observed in both configurations. Comparison with theory indicates that the excitons are in the strong exchange interaction regime, and the reduction of symmetry does not lead to a significant splitting of the exciton spin levels."

While this model has become an archetype of economic conceptualization that combines bounded rationality and myopic reasoning, the literature on its asymptotic behaviours has remained scarce. In this paper, we proceed to a mathematical analysis of the dynamics and its full characterization in the simplest case of homogeneous buyer populations. By using elements of the theory of cooperative dynamical systems, we prove that, independently of the number of sellers and parameters, for almost every initial condition, the subsequent trajectory must asymptotically approach a stationary state. Moreover, for simple enough distributions of the sellers' attractiveness, we determine all stationary states and their parameter-dependent stability. This analysis shows that in most cases, the asymptotic preferences are ordered as the attractiveness are. However, depending on the parameters, there also exist robust functioning modes in which those sellers with highest preference are not the ones that provide highest profit."

    "abstract": "Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple sources of information."

    "abstract": "Stochastic Nonlinear Optimal Control (SNOC) seeks to minimize a cost function that accounts for random disturbances acting on a nonlinear dynamical system. Since the expectation over all disturbances is generally intractable, a common surrogate is the empirical cost, obtained by averaging over a finite dataset of sampled noise realizations. This substitution, however, introduces the challenge of guaranteeing performance under unseen disturbances. The issue is particularly severe when the dataset is limited, as the trained controllers may overfit, leading to substantial gaps between their empirical cost and the deployment cost. In this work, we develop a PAC-Bayesian framework that establishes rigorous generalization bounds for SNOC. Building on these bounds, we propose a principled controller design method that balances empirical performance and prior knowledge. To ensure tractability, we derive computationally efficient relaxations of the bounds and employ approximate inference methods. Our framework further leverages expressive neural controller parameterizations, guaranteeing closed-loop stability. Through simulated examples, we highlight how prior knowledge can be incorporated into control design and how more reliable controllers can be synthesized for cooperative robotics."

We investigate observational implications of the proposed HT scenario for PSR J1618-3921 and our ability to constrain the scenario. We model the MSP-Helium White Dwarf binary to be a part of bound point-mass HT, while incorporating the effects due to the quadrupolar interactions between the inner and outer binaries, along with dominant order general relativistic contributions to the periastron precession of the inner binary. If the proposed HT system is indeed undergoing Kozai oscillations at the present epoch, the orbital eccentricity ($e$) would be expected to decrease, while the rate of periastron advance ($\\dotω$) would correspondingly increase, for plausible ranges of the HT parameters. Furthermore, the fractional variations in $e$ are anticipated to be at the level of a few parts in $10^{5}$-a magnitude that is substantially larger than the current measurement precision of $e$. We find that, for this eccentric MSP binary, the HT configurations that minimize the temporal evolution of orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are mutually incompatible. This indicates that the continued high-precision timing of PSR J1618-3921-when analyzed within the framework introduced here-should place stringent limits on the presence and properties of a potential third body in the system."

Research suggests that transparency and interpretability of computational methods tend to increase human acceptance of using AI to support decisions. However, the extent to which humans accept AI judgments for deception detection remains unclear. We experimentally examined how an AI model's accuracy (i.e., its overall performance in deception detection) and confidence (i.e., the model's uncertainty in single-statements predictions) influence human adoption of the model's judgments. Participants (n=373) were presented with veracity judgments of an AI model with high or low overall accuracy and various degrees of prediction confidence. The results showed that humans followed predictions from a highly accurate model more than from a less accurate one. Interestingly, the more confident the model, the more people deviated from it, especially if the model predicted deception. We also found that human interaction with algorithmic predictions either worsened the machine's performance or was ineffective. While this human aversion to accept highly confident algorithmic predictions was partly explained by participants' tendency to overestimate humans' deception detection abilities, we also discuss how truth-default theory and the social costs of accusing someone of lying help explain the findings."

    "abstract": "The safe deployment of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) relies on comprehensive testing and evaluation. However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning is among the most popular and powerful approaches for self-supervised representation learning, where the goal is to map semantically similar samples close together while separating dissimilar ones in the latent space. Existing theoretical methods assume that downstream task classes are drawn from the same latent class distribution used during the pretraining phase. However, in real-world settings, downstream tasks may not only exhibit distributional shifts within the same label space but also introduce new or broader label spaces, leading to domain generalization challenges. In this work, we introduce novel generalization bounds that explicitly account for both types of mismatch: domain shift and domain generalization. Specifically, we analyze scenarios where downstream tasks either (i) draw classes from the same latent class space but with shifted distributions, or (ii) involve new label spaces beyond those seen during pretraining. Our analysis reveals how the performance of contrastively learned representations depends on the statistical discrepancy between pretraining and downstream distributions. This extended perspective allows us to derive provable guarantees on the performance of learned representations on average classification tasks involving class distributions outside the pretraining latent class set."

    "abstract": "Model-based filtering is often carried out while subject to an imperfect model, as learning partially-observable stochastic systems remains a challenge. Recent work on Bayesian inference found that tempering the likelihood or full posterior of an imperfect model can improve predictive accuracy, as measured by expected negative log likelihood. In this paper, we develop the tempered Bayes filter, improving estimation performance through both of the aforementioned, and one newly introduced, modalities. The result admits a recursive implementation with a computational complexity no higher than that of the original Bayes filter. Our analysis reveals that -- besides the well-known fact in the field of Bayesian inference that likelihood tempering affects the balance between prior and likelihood -- full-posterior tempering tunes the level of entropy in the final belief distribution. We further find that a region of the tempering space can be understood as interpolating between the Bayes- and MAP filters, recovering these as special cases. Analytical results further establish conditions under which a tempered Bayes filter achieves improved predictive performance. Specializing the results to the linear Gaussian case, we obtain the tempered Kalman filter. In this context, we interpret how the parameters affect the Kalman state estimate and covariance propagation. Empirical results confirm that our method consistently improves predictive accuracy over the Bayes filter baseline."

    "abstract": "Code-generating LLMs are trained largely on static artifacts (source, comments, specifications) and rarely on materializations of run-time behavior. As a result, they readily internalize buggy or mislabeled code. Since non-trivial semantic properties are undecidable in general, the only practical way to obtain ground-truth functionality is by dynamic observation of executions. In prior work, we addressed representation with Sequence Sheets, Stimulus-Response Matrices (SRMs), and Stimulus-Response Cubes (SRCs) to capture and compare behavior across tests, implementations, and contexts. These structures make observation data analyzable offline and reusable, but they do not by themselves provide persistence, evolution, or interactive analytics at scale. In this paper, therefore, we introduce observation lakehouses that operationalize continual SRCs: a tall, append-only observations table storing every actuation (stimulus, response, context) and SQL queries that materialize SRC slices on demand. Built on Apache Parquet + Iceberg + DuckDB, the lakehouse ingests data from controlled pipelines (LASSO) and CI pipelines (e.g., unit test executions), enabling n-version assessment, behavioral clustering, and consensus oracles without re-execution. On a 509-problem benchmark, we ingest $\\approx$8.6M observation rows ($<$51MiB) and reconstruct SRM/SRC views and clusters in $<$100ms on a laptop, demonstrating that continual behavior mining is practical without a distributed cluster of machines. This makes behavioral ground truth first-class alongside other run-time data and provides an infrastructure path toward behavior-aware evaluation and training.

The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks."

Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions. To address these limitations, CogDrive introduces a cognition driven multimodal prediction and planning framework that integrates explicit modal reasoning with safety aware trajectory optimization. The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios. By combining cognitive multimodal prediction with safety oriented planning, CogDrive offers an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic."

    "abstract": "Accelerated brain aging has been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia. Over the past decade, these findings have been replicated using the Brain Age paradigm, which applies machine learning techniques to estimate brain age from neuroimaging data. This approach yields a single index, the Brain Age Gap, defined as the difference between predicted and chronological age. Nevertheless, both the progressive nature of this phenomenon and the potential role of antipsychotic medication remain unclear. To investigate its progression, we compared the Brain Age Gap between individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis and healthy controls using ANCOVA, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and estimated total intracranial volume. To enhance the robustness of our findings, we employed two distinct models: a transformer-inspired model based on harmonized volumetric brain features extracted with FastSurfer, and a previously trained deep learning model. To assess the potential effect of medication, we further compared bipolar patients who received antipsychotic treatment with those who did not. Mann-Whitney U test consistently showed that medicated bipolar patients did not exhibit a significantly larger Brain Age Gap. Both models converge on the conclusion that accelerated brain aging is unlikely to be explained by antipsychotic medication alone. Longitudinal studies are therefore required to clarify the temporal dynamics of brain aging in schizophrenia."

In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model."

This yields an implicit stochastic-gradient update. We show that the popular class of explicit score-driven (ESD) models arises if the observation log density is linearly approximated around the prediction. By preserving the full density, the ISD update globalizes favorable local properties of the ESD update. Namely, for log-concave observation densities, whether correctly specified or not, the ISD filter is stable for all learning rates, while its updates are contractive in mean squared error toward the (pseudo-)true parameter at every time step. We demonstrate the usefulness of ISD filters in simulations and empirical illustrations in finance and macroeconomics."

Here, we report on the temperature evolution of angle-resolved photoemission spectra of the parent compound BaFe2As2, ranging from the AFO to nematic to paramagnetic phases. The Dirac cone feature, which is formed in the AFO phase, is found to persist in the nematic phase, suggesting that an antiferroic order of the same periodicity as the AFO phase persists in the nematic phase. Considering the relatively shallow d_xy orbital in BaFe2As2, we propose that an antiferro-orbital order involving the d_xy and other orbitals takes place in the nematic phase."

Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

This study proposes two preferential models to explore how news spreads on social media. Specifically, we examine global and local preferential selection models and demonstrate that information dissemination aligns with these patterns. According to these two models, information flows are distributed through specific paths on networks. This suggests that new information tends to propagate along the same paths as previous news, with the specific pathways varying depending on the type of content. Finally, an examination of the propagation of political hashtags on Twitter confirms the existence of these paths that also emerge from the two preferential models."

    "abstract": "In the face of accelerating global urbanization and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, highresolution urban rainfall monitoring is crucial for building resilient smart cities. Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication is widely acknowledged as a foundational technology for next-generation mobile networks. Compared with monostatic sensing, multi-access point (AP) collaborative sensing endows mobile networks with broader, more accurate, and resilient sensing capabilities, which are critical for diverse location-based sectors. This paper focuses on collaborative sensing in multi-AP networks and proposes a Bayesian probability fusion framework for target parameter estimation using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing waveform. The framework models multi-AP received signals as probability distributions to capture stochastic observations from channel noise and scattering coefficients. Prior information is then incorporated into the joint probability density function to cast the problem as a constrained maximum a posteriori estimation. To address the high-dimensional optimization, we develop a prior-constrained gradient ascent (PCGA) algorithm that decouples correlated parameters and performs efficient gradient updates guided by the target prior. Theoretical analysis covers optimal fusion weights for global signal-to-noise ratio maximization, PCGA convergence, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the estimator, with insights applicable to broader fusion schemes. Extensive numerical simulations and real-world experiments with commercial devices show the framework reduces transmission overhead by 90% versus signal fusion and lowers estimation error by 41% relative to parameter fusion. Notably, field tests achieve submeter accuracy with 50% probability in typical coverage of mmWave APs. These improvements highlight a favorable balance between communication efficiency and estimation accuracy for practical multi-AP sensing deployment.

In this paper we consider a class of such systems with both uncertain dynamics and an unknown but strictly positive input gain, where the nonlinear uncertainty is characterized by bounds on the Jacobian with respect to the state variables. We explicitly construct a three-dimensional region for the PID gains that is sufficient to guarantee global stability and asymptotic tracking of constant references for all nonlinearities satisfying these Jacobian bounds. We then derive a corresponding necessary region, thereby revealing the inherent conservatism required to cope with worst-case uncertainties. Moreover, under additional structural assumptions on the nonlinearities, these sufficient and necessary regions coincide, yielding a precise necessary-and-sufficient characterization of all globally stabilizing PID gains. All these regions are given in closed form and depend only on the prescribed Jacobian bounds and the known lower bound of the input gain, in contrast to many qualitative tuning methods in the literature."

    "abstract": "Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer."

Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16."

To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency."

By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches."

    "abstract": "The ''trace reconstruction'' problem asks, given an unknown binary string $x$ and a channel that repeatedly returns ''traces'' of $x$ with each bit randomly deleted with some probability $p$, how many traces are needed to recover $x$? There is an exponential gap between the best known upper and lower bounds for this problem. Many variants of the model have been introduced in hopes of motivating or revealing new approaches to narrow this gap. We study the variant of circular trace reconstruction introduced by Narayanan and Ren (ITCS 2021), in which traces undergo a random cyclic shift in addition to random deletions. We show an improved lower bound of $\\tildeΩ(n^5)$ for circular trace reconstruction. This contrasts with the (previously) best known lower bounds of $\\tildeΩ(n^3)$ in the circular case and $\\tildeΩ(n^{3/2})$ in the linear case. Our bound shows the indistinguishability of traces from two sparse strings $x,y$ that each have a constant number of nonzeros. Can this technique be extended significantly? How hard is it to reconstruct a sparse string $x$ under a cyclic deletion channel? We resolve these questions by showing, using Fourier techniques, that $\\tilde{O}(n^6)$ traces suffice for reconstructing any constant-sparse string in a circular deletion channel, in contrast to the upper bound of $\\exp(\\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}))$ for general strings in the circular deletion channel. This shows that new algorithms or new lower bounds must focus on non-constant-sparse strings."

It is prevalent in various physical and mechanical systems, such as yielding structures under seismic excitation, ferromagnetic materials, and piezoelectric actuators. Analytical models like the Bouc-Wen model are often employed but rely on idealized assumptions and careful parameter calibration, limiting their applicability to diverse or mechanism-unknown behaviors. Existing equation discovery approaches for hysteresis are often system-specific or rely on predefined model libraries, which limit their flexibility and ability to capture the hidden mechanisms. To address these, this research develops a unified framework that integrates learning of internal variables (commonly used in modeling hysteresis) and symbolic regression to automatically extract internal hysteretic variable, and discover explicit governing equations directly from data without predefined libraries as required by methods such as sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Solving the discovered equations naturally enables prediction of the dynamic responses of hysteretic systems. This work provides a systematic view and approach for both equation discovery and characterization of hysteretic dynamics, defining a unified framework for these types of problems."

    "abstract": "With increased travelling needs more than ever, traffic congestion has become a major concern in most urban areas. Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking."

    "abstract": "Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

    "abstract": "Agentic systems are modern software systems: they consist of orchestrated modules, expose interfaces, and are deployed in software pipelines. Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving. Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step. This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time. Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems. Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success. Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues. Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories."

For the $1$-dimensional Kloosterman family, Haessig[8] showed that there is a $p$-adic cohomology theory for the infinity symmetric power $L$-function.

In the conventional rib flow field, the oxygen transport is affected by the accumulation of under-rib liquid water which causes excessive concentration loss and limits cell performance. To improve the cell performance, a composite foam-rib flow field structure is proposed by combining the metal foam flow field and the conventional rib flow field. The proposed design is simulated by using a three-dimensional homogeneous non-isothermal numerical model. The results show that the composite foam-rib flow field, by improving the oxygen transfer and water removal capabilities under the ribs, can improve the oxygen concentration and current density without increasing the pumping power, thus improving the cell performance under different conditions. The key parameters of the composite foam-rib flow field are optimized. With the optimal metal foam filling ratio of 0.75 and porosity of 0.85, the peak power density and the limiting current density for the composite foam-rib flow field are higher than the conventional rib flow field by 5.20% and 22.68%."

We propose two complementary algorithms: the Causal Decoupling Algorithm, which exploits geometric disconnections in the light cone for sampling efficiency, and the Algebraic Decomposition Algorithm, which utilizes algebraic expansion to minimize hardware requirements. These methods allow simulation costs to depend on circuit depth and connectivity rather than system size. Together, our results generalize Lieb-Robinson-inspired locality to modular architectures and establish a quantitative framework for probing local physics on near-term quantum devices by decoupling the simulation cost from the global system size."

New jetting dynamics are expected in different conditions of droplet impact on super-hydrophobic surfaces, such as new jetting phenomena, mechanisms, and regimes. Experiments: In this experimental study of droplet impact on super-hydrophobic surfaces, the Weber number and the Ohnesorge number are varied in a wide range, and the impact process is analyzed theoretically. Findings: We identify a new type of singular jets, i.e., singular jets induced by horizontal inertia (HI singular jets), besides the previously studied singular jets induced by capillary deformation (CD singular jets). For CD singular jets, the formation of the cavity is due to the propagation of capillary waves on the droplet surface; while for HI singular jets, the cavity formation is due to the large horizontal inertia of the toroidal edge during the retraction of the droplet after the maximum spreading. Key steps of the impact process are analyzed quantitatively, including the spreading of the droplet, the formation and the collapse of the spire, the formation and retraction of the cavity, and finally the formation of singular jets. A regime map for the formation of singular jets is obtained, and scaling relationships for the transition conditions between different regimes are analyzed."

The measured effective mass correlates with the mass of atoms participating in interface migration. Using this advance, we reassess prevailing theories and identify regimes where the inertial term materially affects interfacial kinetics, particularly at high frequencies relevant to thermal fluctuations. These results motivate incorporating an effective mass into kinetic descriptions, providing a clearer basis for modeling and interpreting interface migration."

Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization."

    "abstract": "Detecting Earth twins remains challenging because their shallow, long-period transits are difficult to distinguish from background noise. Motivated by the challenge, we developed Segmented-Polynomial-fitting Least Squares (SPLS), a new algorithm that simultaneously fits planetary transits and background trends using a segmented double polynomial model. Prior to signal detection, the optimal polynomial order for the trend component is selected using Bayes factor-based model comparison. During the periodogram search, the Signal Detection Efficiency metric is used to assess signal significance. The algorithm is accelerated by a three-step approximation and nonlinear parameter sampling tailored to SPLS. We compare the performance of SPLS with traditional detrending-detection approaches across different orbital periods, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), planet radii and stellar noise levels on an injection-recovery test. When detecting signals with periods between 10 and 480 days and SNRs below 9, SPLS achieves at least a 22.6% higher true positive rate than other methods at the same 10% false positive rate. Using the threshold determined from the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, our method also recovers the most true signals while yielding the fewest false positives among all injected samples, and reaches a 97% recovery fraction in Kepler confirmed single-planet systems. The tests demonstrate that SPLS improves the detection of transiting planets, particularly for low-SNR, long-period signals. It offers the potential for finding Earth twins in future applications to data from Kepler, TESS, and upcoming PLATO and Earth 2.0 missions."

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations."

However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation."

Designed to provide toxicologists with a flexible tool applicable across diverse HTS assay platforms, DART reveals the latent processes driving dose-response behavior and predicts new activity profiles for chemical-gene pairs lacking experimental data. We demonstrate the performance of DART through simulation studies and an application to a vast new multi-experiment data set consisting of dose-response observations generated by the exposure of HepG2 cells to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), where it provides actionable guidance for chemical prioritization and inference on the structural and functional mechanisms underlying assay activation."

In this paper, we study the Ursell function in Ising lattice gauge theory. When the spins at the edges are used as random variables, we show that $U_n$ can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the configuration and the parameter $β$. When considering Wilson loops observables as random variables, using the tool of cluster expansion adapted to this setting, we prove that at sufficiently low temperature, for any number $n$ of disjoint Wilson loops, there exists a configuration of loops such that the Ursell function $U_n$ is positive.

While magnetic flux emergence and cancellation are widely recognized as key contributors to jet formation, the mechanisms behind repeated magnetic reconnection remain poorly understood. In this letter, we report a sequence of nine recurrent jets originating from active region AR 12715 during its decay phase, where the jet activity was associated with a complex distribution of fragmented magnetic flux. Non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations reveal the presence of low-lying, current-carrying loops beneath overarching open magnetic fields near the jet footpoints. These magnetic structures were perturbed by (i) emerging flux elements and (ii) interactions between oppositely polarized moving magnetic features (MMFs). To interpret these observations, we compare them with 3D radiative MHD simulation from the Bifrost model, which reproduce jet formation driven by interacting bipolar MMFs, leading to subsequent flux cancellation in the photosphere.

Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities."

Lagrangian or Hamiltonian neural networks provide useful structural guarantees but the learning of such models often leads to inconsistent models, especially on real physical systems where training data are limited, partial and noisy. Motivated by this observation and the objective to exploit these models for model-based nonlinear control, a learning algorithm relying on an original loss function is proposed to improve the physical consistency of Lagrangian systems. A comparative analysis of different learning-based modeling approaches with the proposed solution shows significant improvements in terms of physical consistency of the learned models, on both simulated and experimental systems. The model's consistency is then exploited to demonstrate, on an experimental benchmark, the practical relevance of the proposed methodology for feedback linearization and energy-based control techniques."

    "abstract": "We study the structural and dynamical consequences of introducing a distributional density profile inside a neutron star, representing a massless, topological shell located at an arbitrary radius. We incorporate this effect into the structure of neutron star and construct equilibrium sequence for several realistic equations of state. Radial stability is examined through the Sturm-Liouville formulation of the $\\ell=0$ perturbation equation, supplemented with a jump condition and imprinting distinct features on the fundamental $f$-mode spectrum. We find strong, non-monotonic variations in the mode frequency relative to standard no-shell models. Using first-principles scaling relations, we estimate various gravitational wave observables such as the damping time, quality factor, luminosity and characteristic strain. These observables are then compared with the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, and third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Our results demonstrate that internal topological shells can leave potentially observable signatures in the oscillation and gravitational wave properties of neutron stars."

    "abstract": "The existence of a fundamental zero-point length, $l_0$, a minimal spacetime scale predicted by T-duality in string theory or quantum gravity theories, modifies the entropy associated with the horizon of spacetime. In the cosmological setup, this leads to correction to the Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the Universe. In this paper, we investigate the implications of zero-point length $l_0$-corrected gravity for gravitational baryogenesis and early universe thermodynamics, deriving constraints on $l_0$ from observational baryon asymmetry data. We observe that under the condition of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, $l_0$ generates $\\dot{\\mathcal{R}}\\neq 0$ during radiation epoch, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar. This yields a baryon asymmetry parameter $η\\propto l_0^2 T_D^9/M_{\\rm Pl}^7$. The observed baryon asymmetry $η\\sim 9.9 \\times 10^{-11}$ constrains $l_0 \\lesssim 7.1 \\times 10^{-33} m$, approximately $440$ times the Planck length. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the zero-point length correction in the Friedmann equation, effectively slows the expansion rate at high energies, resulting in a modified time-temperature relationship where the Universe maintains higher temperatures for longer time during early epochs compared to standard cosmology. Our results establish zero-point length cosmology as a testable framework connecting quantum gravity to cosmological observables, with implications for early universe thermal history and fundamental length scales."

We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations."

    "abstract": "Reachability analysis has been a prominent way to provide safety guarantees for neurally controlled autonomous systems, but its direct application to neural perception components is infeasible due to imperfect or intractable perception models. Typically, this issue has been bypassed by complementing reachability with statistical analysis of perception error, say with conformal prediction (CP). However, existing CP methods for time-series data often provide conservative bounds. The corresponding error accumulation over time has made it challenging to combine statistical bounds with symbolic reachability in a way that is provable, scalable, and minimally conservative. To reduce conservatism and improve scalability, our key insight is that perception error varies significantly with the system's dynamical state. This article proposes state-dependent conformal prediction, which exploits that dependency in constructing tight high-confidence bounds on perception error. Based on this idea, we provide an approach to partition the state space, using a genetic algorithm, so as to optimize the tightness of conformal bounds. Finally, since using these bounds in reachability analysis leads to additional uncertainty and branching in the resulting hybrid system, we propose a branch-merging reachability algorithm that trades off uncertainty for scalability so as to enable scalable and tight verification. The evaluation of our verification methodology on two complementary case studies demonstrates reduced conservatism compared to the state of the art."

In this work, we rigorously prove that full phase-locking, phase-locking, frequency synchronization, and order-parameter synchronization are equivalent for arbitrary hybrid ensembles. The proof combines dissipative energy methods, LaSalle-type compactness arguments, the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem, and Thieme's asymptotically autonomous theory to demonstrate that synchronization equivalence is topological, determined solely by the finite equilibrium structure of the all-to-all network. This result provides a mathematically complete characterization of synchronization in finite oscillator systems and clarifies its geometric invariance across first-, second-, and hybrid-order models."

Under continuous incident light, we have observed the generation of quasi-steady excitons and their complexes, encompassing ground and excited state excitons, trions, as well as their intricate interplay. We further show spectral evidence of electronic excitation states within the background of quasi-steady excitonic complexes, characterized by valence band (VB) effective mass renormalization, the enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the formation of an excitonic gap near the Fermi level (EF ) of the conduction band (CB), and intervalley excitonic band folding. Our findings not only unveil a quasi-steady excitonic complex background for the creation of diverse electronic excitations in 2D semiconductors but also offer new insights into the role of excitons in the charge density wave (CDW) formation mechanism and facilitate the advancement of correlated electronic state engineering based on the coupling between electrons and excitonic complexes in a quasi-equilibrium state."

To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems."

In this model, the agents move at constant speed and control the curvature of their trajectory (i.e. the time-derivative of their velocity) so as to align their velocity with that of their neighbors, up to some noise. We provide a novel $n$-dimensional formulation of this model for any $n \\geq 3$ and derive its mean-field kinetic formulation using bundle geometry concepts. The target of the paper is the derivation of a fluid model in the hydrodynamic limit. We show that this fluid model is the \"self-organized hydrodynamic\" (SOH) model already found in earlier work pertaining to the Vicsek model. The derivation is based on the introduction of appropriate \"generalized collision invariants\" (GCI). The action of the $n$-dimensional orthogonal group is used to reduce the expression of the GCI to a set of two functions satisfying a system of equations which is solved by means of a variational formulation. This leads to explicit formulas for the coefficients of the SOH model in terms of those of the original interacting particle system."

The model is used to describe a deconfined yet massive quark phase of QCD at finite density, concluding that the equation of state of such a phase can be stiff enough to support exotic dense stars as massive as 2 solar masses. Nucleons are modeled phenomenologically using the Hebeler-et.al EFT baryon phases. For the stiff phenomenological baryon phases the transition to the quark phase is weakly first order allowing for stable quark cores. We also find that holographic baryons, modeled as wrapped D5-branes, provide unrealistic pressures (in the homogeneous approximation) and have to be discarded. We compute the mass vs. radius relation and tidal deformability for these hybrid stars. Contrary to a large number of other holographic models, this holographic model indicates that quark matter could be present at the core of heavy compact stars and may be used to explore the phenomenology of such objects."

The finding rejects the H01 hypothesis for BvMv, and agrees that IFRS has impact on value relevance. Besides, Ohlson's (1995) model documents that the coefficient of dummy variable (MODE) is positive. Therefore, the analysis concludes that IFRS has positive impact on value relevance. The aftermath of TEST-B rejects the H02 hypothesis for all profitability ratios (ROE, ROCE, ROA, PM) and gearing ratios (GR). It concludes that profitability and gearing ratios are affected by IFRS adoption, whereas efficiency-liquidity ratios are not. Also, in Forward Stepwise regression analysis only ROCE, ROA, and PM ratios show significant results. The analysis documents positive and significant impact of IFRS on these three ratios."

Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation.

Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning.

Specifically, we study the cases where the unitaries are applied periodically, quasiperiodically and randomly. For a periodic protocol, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied alternately, we find that end modes may appear, but the number of end modes does not always agree with the winding number which is a $Z$-valued topological invariant. We then study the Loschmidt echo ($LE$) starting with a random initial state. We find that the $LE$ exhibits pronounced oscillations whose Fourier transform has peaks at frequencies which agree with the most prominent gaps between pairs of quasienergies. Next, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a quasiperiodic way (we consider Fibonacci and Thue-Morse protocols), we study the $LE$ starting with an initial state which is an end mode of one of the unitaries. When the inter-cell hoppings differ by a small amount denoted by $ε$, and the time period $T$ of each unitary is also small, the distance between the unitaries is found to be proportional to $εT$. We then find that the $LE$ oscillates around a particular value for a very long time before decaying to zero. The deviation of the value of the $LE$ from 1 scales as $ε^2$ for a fixed value of $T$, while the time after which the $LE$ starts decaying to zero has an interesting dependence on $ε$ and $T$. Finally, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a random order, the $LE$ rapidly decays to zero with increasing time. We have presented a qualitative understanding of the above results."

This paper proposes an artificial-noise (AN)-aided PLS scheme for NF fluid-antenna multiple-input multiple-output (FA-MIMO) systems, with joint beamforming (BF) and AN design for both compact and large arrays. An alternating-optimization (AO) framework addresses the sparsity-constrained non-convex design by splitting it into a continuous BF/AN joint-design subproblem and a discrete FAS port-selection subproblem. Closed-form fully digital BF/AN solutions are obtained via a generalized spectral water-filling procedure within a block coordinate descent (BCD) surrogate and realized by a hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture that embeds AN in the baseband without extra radio-frequency (RF) chains. For FAS port selection, a row-energy based prune--refit rule, aligned with Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions of a group-sparsity surrogate, enables efficient active-port determination. Simulation results confirm that the proposed design exploits the geometry and position-domain DoF of FAS and significantly improves secrecy performance, particularly for non-extremely-large arrays where NF beam focusing alone is inadequate."

Despite the success achieved, current learning-based solutions regard community search, i.e., locating the best community for a given query, and community detection, i.e., partitioning the whole graph, as separate problems, necessitating task- and dataset-specific retraining. Such a strategy limits the applicability and generalization ability of the existing models. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on information from the target dataset, leading to suboptimal performance when supervision is limited or unavailable. To mitigate this limitation, we propose UniCom, a unified framework to solve both community search and detection tasks through knowledge transfer across multiple domains, thus alleviating the limitations of single-dataset learning. UniCom centers on a Domain-aware Specialization (DAS) procedure that adapts on the fly to unseen graphs or tasks, eliminating costly retraining while maintaining framework compactness with a lightweight prompt-based paradigm. This is empowered by a Universal Graph Learning (UGL) backbone, which distills transferable semantic and topological knowledge from multiple source domains via comprehensive pre-training. Both DAS and UGL are informed by local neighborhood signals and cohesive subgraph structures, providing consistent guidance throughout the framework. Extensive experiments on both tasks across 16 benchmark datasets and 22 baselines have been conducted to ensure a comprehensive and fair evaluation. UniCom consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines across all tasks under settings with scarce or no supervision, while maintaining runtime efficiency."

    "abstract": "In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods.

    "abstract": "Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning aims to train an agent deployed in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \\textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \\textbf{\\underline{D}}ynamics- and \\textbf{\\underline{V}}alue-aligned \\textbf{\\underline{D}}ata \\textbf{\\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines and delivers exceptional performance across multiple tasks and datasets."

In this article, we propose the existence of exotic BH-NS binaries which can open a new way in searching the missing BH-NS binaries in our Galaxy. By considering the possible dark matter density spikes formed around the primordial black holes in the BH-NS binaries, we show that extremely high temperature ($\\sim 10^6$ K) could be maintained on the surface of the neutron stars due to effective dark matter capture. This interesting feature can also help reveal the nature of dark matter and possibly further improve the upper limit of dark matter scattering cross section well below $10^{-47}$ cm$^2$."

    "abstract": "Vanadium oxide thin films exhibit temperature-driven electronic transitions desirable for sensing and microelectronic applications, yet their performance is often limited by thermal hysteresis. This study demonstrates that electronic stability is governed not simply by roughness or crystallinity but by a unique combination of surface morphological complexity and thermal hysteresis, revealed across films deposited with varying working pressure using Direct Current/Radio Frequency magnetron sputtering. Specifically, the film grown at 15 mTorr shows a distinct convergence of highest morphological vertical complexity and lowest thermal hysteresis, exhibiting nearly reversible transport with activation energies ranging from 0.26 to 0.28 eV and negative temperature coefficients of resistance between -0.0337 and -0.035 K-1. While conventional roughness metrics and mono-fractal parameters do not capture this behavior, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis uncovers a pronounced peak in multifractality strength, which correlates inversely with thermal hysteresis. This highlights multifractality strength as a predictive descriptor of electronic stability, identifying a multiscale structural signature that enhances stress accommodation during thermal cycling. These results define an optimal deposition window and provide a morphology-guided pathway for developing thermally robust mixed-phase vanadium oxide films."

Second, I show how to optimize over this class of policies to find the profit-maximizing comprehensible policy. I further demonstrate that it is optimal to estimate the comprehensible policy directly from the data, rather than projecting down the black box policy into a comprehensible policy. Third, I find the optimal black box targeting policy and compare it to the optimal comprehensible policy. I then empirically apply my framework using data from a price promotion field experiment from a durable goods retailer. I quantify the cost of explanation, which I define as the difference in expected profits between the optimal black box and comprehensible targeting policies. Compared to the black box benchmark, the comprehensible targeting policy reduces profits by 7.5% or 23 cents per customer."

In practice, however, the transparency is split across two worlds: verifiable on-chain traces and off-chain disclosures locked in unstructured text that are unconnected. We introduce a large language model (LLM)-based automated framework that bridges these two dimensions by aligning on-chain issuance data with off-chain disclosure statements. First, we propose an integrative framework using LLMs to capture and analyze on- and off-chain data through document parsing and semantic alignment, extracting key financial indicators from issuer attestations and mapping them to corresponding on-chain metrics. Second, we integrate multi-chain issuance records and disclosure documents within a model context protocol (MCP) framework that standardizes LLMs access to both quantitative market data and qualitative disclosure narratives. This framework enables unified retrieval and contextual alignment across heterogeneous stablecoin information sources and facilitates consistent analysis. Third, we demonstrate the capability of LLMs to operate across heterogeneous data modalities in blockchain analytics, quantifying discrepancies between reported and observed circulation and examining their implications for cross-chain transparency and price dynamics. Our findings reveal systematic gaps between disclosed and verifiable data, showing that LLM-assisted analysis enhances cross-modal transparency and supports automated, data-driven auditing in decentralized finance (DeFi)."

The model yields closed-form matching conditions and predicts the critical-coupling set. Full-wave FEM simulations and bench measurements validate the approach: with $h \\approx 0.55$~mm and backshort distance $\\approx 0.80$~mm, the return loss reaches $|S_{11}| \\approx -30$~dB near 17.8--18.1~GHz while sustaining peak electric fields of $\\sim 1.8 \\times 10^5$~V/m at the nozzle (normalized to 1~W).

Film, plug, and ligament flows are found in the hydrophilic PMF flow field, while slug and droplet flows are found in the hydrophobic PMF flow field. The results suggest that optimizing the pore size, increasing the metal foam surface hydrophobicity, and optimizing the operating condition are helpful for the water management of the PMF flow field. The frequency analysis of the pressure drop also shows that the dominant frequency can be used as an indicator to analyze the transition between different flow patterns."

We characterize the local and global topology of Yin sets. Then we give a unique boundary representation of Yin sets based on the notion of a glued surface, a quotient space of an orientable compact 2-manifold along a one-dimensional CW complex. Our results apply to 3D continua with arbitrarily complex topology and may be useful in a number of scientific and engineering applications such as solid modeling, computer-aided design, and numerical simulations of multiphase flows with topological changes."

However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}tyle-\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{GE}neralization framework (\\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings."

Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder.

Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB."

Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios."

First, using the solution concept of core, we investigate conditions under which it is beneficial for all users to cooperate, i.e., the grand coalition is stable. We provide several sets of sufficient conditions under which the core is non-empty as well as those under which the core is empty. Next, we use the concept of $\\mathbb{D}_c$-stability to identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the users in the network form a certain fixed number of coalitions such that all the users within each coalition cooperate among themselves. Our analytical results show how the values of different system parameters, e.g., data rates of different users, transmit and receive power, file size, bandwidth cost, etc., influence stability properties of coalitions, and provide a systematic approach to evaluating cooperation of users for multicast. We also study cooperation among different users using numerical computations. The problem of coalition formation in the context of multicast addressed in this paper is fundamental, and our analysis provides new insights into the feasibility of stable cooperative multicast strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of cooperation in wireless networks."

Corners are essential low-level features in event-driven computer vision, and novel algorithms utilizing event-based representations, such as Threshold-Ordinal Surface (TOS), have been developed for corner detection. However, the implementation of these algorithms on resource-constrained edge devices is hindered by significant latency, undermining the advantages of EBCs. To address this challenge, a near-memory architecture for efficient TOS updates (NM-TOS) is proposed. This architecture employs a read-write decoupled 8T SRAM cell and optimizes patch update speed through pipelining. Hardware-software co-optimized peripheral circuits and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) enable power and latency reductions. Compared to traditional digital implementations, our architecture reduces latency/energy by 24.7x/1.2x at Vdd = 1.2 V or 1.93x/6.6x at Vdd = 0.6 V based on 65nm CMOS process. Monte Carlo simulations confirm robust circuit operation, demonstrating zero bit error rate at operating voltages above 0.62 V, with only 0.2% at 0.61 V and 2.5% at 0.6 V. Corner detection evaluation using precision-recall area under curve (AUC) metrics reveals minor AUC reductions of 0.027 and 0.015 at 0.6 V for two popular EBC datasets."

In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work."

    "abstract": "Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench."

    "abstract": "We investigate the convective stability of a thin, infinite fluid layer with a rectangular cross-section, subject to imposed heat fluxes at the top and bottom and fixed temperature along the vertical sides. The instability threshold depends on the Prandtl number as well as the normalized flux difference ($f$) and decreases with the aspect ratio ($ε$), following a $εf^{-1}$ power law. Using 3D initial value and 2D eigenvalue calculations, we identify a dominant 3D mode characterized by two transverse standing waves attached to the domain edges. We characterize the dominant mode's frequency and transverse wave number as functions of the Rayleigh number and aspect ratio. An analytical asymptotic solution for the base state in the bulk is obtained, valid over most of the domain and increasingly accurate for lower aspect ratios. A local stability analysis, based on the analytical base state, reveals oscillatory transverse instabilities consistent with the global instability characteristics. The source term for this most unstable mode appears to be interactions between vertical shear and horizontal temperature gradients."

Interestingly, this interaction is \\emph{attractive} for charge transfer insulators such as cuprates. Considering a simple toy model for cuprates, without the antiferromagnetic exchange, this interaction leads to the correct d-wave superconducting gap, thus demonstrating its relevance."

The recently proposed Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a unifying framework for integrating external tools into agent systems, enabling a thriving open ecosystem of community-built functionalities. However, the openness and composability that make MCP appealing also introduce a critical yet overlooked security assumption -- implicit trust in third-party tool providers. In this work, we identify and formalize a new class of attacks that exploit this trust boundary without violating explicit permissions. We term this new attack vector implicit toxicity, where malicious behaviors occur entirely within the allowed privilege scope. We propose LeechHijack, a Latent Embedded Exploit for Computation Hijacking, in which an adversarial MCP tool covertly expropriates the agent's computational resources for unauthorized workloads. LeechHijack operates through a two-stage mechanism: an implantation stage that embeds a benign-looking backdoor in a tool, and an exploitation stage where the backdoor activates upon predefined triggers to establish a command-and-control channel. Through this channel, the attacker injects additional tasks that the agent executes as if they were part of its normal workflow, effectively parasitizing the user's compute budget. We implement LeechHijack across four major LLM families. Experiments show that LeechHijack achieves an average success rate of 77.25%, with a resource overhead of 18.62% compared to the baseline. This study highlights the urgent need for computational provenance and resource attestation mechanisms to safeguard the emerging MCP ecosystem."

However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability."

We show that two-dimensional continuous piecewise-linear maps near certain codimension-two homoclinic bifurcations are well approximated by a three-parameter family of one-dimensional maps. Each member of the one-dimensional family is discontinuous, because the family is constructed from the first return of iterates to a subset of phase space, and comprised of infinitely many linear pieces, where each piece corresponds to a fixed number of iterations near the saddle associated with the homoclinic bifurcation. The one-dimensional family exhibits period-incrementing, period-adding, bandcount-incrementing, and bandcount-adding structures (all typical for two-piece maps), as well as unique features caused by orbits repeatedly visiting more than two pieces of the map. These structures carry through to the two-dimensional maps with only minor differences in the arrangement of the bifurcations developing with the distance from the codimension-two bifurcations. This leads to a novel and vivid elucidation of the dynamics of the two-dimensional border-collision normal form."

Here, we present a large-scale benchmark evaluating over 340,000+ unique combinations of spatial and nonlinear EEG classification. Our methodological pipeline consists in combinations of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Riemannian geometry, functional connectivity, and fractal- or entropy-based features across three open-access EEG datasets. Unlike prior studies, our analysis operates at the per-participant level and across multiple frequency bands (8-15 Hz and 8-30 Hz), enabling direct assessment of both group-level performance and individual variability. Covariance tangent space projection (cov-tgsp) and CSP consistently achieved the highest average classification accuracies. However, their effectiveness was strongly dataset-dependent, and marked participant-level differences persisted, particularly in the most heterogeneous of the datasets. Importantly, nonlinear methods outperformed spatial approaches for specific individuals, underscoring the need for personalized pipeline selection. Our findings highlight that no universal 'one-size-fits-all' method can optimally decode EEG motor imagery patterns across all users or datasets. Future work will require adaptive, multimodal, and possibly novel approaches to fully address neurophysiological variability in practical BCI applications where the system can automatically adapt to what makes each user unique."

Our work applies to any encoding generator, also including a dependence on the parameter.

To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry.

Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality.

A complex structure with lines of first-order transitions, two triple points and a critical point appears at finite temperature. The phase diagram is two-dimensional, since there are two adjustable parameters, the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ and the temperature $T$. We show that the phase diagram does not present second-order phase transition lines, due to the fact that the order parameter is not a symmetry-breaking one. Quite remarkably, we are able to determine analytically one of the first-order phase-transition lines. We also prove that, when the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ is large and negative, the first-order transition temperature becomes asymptotically independent of $K$."

The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance."

    "abstract": "While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence."

    "abstract": "We consider additive functionals of systems of random measures whose initial configuration is given by a Poisson point process, and whose individual components evolve according to arbitrary Markovian or non-Markovian measure valued dynamics, with no structural assumptions beyond basic moment bounds. In this setting and under adequate conditions, we establish a general third moment theorem for the normalized functionals. Building on this result, we obtain the first quantitative bounds in the Wasserstein distance for a variety of moving-measure models initialized by Poisson-driven clouds of points, turning qualitative central limit theorems into explicit rates of convergence. The scope of the approach is then demonstrated through several examples, including systems driven by fractional Brownian motion, $α$-stable processes, uniformly elliptic diffusions, and spectral empirical measures arising from Dyson Brownian motion, all under broad assumptions on the control measure of the initial Poisson configuration. The analysis relies on a combination of Stein's method with Mecke's formula, in the spirit of the Poisson Malliavin-Stein methodology."

    "abstract": "We investigate the orbital dynamics and gravitational-wave signatures of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, described by the exact Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (Kerr--BR) solution~\\cite{Podolsky:2025tle}. In contrast to the widely used Kerr--Melvin metric, the Kerr--BR spacetime is of algebraic type~D, admits a clear asymptotic structure, and allows for a systematic analytic treatment of geodesics. By analyzing the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), we find that the external magnetic field consistently pushes the ISCO to larger radii \\(r_{\\rm ISCO}\\) for all spin configurations considered. Counterintuitively, despite this outward radial shift, the ISCO orbital frequency \\(Ω_{\\rm ISCO}\\) increases monotonically with the magnetic-field strength, leading to a robust ``blue-shift'' of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency. We further show that retrograde orbits are significantly more sensitive to magnetic fields than prograde orbits, and identify a frequency crossover phenomenon in which magnetic corrections can invert the usual spin--frequency hierarchy at the ISCO. Finally, employing a semi-analytic adiabatic evolution scheme driven by exact geodesic relations and a leading-order quadrupole flux, we generate inspiral waveforms and quantify the substantial dephasing induced by the magnetic field. Our results indicate that large-scale magnetic environments can leave observable imprints in EMRI signals for future space-based detectors such as LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, and that neglecting such effects in waveform models may introduce non-negligible biases in parameter estimation, particularly for the black-hole spin."

Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\\%$, which is a $3.7\\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction."

In this study, we establish a system in which the GCJG and a pressureless dark matter fluid exchange energy via a linear interaction term, $Q \\propto ρ_x$, being $ρ_{x}$ the dark energy density. By solving the conservation equations, we derive analytical expressions for the evolution of the dark energy and dark matter densities. The thermodynamic properties of this interacting system are then thoroughly analyzed. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that both dark components maintain positive temperatures, ensuring stability. Notably, the dark energy component transitions to a phantom regime in the past, a feature of interest for recent cosmological observations, without violating thermodynamic principles. The total entropy production is shown to be in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, an analysis of the specific heats suggests that while the dark matter sector remains thermodynamically stable, the dark energy sector undergoes a late-time phase transition, consistent with its entering into the phantom domain at effective level."

    "abstract": "Debugging is one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks in software development and circuit design. Several formula-based fault localisation (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs/circuits with multiple faults. This paper introduces CFaults, a novel fault localisation tool for C software and Boolean circuits with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localisation procedure. Experimental results on three benchmark sets, two of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, and one of Boolean circuits, ISCAS85, show that CFaults is faster at localising faults in C software than other FBFL approaches such as BugAssist, SNIPER, and HSD. On the ISCAS85 benchmark, CFaults is generally slower than HSD; however, it localises faults in only 6% fewer circuits, demonstrating that it remains competitive in this domain. Furthermore, CFaults produces only subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses (e.g., BugAssist and SNIPER)."

Reverberant indoor environments are particularly important. For real-time applications, room acous-tics simulation requires simplifications, however, the necessary acoustic level of detail (ALOD) remains unclear in order to capture all perceptually relevant effects. This study examines the impact of varying ALOD in simulations of three real environments: a living room with a coupled kitchen, a pub, and an underground station. ALOD was varied by generating different numbers of image sources for early reflections, or by excluding geo-metrical room details specific for each environment. Simulations were perceptually eval-uated using headphones in comparison to binaural room impulse responses measured with a dummy head in the corresponding real environments, or by using loudspeakers. The study assessed the perceived overall difference for a pulse stimulus, a played electric bass and a speech token. Additionally, plausibility, speech intelligibility, and externaliza-tion were evaluated. Results indicate that a strong reduction in ALOD is feasible while maintaining similar plausibility, speech intelligibility, and externalization as with dummy head recordings. The number and accuracy of early reflections appear less relevant, pro-vided diffuse late reverberation is appropriately represented."

The magnetron is considered as a two-port oscillator, and the filament structures of it are used as a port for injection locking. To our knowledge, it is the first time that microwaves have been injected through magnetron filaments. The microwave is injected into the magnetron filter box using a self-designed injection structure, entering the resonant cavity through filament leads. The intrinsic isolation between the magnetrons output and filament is utilized as an isolator. No waveguide circulators or couplers between the injection source and the magnetron were used in the system, resulting in low cost and compact injection locking. Two types of injection structures were performed. The maximum locking bandwidth of 0.7 MHz was achieved at an injection ratio of 0.2. The weight and volume of the proposed injection-locked magnetron system were reduced to 28% and 16%, respectively. The magnetron output is successfully locked by an external signal. The experiment results reveal that the proposed low-cost injection-locked oven magnetron system works reliably. It has significant potential applications for future microwave ovens with frequency-selective heating to improve both efficiency and uniformity."

AVC fulfilling a certain set of linear equations are called symmetrizable and are known to be prone to denial of service attacks. Recent work has shown that deciding if a given AVC is symmetrizable or not is a non-Turing computable problem. By relaxing the formulation of symmetrizability, we show the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm that determines whether a given AVC is non-symmetrizable, but displays a critical dependence on the number of jammer input states. We then show how imposing an energy constraint on the jammer allows the same algorithm to efficiently identify large classes of AVCs which are non-symmetrizable."

    "abstract": "Very high-energy (VHE) detected flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are relatively few despite being the most persistent bright MeV-GeV sources. Focusing on VHE emission, we investigated the spectral and temporal properties of VHE-detected FSRQs using 14-year Fermi-LAT data. All are highly variable (flux-amplitude$>$100) with VHE detection associated with brighter flux states and relatively harder spectra. Above a flux limit, flux anti-correlates with spectral index, exhibiting a bluer-when-brighter trend. The low-flux state spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all resembles a power-law, while high-flux and VHE-associated states resemble a log-parabola, accompanied by an almost nil (PKS0736+017, PKS1510-089) to marginal (4C+21.35, 3C279) to significant (B21420+32, TON0599, PKS1441+25, S30218+35, PKS0346-27, OP313) MeV-GeV peak-upshift -- more prominent in high-redshift sources. For no/marginal peak-upshift, the VHE emission is consistent with external Comptonization of infrared photons (EC-IR) driven primarily by a power-law continuation of the particle spectrum to higher energies. For those with a significant MeV-GeV peak-upshift, PKS0346-27 and OP313 shows peak-upshift in the synchrotron spectrum, and thus VHE is EC-IR origin, while for others without synchrotron-peak upshift, we attribute the VHE to an HBL-like component with a Compton-Dominance (CD) like FSRQs, with VHE driven primarily by particle spectrum continuation. In some, even high-state SEDs seem to require an HBL-like component. Thus, VHE activities in FSRQs mainly result from particle spectrum continuation, aided by spectral transition or a new HBL-like component with FSRQ-like CD. Such spectral changes naturally brighten the GeV-VHE flux, overcoming extragalactic background light absorption without requiring extraordinary brightening under the traditional EC-IR scenario than normally exhibited."

We robustly identified $11,346$ quasars, of which $5,386$ are newly discovered objects not present in the Million Quasars catalog. This release brings the total number of quasars identified by the 12-year LAMOST survey to $67,521$, of which $29,513$ are newly discovered. While the absolute flux calibration for LAMOST quasar spectra from Data Releases 6 to 9 was previously performed using the SDSS/PanSTARRS1 multi-band photometric data, the inherent variability of quasars can affect the flux accuracy. To address this limitation, we recalibrated the LAMOST spectra using (quasi-)simultaneous photometric data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has conducted high-cadence sky monitoring since March 2018. Based on the recalibrated single-epoch spectra, we estimated the emission line fluxes, continuum fluxes, and virial black hole masses. These improved spectra facilitate direct comparison with the spectra of common quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), enabling searches for rare quasars, such as changing-look quasars exhibiting the appearance or disappearance of broad emission lines and broad absorption line quasars. The combined dataset of photometry and multi-epoch spectra will enhance the detections of AGN-related transients, such as Bowen fluorescence flares and extreme variability quasars, thereby improving our understanding of quasar variability."

Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples."

Using transport measurements supported by Usadel theory, we demonstrate that this phase originates from the contact-induced weakening of superconductivity together with Joule heating, rather than intrinsic material properties.

We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance."

In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines.

    "abstract": "A few analytic exponential models of elastic differential cross section, constructed as purely phenomenological models, are proposed and tested. The models incorporate energy-dependent exponential slopes, power-law prefactors, and localized Gaussian modifications which are built to reproduce the observed dip region, supplemented in some cases by logarithmic $t$-dependent slopes. Simple additive sub-leading exponential contributions that represent charge conjugation and isospin roles are introduced in the models to increase applicability and quality of fit across elastic differential cross section data of $np$, $n\\bar{p}$, $pp$, and $p\\bar{p}$ elastic scattering. The models reproduce the characteristic features of the elastic scattering data such as the dip-bump structure, shrinkage of the forward peak, and controlled curvature that is localized around the dip. Parameters of the models are found by fitting the experimental data of elastic $np$ differential cross section in an energy range of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 3.36 GeV to 26.02 GeV, across a momentum range of $0.065 \\leq \\mid t\\mid \\leq 5.341 \\textrm{GeV}^{2}$. The parameter values and their ranges, obtained by $χ^{2}$ minimization are found within their assumed expected bounds with the $np$ data fitting. The total cross section, the slope parameter, the interaction radius, the total elastic cross section, the inelastic cross section, the ratios $σ_{el}/σ_{tot}$, and $σ_{inel}/σ_{tot}$ are predicted by the models for the $np$ scattering at all the energies, which show accurate quantitative agreement with their reference values. The results show that the proposed models not only provide accurate quantitative description of $np$ elastic differential cross section but also yield estimates of the observables that are consistent with theoretical expectations from Regge phenomenology and high-energy scattering constraints."

    "abstract": "The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision."

For fast switching ($τ/τ_0 \\lesssim 1$) the motion is homogeneous and Brownian, whereas for slow switching ($τ/τ_0 \\gg 1$) the particle exhibits intermittent dynamics and an enhanced diffusion coefficient. Analysis of the single-particle overlap function $Q(t)$ and the dynamic susceptibility $χ_4(t)$ reveals decoupling of the diffusion coefficient from the average friction upon cooling, which coincides with increasing temporal dynamic heterogeneity. This minimal model provides a transparent framework for understanding single-particle transport in media with fluctuating local mobility, including supercooled liquids and phase-separated soft materials."

    "abstract": "We develop a \"precision-ready\", model-independent EFT framework that connects general leptophilic gauge interactions to their low-energy manifestations in SMEFT and LEFT. Starting from a broad U(1)'_ell extension in which leptons carry family-dependent charges (q_e, q_mu, q_tau) while quarks remain neutral, quantum consistency is ensured through a minimal set of vectorlike leptons, chiral under U(1)'_ell but vectorlike under the SM, together with singlet scalars responsible for symmetry breaking and the masses of both Z_ell and the heavy leptons. In the heavy-mediator limit, we integrate out Z_ell at tree level and derive compact, analytic SMEFT Wilson coefficients for four-lepton operators and Higgs-current structures, including hypercharge-U(1)'_ell kinetic mixing proportional to Tr(Y Q'). Renormalization-group evolution down to the electroweak scale and matching onto LEFT produce closed-form expressions directly applicable to e+e- -> l+l-, neutrino trident production, nu e scattering, parity-violating Moeller observables, and muon-decay parameters. A single parameter combination, Lambda_eff = M_Zell / (g_ell * sqrt(|q q'|)), governs all leading EFT signatures, offering a unified way to map UV charge assignments onto precision observables. We delineate the validity domain of this EFT and outline its use as a \"plug-and-play\" interface for global fits, collider recasts, and future-collider projections."

Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits."

In this work, we show that the lower bound on the support of this problem is $2^{Ω(d)}$. Our lower bound matches the upper bound of $2^d$ given by Eisenbrand and Shmonin [Oper.Research Letters '06] up to a constant factor. This result has direct implications for the time complexity of several Bin Packing algorithms, such as Goemans and Rothvoss [SODA '14], Jansen and Klein [SODA '17] and Jansen and Solis-Oba [IPCO '10]. To achieve our main result, we develop a technique to aggregate equality constrained ILPs with many constraints into an equivalent ILP with one constraint. Our technique contrasts existing aggregation techniques as we manage to integrate upper bounds on variables into the resulting constraint. We believe this technique can be useful for solving general ILPs or the $d$-dimensional knapsack problem."

To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNNs deliver more reliable representations of epistemic uncertainty and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift on heterophilic graphs."

    "abstract": "Born-rule generative modeling, a central task in quantum machine learning, seeks to learn probability distributions that can be efficiently sampled by measuring complex quantum states. One hope is for quantum models to efficiently capture probability distributions that are difficult to learn and simulate by classical means alone. Quantum Boltzmann machines were proposed about one decade ago for this purpose, yet efficient training methods have remained elusive. In this paper, I overcome this obstacle by proposing a practical solution that trains quantum Boltzmann machines for Born-rule generative modeling. Two key ingredients in the proposal are the Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of the classical relative entropy and the quantum Boltzmann gradient estimator of [Patel et al., arXiv:2410.12935]. I present the main result for a more general ansatz known as an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine [Minervini et al., arXiv:2501.03367], which combines parameterized real- and imaginary-time evolution. I also show how to extend the findings to other distinguishability measures beyond relative entropy. Finally, I present four different hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for the minimax optimization underlying training, and I discuss their theoretical convergence guarantees."

In this paper we introduce new combinatorial and analytic tools that allow us to compute the Lyapunov exponent, and hence the Hausdorff dimension, in a broad class of examples where stationary measures are continuous. As an application, we complete the dimension computation in the setting where a single digit is forbidden; for example, we determine the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of the middle-seventh Cantor set with a random translate of itself."

This leads to a general lower bound for the stationary entropy production rate that extends the well-known Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR). Such an augmented TUR, which incorporates the statistics of the recurrences, proves to be tighter than the standard one far from equilibrium, and potentially offers new opportunities for the optimization and design of biological and chemical out-of-equilibrium systems at the nanoscale."

    "abstract": "Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE."

Despite this, recent mid-infrared spectra of the central 0.5-1.1 kpc of five QSO2s at z~0.1, obtained with the MRS module of JWST/MIRI, revealed 9.7, 18, and 23 micron silicate features in emission in two of them. This indicates that the high angular resolution of JWST/MIRI now allows us to peer into their nuclear region, exposing some of the directly illuminated dusty clouds that produce silicate emission. To test this, we fitted the nuclear mid-infrared spectrum of the QSO2 with the strongest silicate features, J1010, with two different sets of torus models implemented in an updated version of the Bayesian tool {\\tt BayesClumpy}. These are the CLUMPY and the CAT3D-WIND models. The CAT3D-WIND model is preferred by the observations based on the marginal likelihood and fit residuals, although the two torus models successfully reproduce the spectrum by means of intermediate covering factors ($\\rm C_T=0.45\\pm^{0.26}_{0.18}$ and $\\rm C_T=0.66\\pm^{0.16}_{0.17}$ for the CLUMPY and CAT3D-WIND models) and low inclinations ($\\rm i=50^\\circ\\pm^{8^\\circ}_{9^\\circ}$ and $\\rm i=13^\\circ\\pm^{7^\\circ}_{6^\\circ}$). Indeed, four of the five QSO2s with JWST/MIRI observations, including J1010, are in the blowout or ''forbidden'' region of the Eddington ratio-column density diagram, indicating that they are actively clearing gas and dust from their nuclear regions, leading to reduced covering factors. This is in contrast with Seyfert 2 galaxies observed with JWST, which are in the ''permitted'' regions of the diagram and show 9.7 micron silicate features in absorption. This supports a scenario where the more luminous the AGN and the higher their Eddington ratio, the lower the torus covering factor, driven by radiation pressure on dusty gas."

CryptoQA contains over two million QA pairs drawn from curated academic sources, along with contextual metadata that can be used to test the cryptographic capabilities of LLMs and to train new LLMs on cryptographic tasks. We benchmark 15 state-of-the-art LLMs on CryptoQA, evaluating their factual accuracy, mathematical reasoning, consistency, referencing, backward reasoning, and robustness to adversarial samples. In addition to quantitative metrics, we provide expert reviews that qualitatively assess model outputs and establish a gold-standard baseline. Our results reveal significant performance deficits of LLMs, particularly on tasks that require formal reasoning and precise mathematical knowledge. This shows the urgent need for LLM assistants tailored to cryptography research and development. We demonstrate that, by using CryptoQA, LLMs can be fine-tuned to exhibit better performance on cryptographic tasks."

    "abstract": "Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems."

    "abstract": "Imitation learning for robotic grasping is often plagued by the multimodal problem: when a scene contains multiple valid targets, demonstrations of grasping different objects create conflicting training signals. Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks."

We conducted five panel discussions based on open-ended questions regarding experiences with vulnerability reports, tools used for vulnerability discovery and management, organizational structures to report vulnerability response and management, preparedness and implementations for Cyber Resilience Act1 (CRA) and NIS22, and bug bounties. The open discussions enabled mutual sharing and shed light on common challenges that industry practitioners with practical experience face when securing their software supply chain, including vulnerability response. In this paper, we provide a summary of the Summit. Full panel questions can be found in the appendix."

    "abstract": "Chemical models are routinely used to predict the atmospheric composition of exoplanets and compare it with the composition retrieved from observations, but little is known about the reliability of the calculated composition. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to quantify the uncertainties in the abundances calculated by a state-of-the-art chemical atmosphere model of the widely observed planets WASP-33b, HD209458b, HD189733b, WASP-39b, GJ436b, and GJ1214b. We found that the abundance uncertainties in the observable atmosphere are relatively small, below one order of magnitude and in many cases below a factor of two, where vertical mixing is a comparable or even larger source of uncertainty than (photo)chemical kinetics. In general, planets with a composition close to chemical equilibrium have smaller abundance uncertainties than planets whose composition is dominated by photochemistry. Some molecules, such as H2O, CO, CO2, and SiO, show low abundance uncertainties, while others such as HCN, SO2, PH3, and TiO have more uncertain abundances. We identified several critical albeit poorly constrained processes involving S-, P-, Si-, and Ti-bearing species whose better characterization should lead to a global improvement in the accuracy of models. Some of these key processes are the three-body association reactions S + H2, Si + O, NH + N, and N2H2 + H; the chemical reactions S + OH --> SO + H, NS + NH2 --> H2S + N2, P + PH --> P2 + H, and N + NH3 --> N2H + H2; and the photodissociation of molecules such as P2, PH2, SiS, CH, and TiO."

    "abstract": "Multimedia Event Extraction (MEE) has become an important task in information extraction research as news today increasingly prefers to contain multimedia content. Current MEE works mainly face two challenges: (1) Inadequate extraction framework modeling for handling complex and flexible multimedia event structure; (2) The absence of multimodal-aligned training data for effective knowledge transfer to MEE task. In this work, we propose a Stepwise Schema-Guided Prompting Framework (SSGPF) using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as backbone for adaptive structure capturing to solve MEE task. At the initial step of SSGPF, we design Event Type Schema Guided Prompting (ETSGP) for event detection, then we devise Argument Role Schema Guided Prompting (ARSGP) that contains multi-step prompts with text-bridged grounding technique for argument extraction. We construct a weakly-aligned multimodal event labeled dataset based on existing unimodal event annotations, then conduct parameter efficient instruction tuning with LoRA on LLaVA-v1.5-7B under SSGPF. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark demonstrate that SSGPF significantly outperforms current SOTA baselines by 5.8 percent F1 on event detection and 8.4 percent F1 on argument extraction."

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data."

    "abstract": "Accurate beam prediction is essential for maintaining reliable links and high spectral efficiency in dynamic low-altitude wireless networks. However, existing approaches often fail to capture the deep correlations across heterogeneous sensing modalities, limiting their adaptability in complex three-dimensional environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose a multi-modal predictive beamforming method based on a cross-attention fusion mechanism that jointly leverages visual and structured sensor data. The proposed model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn multi-scale spatial feature hierarchies from visual images and a Transformer encoder to capture cross-dimensional dependencies within sensor data. Then, a cross-attention fusion module is introduced to integrate complementary information between the two modalities, generating a unified and discriminative representation for accurate beam prediction. Through experimental evaluations conducted on a real-world dataset, our method reaches 79.7% Top-1 accuracy and 99.3% Top-3 accuracy, surpassing the 3D ResNet-Transformer baseline by 4.4%-23.2% across Top-1 to Top-5 metrics. These results verify that multi-modal cross-attention fusion is effective for intelligent beam selection in dynamic low-altitude wireless networks."

While training costs usually capture public attention, inference demands are also contributing in significant computational, energy and environmental footprints. Sparsity stands out as a critical mechanism for drastically reducing these resource demands. However, its potential remains largely untapped and is not yet fully incorporated in production AI systems. To bridge this gap, this work provides the necessary knowledge and insights for performance engineers keen to get involved in deep learning inference optimization. In particular, in this work we: a) discuss the various forms of sparsity that can be utilized in DNN inference, b) explain how the original dense computations translate to sparse kernels, c) provide an extensive bibliographic review of the state-of-the-art in the implementation of these kernels for CPUs and GPUs, d) discuss the availability of sparse datasets in support of sparsity-related research and development, e) explore the current software tools and frameworks that provide robust sparsity support, and f) present evaluation results of different implementations of the key SpMM and SDDMM kernels on CPU and GPU platforms. Ultimately, this paper aims to serve as a resource for performance engineers seeking to develop and deploy highly efficient sparse deep learning models in productions."

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the popularity of user-generated content (UGC) is essential for advancing social media analytics and recommendation systems. Existing approaches typically follow an inductive paradigm, where researchers train static models on historical data for popularity prediction. However, the UGC propagation is inherently a dynamic process, and static modeling based on historical features fails to capture the complex interactions and nonlinear evolution. In this paper, we propose PopSim, a novel simulation-based paradigm for social media popularity prediction (SMPP). Unlike the inductive paradigm, PopSim leverages the large language models (LLMs)-based multi-agent social network sandbox to simulate UGC propagation dynamics for popularity prediction. Specifically, to effectively model the UGC propagation process in the network, we design a social-mean-field-based agent interaction mechanism, which models the dual-channel and bidirectional individual-population interactions, enhancing agents' global perception and decision-making capabilities. In addition, we propose a multi-source information aggregation module that transforms heterogeneous social metadata into a uniform formulation for LLMs. Finally, propagation dynamics with multimodal information are fused to provide comprehensive popularity prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SimPop consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, reducing prediction error by an average of 8.82%, offering a new perspective for research on the SMPP task."

Using a sample of Chinese listed firms (2008-2023), we address sparse AI data with a novel pruned training window method, testing multiple machine learning models. We find that AI adoption consistently increases predictive accuracy, with the largest gains in recall rates for identifying distressed firms. Tree-based models and AI density metrics proved most effective. Crucially, models using longer histories outperformed those relying solely on recent \"AI-rich\" data. The analysis also identifies divergent adoption patterns, with healthy firms exhibiting earlier and higher AI uptake than distressed peers. These findings, while based on Chinese data, provide a framework for early-warning signals and demonstrate the broader potential of AI metrics as a stable, complementary risk indicator distinct from traditional accounting measures."

We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis."

    "abstract": "Studying learning-related plasticity is central to understanding the acquisition of complex skills, for example learning to master a musical instrument. Over the past three decades, conventional group-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have advanced our understanding of how humans' neural representations change during skill acquisition. However, group-based fMRI studies average across heterogeneous learners and often rely on coarse pre- versus post-training comparisons, limiting the spatial and temporal precision with which neural changes can be estimated. Here, we outline an individual-specific precision approach that tracks neural changes within individuals by collecting high-quality neuroimaging data frequently over the course of training, mapping brain function in each person's own anatomical space, and gathering detailed behavioral measures of learning, allowing neural trajectories to be directly linked to individual learning progress. Complementing fMRI with mobile neuroimaging methods, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), will enable researchers to track plasticity during naturalistic practice and across extended time scales. This multi-modal approach will enhance sensitivity to individual learning trajectories and will offer more nuanced insights into how neural representations change with training. We also discuss how findings can be generalized beyond individuals, including through statistical methods based on replication in additional individuals. Together, this approach allows researchers to design highly informative longitudinal training studies that advance a mechanistic, personalized account of skill learning in the human brain."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs."

    "abstract": "Causal analyses derived from observational data underpin high-stakes decisions in domains such as healthcare, public policy, and economics. Yet such conclusions can be surprisingly fragile: even minor data errors - duplicate records, or entry mistakes - may drastically alter causal relationships. This raises a fundamental question: how robust is a causal claim to small, targeted modifications in the data? Addressing this question is essential for ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility of empirical findings. We introduce SubCure, a framework for robustness auditing via cardinality repairs. Given a causal query and a user-specified target range for the estimated effect, SubCure identifies a small set of tuples or subpopulations whose removal shifts the estimate into the desired range. This process not only quantifies the sensitivity of causal conclusions but also pinpoints the specific regions of the data that drive those conclusions. We formalize this problem under both tuple- and pattern-level deletion settings and show both are NP-complete. To scale to large datasets, we develop efficient algorithms that incorporate machine unlearning techniques to incrementally update causal estimates without retraining from scratch. We evaluate SubCure across four real-world datasets covering diverse application domains. In each case, it uncovers compact, high-impact subsets whose removal significantly shifts the causal conclusions, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional methods fail to detect. Our results demonstrate that cardinality repair is a powerful and general-purpose tool for stress-testing causal analyses and guarding against misleading claims rooted in ordinary data imperfections."

    "abstract": "We introduce a multi-parameter family of random edge weights on the Aztec diamond graph, given by certain Gamma variables, and prove several results about the corresponding random dimer measures. Firstly, we show there is no phase transition at the level of the free energy. This provides rigorous backing for the physics predictions of Zeng-Leath-Hwa and later works that dimer models with random weights are in the glassy `super-rough' phase at all temperatures with no phase transition. Secondly, we show that the random dimer covers themselves enjoy exact distributional equalities of certain marginals with path locations in new `hybrid' integrable polymers. These reduce to the stationary log-Gamma, strict-weak, and Beta polymer in random environment in certain cases, allowing transfer of known results from integrable polymers to dimers with random weights. As an example application, we prove that the turning points at the boundaries of the Aztec diamond exhibit fluctuations of order $n^{2/3}$, in contrast to the $n^{1/2}$ fluctuations for deterministic weights. Underlying all these is a key integrability property of the weights: they are the unique family for which independence is preserved under the shuffling algorithm."

We find a completely broken phase where information is retained by the quantum system, a strong-to-weak broken phase where information is leaked to the environment, and an unbroken phase where information is learned by the observer. We find that weak measurement and dephasing alone constitute a minimal model for generic open systems with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, but we also explore perturbations by unitary gates. For a 1d set of qubits, we examine information-theoretic and symmetry-breaking observables in the path integral of the doubled state. This path integral reduces to the standard classical 2d random-bond Ising model in certain limits but generically involves negative weights, enabling a special self-dual random-bond Ising model at the critical point when only measurements are present. We obtain numerical evidence for the steady-state phases using efficient tensor network simulations of the doubled state."

While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system.

The results are applied to derive the almost sure and $L^2$ convergence of stochastic versions of the proximal point algorithm, as well as of randomized block-iterative projective splitting methods for solving systems of coupled inclusions involving a mix of set-valued, cocoercive, and Lipschitzian monotone operators combined via various monotonicity-preserving operations."

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers excellent soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation, but its long acquisition time limits clinical utility. Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks."

We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+).

Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation."

    "abstract": "We present new MIRI F560W, F770W and F1000W imaging of GN-z11, extending the previous rest-frame coverage from 0.38 to 0.86$μ$m. We report significant detections (14$σ$) in the F560W and F770W images, and a marginal detection (3.2$σ$) in F1000W. Here, we analyse its SED combining new MIRI imaging data with archival NIRSpec/Prism and MRS spectroscopy, and NIRCam imaging. The continuum emission shows a flat energy distribution, in f$_ν$, up to 0.5$μ$m, compatible with the presence of a mixed stellar population of young (4$\\pm$1 Myr) and mature (63$\\pm$23 Myr) stars that also account for the [O III], H$β$ and H$α$ emission lines. The continuum at rest-frame 0.66$μ$m shows a 36$\\pm$3% flux excess above the predicted flux for a mixed stellar population, pointing to the presence of an additional source contributing at these wavelengths. This excess increases to 91$\\pm$28% at rest-frame 0.86$μ$m, although with a large uncertainty due to the marginal detection in the F1000W filter. We consider that hot dust emission in the dusty torus around a type 2 AGN could be responsible for the observed excess. Alternatively, this excess could be due to hot dust emission or to a photoluminiscence dust process (Extended Red Emission, ERE) under the extreme UV radiation field, as observed in some local metal-poor galaxies and in young compact starbursts. The presence of a type 1 AGN is not supported by the observed SED since high-z QSOs contribute at wavelengths above rest-frame 1$μ$m, and an additional ad-hoc red source would be required to explain the observed flux excess at 0.66 and 0.86$μ$m. Additional deep MIRI imaging covering the rest-frame near-IR are needed to confirm the flux detection at 10$μ$m with higher significance, and to discriminate between the different hot dust emission in the extreme starburst and AGN scenarios with MIRI imaging at longer wavelengths."

We will focus on more specialized graph container methods due to Sapozhenko (1987) that deal with sets in expander graphs. Entropy, first introduced by Shannon (1948) in the area of information theory, is a measure of the expected amount of information contained in a random variable. Entropy has seen lots of fascinating applications in a wide range of enumeration problems. In this survey article, we will discuss recent developments that exploit a combination of the two methods on enumerating graph homomorphisms."

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in 3D object detection, point clouds remain challenging due to sparse data, incomplete structures, and limited semantic information. Capturing contextual relationships between distant objects presents additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose GraphFusion3D, a unified framework combining multi-modal fusion with advanced feature learning. Our approach introduces the Adaptive Cross-Modal Transformer (ACMT), which adaptively integrates image features into point representations to enrich both geometric and semantic information. For proposal refinement, we introduce the Graph Reasoning Module (GRM), a novel mechanism that models neighborhood relationships to simultaneously capture local geometric structures and global semantic context. The module employs multi-scale graph attention to dynamically weight both spatial proximity and feature similarity between proposals. We further employ a cascade decoder that progressively refines detections through multi-stage predictions. Extensive experiments on SUN RGB-D (70.6\\% AP$_{25}$ and 51.2\\% AP$_{50}$) and ScanNetV2 (75.1\\% AP$_{25}$ and 60.8\\% AP$_{50}$) demonstrate a substantial performance improvement over existing approaches."

Using new definitions of Poisson and symplectic slices, we prove analogues of the classical symplectic slice theorems for Hamiltonian actions of complex reductive algebraic groups. These analogues have versions in the complex-algebraic and holomorphic categories, and make extensive use of Slodowy slices and decomposition classes in complex reductive Lie algebras. The starting point for our second setting is the fact that Hamiltonian Lie group actions are special cases of Hamiltonian symplectic groupoid actions. We generalize the classical symplectic slice theorems to the latter case."

Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations."

We relate the recovery performance of Glauber dynamics on the annealed posterior to the performance of Approximate Message Passing (AMP), which is known to achieve Bayes-optimal performance. Our main results rely on the analysis of an auxiliary Markov chain called restricted Gaussian dynamics (RGD). Concretely, we establish the following results: 1. RGD can be reduced to an effective one-dimensional recursion which mirrors the evolution of the AMP iterates. 2. From a warm start, RGD rapidly converges to a fixed point in correlation space, which recovers Bayes-optimal performance when run on the posterior. 3. Conditioned on widely believed mixing results for the SK model, we recover the phase transition for non-trivial inference."

While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods. Finally, we validate our results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware."

QLA is an initial value scheme that consists of a sequence of unitary collision and streaming operators, with appropriate potential operators, that recover Maxwell equations in inhomogeneous dielectric media to second order in the lattice discreteness. For the case of total internal reflection, there is transient energy transfer into the second medium due to the evanescent fields as the Poynting unit vector of the pulse is rotated from its incident to reflected direction. Because of the finite spatial extent of the pulse, a self-consistent Goos-Hanchen-type displacement along the interface is found without imposing any explicit interface boundary conditions on the fields. For normal incidence. the standard Fresnel coefficients are recovered for appropriately averaged QLA fields. Energy is conserved at all times to seven significant figures."

We further assess the influence of perceived humanness and analyze open-ended responses to uncover listener criteria for judging AI-generated music. Attitudes toward AI proved to be the best predictor of both liking and emotional intensity of AI-generated music. This quantitative finding was complemented by qualitative themes from our thematic analysis, which identified ethical, cultural, and contextual considerations as important criteria in listeners' evaluations of AI-generated music. Our results offer a nuanced view of how people experience music created by AI tools and point to key factors and methodological considerations for future research on music perception in human-AI interaction."

This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model.

We selected LiTi2O4, LiV2O4, and MgTi2O4 because they serve as quintessential examples of spinel oxides' diverse and intriguing electronic phenomena. LiV2O4 heavy fermion behaviour challenges traditional theories in d-electron systems, LiTi2O4 being the first oxide superconductor provides critical insights into unconventional superconductivity driven by strong electron-phonon interactions, and MgTi2O4 pronounced orbital ordering and metalinsulator transition offers a clear model for exploring electron-lattice coupling. This shows how the inherent structural versatility of the spinel lattice, characterised by its cubic close-packed oxygen network and variable cation distributions, enables a rich interplay of electron-electron correlations, electron-lattice coupling, and orbital degrees of freedom. In LiV2O4, the combination of mixed-valence vanadium ions and a geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattice gives rise to heavy fermion behaviour, whereas LiTi2O4 exhibits unconventional superconductivity driven by a high density of states at the Fermi level and strong electronphonon interactions. MgTi2O4 undergoes a pronounced metal-insulator transition, where orbital ordering triggers a Peierls-like distortion that stabilises a low-temperature insulating state through Ti-Ti dimerization. How the composition of these compounds affects their properties, based on both theoretical research and experimental findings, is illustrated by this review. It illustrates the promise of Spinels in practical technologies such as energy storage, electrocatalysis, and high-temperature lubrication."

This essay examines the justification of MOND by assessing its inter-theoretical relationship to established theories across relevant scales, in particular its connection to Newtonian gravitation. We argue that MOND fails a key condition for a theory's justification--what we call 'reduction-wise justification'--since it does not adequately reduce to Newtonian gravity in a fully non-arbitrary way. More precisely, despite satisfying the standard formal criteria for successful limiting reduction, MOND does not properly reduce to Newtonian gravitation because of (i) the absence of a fundamental theoretical framework to justify the interpolating function introduced in MOND and (ii) the lack of a unified mathematical structure working across all scales, independent of Newtonian theory. Hence, the case study of MOND provides crucial results for the general debate on inter-theoretic reduction in science: MOND's failure as a case of reduction highlights important limitations in standard accounts of limiting reduction. We respond by proposing a more refined framework for limiting reduction that introduces two additional criteria to better distinguish successful from pathological reductions. More broadly, this case illustrates how analysing reduction-wise justification can serve as a powerful tool for evaluating the validity of novel theories that are not yet empirically established."

We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\\% for both benign and harmful tasks.

This setup achieves a high electric field intensity of 6.9 kV/m in the near-field from a dual-feed waveguide antenna, enabling a Rabi frequency as high as 71 MHz for the rotational transition of sodium-potassium molecules. In addition, the low noise signal source and controlled electronics provide ultralow phase-noise and dynamically tunable polarization. Narrow-band filters within the MW circuitry further reduce phase-noise by more than 20 dB at 20 MHz offset frequency, ensuring prolonged one-body molecular lifetimes up to 10 seconds. We also show practical methods to measure the MW field strength and polarization using a simple homemade dipole probe, and to characterize phase-noise down to -170 dBc/Hz with a commercial spectrum analyser and a notch filter. Those capabilities allowed us to evaporatively cool our molecular sample to deep quantum degeneracy. Furthermore, the polarization tunability enabled the observation of field-linked resonances and facilitated the creation of field-linked tetramers.These techniques advance the study of ultracold polar molecules and broaden the potential applications of MW tools in other platforms of quantum sciences."

Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment.

This paper examines how these inequalities manifest in northern Finland and Sweden, where sparse populations, long distances, and seasonal variations in demand create persistent gaps in service quality and reliability. Drawing on survey data (n = 148), in-depth interviews, and spatial analysis, the study explores the lived experience of connectivity in Arctic rural communities and introduces a novel Cellular Coverage Inequality (CCI) Index. The index combines measures of rurality and network performance to quantify spatial disparities that are masked by national coverage statistics. Results reveal that headline indicators overstate inclusiveness, while local users report chronic connectivity gaps affecting work, safety, and access to services. Building on these findings, the paper outlines policy reflections in six areas: shared infrastructure and roaming frameworks, spectrum flexibility for rural operators, performance-based Quality-of-Service monitoring, standardized and transparent reporting, temporal and seasonal capacity management, and digital-skills initiatives. Together, these recommendations highlight the need for multidimensional metrics and governance mechanisms that link technical performance, spatial equity, and user experience. The analysis contributes to ongoing debates on how broadband policy in sparsely populated regions can move beyond nominal coverage targets toward genuine inclusion and reliability."

In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability."

Low-cost, switch-based architectures have recently emerged as a potential alternative. However, prior studies rely on simplified models that ignore (among others) antenna coupling, radiation patterns, and matching losses, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions. In this paper, we use a physically consistent electromagnetic modeling framework to analyze an ultra-dense patch-antenna array architecture that performs joint beamforming and matching using networks of inexpensive RF switches. Our results demonstrate that simple, switch-based beamforming architectures can approach the antenna-gain of all-digital solutions at significantly lower cost and complexity."

    "abstract": "Soliton optical frequency combs have become key enablers for a wide range of applications, including telecommunications, optical atomic clocks, ultrafast distance measurements, dual-comb spectroscopy, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration, many of which benefit from low repetition rates. However, achieving such low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs is nontrivial as long cavities require substantially higher pump power, which induces stronger thermal effects that, in turn, exacerbate thermal instability and complicate access to stable soliton states. The dual-mode pumping scheme, in which a continuous-wave pump couples to both the comb-generating mode and an auxiliary mode, has proven simple and effective for mitigating thermal instability and enabling thermally accessible soliton generation. Yet, in long-cavity devices, the standard bus-to-resonator coupling conditions for these two modes diverge substantially, resulting in insufficient pump coupling to the auxiliary mode, which makes dual-mode pumping particularly challenging for low-repetition-rate microcombs. In this work, we overcome this limitation by coupling the pump to the auxiliary mode via inter-modal coupling, which can be introduced in racetrack microresonators and engineered by tailoring the cavity bend design. We validate this approach in a high-Q (>$10^7$) silicon nitride microresonator and demonstrate thermally accessible, deterministic single-soliton generation at a repetition rate of 33 GHz. This work provides a simple and robust pathway for generating low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs."

    "abstract": "Energy consumption is a growing concern in several fields, from mobile devices to large data centers. Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates."

In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

    "abstract": "We investigate the axial electromagnetic quasinormal modes of a static, asymptotically Anti--de Sitter (AdS) black hole sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics model of Plebański type. Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \\approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments."

However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer.

We solve this open problem by showing that unless the ETH fails, there is no algorithm solving the high-multiplicity Bin Packing problem in time ${{|I|}^2}^{o(d)}$. To prove this, we introduce a novel reduction from 3-SAT. The core of our construction is efficiently encoding the entire information from a 3-SAT instance with $n$ variables into an ILP with $O(\\log(n))$ variables.

    "abstract": "The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation."

    "abstract": "This paper employs modal analysis to study the core inertial dynamics of governor-controlled synchronous generators (GC-SG), droop-based grid-forming (GFM) converters, and their most fundamental interactions. The results indicate that even in the simplest cases, the prevailing industry paradigm of emulating legacy GC-SG behaviour in GFM converters (high inertia to slow down the system and large droop to increase damping) could be a suboptimal policy. It is shown that GC-SGs exhibit a fundamental trade-off: adequate damping of the turbine-governor mode requires large droop constants, inevitably increasing steady-state frequency deviation and dependence on secondary regulation. In contrast, droop-based GFM converters invert this relationship: decreasing the droop constant simultaneously reduces steady-state frequency deviations and increases damping, while allowing virtual inertia to be freely chosen. When two GC-SGs are coupled, the poorly damped electromechanical swing mode emerges. Results show that replacing one GC-SG with a GFM converter of equivalent droop and inertia already significantly improves damping of both swing and turbine-governor modes. Counter-intuitively, further and remarkable damping gains are achieved by substantially lowering the GFM virtual inertia constant. These findings suggest that current industry trends may be constraining the potential benefits of Inverter Based Resources (IBRs). Optimal stability and performance are instead obtained with low droop and low virtual inertia, yielding tightly bounded frequency variations and strongly-damped electromechanical modes. The results indicate a need to re-evaluate GFM control design principles and emerging grid-code requirements."

Yet, their practical implementation remains limited by the intrinsically weak optical nonlinearities of conventional materials, which demand high power and large footprints to achieve significant nonlinear responses. Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter excitations of semiconducting materials, offer a promising solution by combining strong optical nonlinearities with the high speed and large scalability typical of photonic devices. However, despite their potential, working on-chip polaritonic elements demonstrating room temperature coherent lasing, controllable nonlinear propagation, or amplification have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate a fully integrated perovskite polaritonic circuit that overcomes these limitations. Using a single-step microfluidic lithographic technique, we realize waveguide circuits with integrated gratings that simultaneously act as couplers and mirrors, forming in-plane Fabry-Pérot cavities. These structures support robust in-plane polariton lasing between gratings, yielding coherent emission along the waveguide. Furthermore, we observe clear signatures of strong nonlinear self-phase modulation and, for the first time, optical amplification of guided polaritons at room temperature. Our simple, scalable platform opens the way to low-power, highly nonlinear optical circuits for integrated photonics and neuromorphic architectures operating at room temperature."

    "abstract": "The recent rapid growth of visual generative models trained on vast web-scale datasets has created significant tension with data privacy regulations and copyright laws, such as GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten.'' This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner."

This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

Current progress focuses on integrating optical and electronic components into microfabricated ion traps to allow scaling to large numbers of ion qubits. Most available fabrication strategies for such integrated processors employ monolithic integration of all processor components and rely heavily on CMOS-compatible semiconductor fabrication technologies that are not optimized for the requirements of a trapped-ion quantum processor. In this work, we present a modular approach in which the processor modules, called chiplets, have specific functions and are fabricated separately. The individual chiplets are then combined using heterogeneous integration techniques. This strategy opens up the possibility of choosing the optimal materials and fabrication technology for each of the chiplets, with a minimum amount of fabrication limitations compared to the monolithic approach. Chiplet technology furthermore enables novel processor functionalities to be added in a cost-effective, modular fashion by adding or modifying only a subset of the chiplets. We describe the design concept of a chiplet-based trapped-ion quantum processor and demonstrate the technology with an example of an integrated individual-ion addressing system for a ten-ion crystal. The addressing system emphasizes the modularity of the chiplet approach, combining a surface ion trap manufactured on a glass substrate with a silicon substrate carrying integrated waveguides and a stack of 3D-printed micro-optics, achieving diffraction-limited focal spots at the ion positions."

This paper designs a communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithm for optimization problems subject to coupled equality constraints. While compressed communication is employed to enhance efficiency, it comes at the cost of introducing compression errors that may impair algorithm performance. To eliminate the influence of compression errors, differential compression techniques along with dynamic scaling factors are incorporated into the algorithm design.

    "abstract": "In the framework of data envelopment analysis, we review directional models \\citep{Chambers1996, Chambers1998, Briec1997} and show that they are inadequate when inputs and outputs are improved simultaneously under constant returns to scale. Conversely, we introduce a new family of quadratically constrained models with generalized orientation and demonstrate that these models overcome this limitation. Furthermore, we extend the Farrell measure of technical efficiency using these new models. Additionally, we prove that the family of generalized oriented models satisfies some desired monotonicity properties. Finally, we show that the new models, although being quadratically constrained, can be solved through linear programs in a fundamental particular case."

    "abstract": "Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence."

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics. Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

Compared to Si devices, they suffer from pronounced gate leakage due to the reduced electron tunneling barrier at the interface between SiC and amorphous silicon dioxide (a-SiO$_2$). We develop a self-consistent, physics-based simulation framework that couples electrostatics, quantum tunneling, carrier transport, impact ionization, and charge trapping for both electrons and holes. The model quantitatively reproduces measured gate-current-voltage characteristics of SiC MOS capacitors over a wide temperature (80-573 K) range and a wide bias range without empirical fitting. Simulations reveal that conduction electrons in a-SiO$_2$ can trigger impact ionization, which generates electron-hole pairs, and leads to capture of holes in the oxide bulk, thereby enhancing gate leakage current. The framework captures these coupled processes across multiple orders of magnitude in time and field, providing predictive capability for oxide reliability. Although demonstrated for SiC devices, the methodology also applies to Si technologies that uses the same gate dielectric."

This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf.

Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI).

Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures."

Recently, it has been implemented by the so called superconducting diode effect. Such effect arises from an imbalance in critical supercurrents flowing in opposite directions. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate how the superconducting diode effect emerges in the quantum spin Hall phase when brought into full proximity with a superconductor. We explore two regimes: large and narrow quantum wells. In the former geometry, we show that the superconducting diode effect can be externally controlled using both magnetic and electric fields, achieving unit efficiency. In the latter regime, where tunneling between opposite edges may occur, we propose a mechanism for an intrinsic superconducting diode effect driven by edge reconstruction, which does not require external magnetic fields."

We visually identify the 39 HCS crossings measured by PSP below 50~\\Rs~during encounters 6 to 21, and investigate the occurrence and properties of magnetic reconnection, the behavior of the spectral properties of the turbulent energy cascade, and the occurrence of kinetic instabilities at the HCS. We find that 82\\% of HCS crossings present signatures of reconnection jets, showing that the HCS is continuously reconnecting close to the Sun. The proportion of inward/outward jets depends on heliocentric distance, and the main HCS reconnection X-line has a higher probability of being located close to the Alfvén surface. We also observe a radial asymmetry in jet acceleration, where inward jets do not reach the local Alfvén speed, contrary to outward jets. We find that turbulence levels are enhanced in the ion kinetic range, consistent with the triggering of an inverse cascade by magnetic reconnection. Finally, we highlight the ubiquity of magnetic hole trains in the high $β$ environment of the HCS, showing that the mirror mode instability plays a key role in regulating the ion temperature anisotropy in HCS reconnection. Our findings shed new light on the properties of magnetic reconnection in the high $β$ plasma environment of the HCS, its interplay with the turbulent cascade and the role of the mirror mode instability."

Unlike physical robots, XR-native agents are unbound by hardware constraints and can be instantiated, adapted, and scaled on demand, while still affording embodiment and co-presence. We synthesize work across XR, HRI, and cognitive AI to show how such agents can support safety-critical scenarios, socially and cognitively empathic interaction across domains, and outreaching physical capabilities with XR and AI integration. We then discuss how multimodal large FMs (e.g., large language model, large vision model, and vision-language model) enable context-aware reasoning, affect-sensitive situations, and long-term adaptation, positioning virtual robots as cognitive and empathic mediators rather than mere simulation assets. At the same time, we highlight challenges and potential risks, including overtrust, cultural and representational bias, privacy concerns around biometric sensing, and data governance and transparency. The paper concludes by outlining a research agenda for human-centered, ethically grounded XR agents - emphasizing multi-layered evaluation frameworks, multi-user ecosystems, mixed virtual-physical embodiment, and societal and ethical design practices to envision XR-based virtual agents powered by FMs as reshaping future HRI into a more efficient and adaptive paradigm."

Such operators have recently attracted significant interest from the research community, including in the context of stochastic homogenization. In particular, it has been proved that the spectrum of these operators may feature a band-gap structure in the regime where heterogeneities take place on a sufficiently small scale. However, the nature of the limiting (as the small scale tends to zero) spectrum in the above setting is non-classical and not completely understood. In this paper we prove for the first time that Anderson localization occurs near band edges, thus shedding light on the limiting spectral behaviour. Our results rely on recent nontrivial advancements in quantitative unique continuation for PDEs, in combination with assumptions on the model that are standard in the Anderson localization literature, and which we plan to relax in future works."

In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods."

    "abstract": "In next-generation wireless communication systems, the newly designated upper mid-band has attracted considerable attention, also called frequency range 3 (FR3), highlighting the need for downlink (DL) transmission design, which fundamentally relies on accurate CSI. However, CSI acquisition in FR3 systems faces significant challenges: the increased number of antennas and wider transmission bandwidth introduces prohibitive training overhead with traditional estimation approaches, as each probing captures only incomplete spatial-frequency observation, while higher carrier frequencies lead to faster temporal channel variation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI acquisition framework that integrates CSI feedback, uplink (UL) and DL channel estimation, as well as channel prediction in the FR3 TDD massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we first develop the Joint UL and DL Channel Estimation Network (JUDCEN) to fuse incomplete observations based on the SRSs and CSI-RSs. By exploiting the complementary characteristics of preliminary UL and DL estimation features, obtained through initial UL estimation and quantized-feedback-assisted DL estimation, it enables full CSI reconstruction in the spatial domain. To mitigate the performance degradation in the feedback process, we propose the Transformer-MLP CSI Feedback Network (TMCFN), employing an MLP-based module to jointly exploit angle- and delay-domain features. Building upon the reconstructed full CSI, we further develop the Mamba-based Channel Prediction Network (MCPN), which exploits selective state-space model (SSM) mechanism to capture long-range temporal dynamics in the angle-delay domain for future CSI prediction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmarks in both CSI acquisition accuracy and transmission spectral efficiency with lower computational complexity."

Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection."

    "abstract": "The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs. However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\\textbf{2.5$\\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \\$0.059 to \\$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \\$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\\textbf{2$\\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy.

However, due to the refined division of labor, crowdsourcing laundering transactions exhibit diverse patterns and a polycentric structure, posing significant challenges for detection. In this paper, we introduce transaction group as auxiliary information, and propose the Multi-Task Collaborative Crowdsourcing Laundering Detection (MCCLD) framework. MCCLD employs an end-to-end graph neural network to realize collaboration between laundering transaction detection and transaction group detection tasks, enhancing detection performance on diverse patterns within crowdsourcing laundering group. These two tasks are jointly optimized through a shared classifier, with a shared feature encoder that fuses multi-level feature embeddings to provide rich transaction semantics and potential group information. Extensive experiments on both crowdsourcing and general laundering demonstrate MCCLD's effectiveness and generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on crowdsourcing laundering detection."

Such models must be accompanied by methods for estimating parameters in order to generate fast nowcasts and short-term forecasts that can inform public health decisions. This paper presents a comparison of two advanced Bayesian inference methods: 1) pseudo-marginal particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, short Particle Filters (PF), and 2) Conditional Normalizing Flows (CNF). We investigate their performance on two commonly used compartmental models: a classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and a two-variant Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model, complemented by an observation model that maps latent trajectories to empirical data. Addressing the challenges of intractable likelihoods for parameter inference in stochastic settings, our analysis highlights how these likelihood-free methods provide accurate and robust inference capabilities. The results of our simulation study further underscore the effectiveness of these approaches in capturing the stochastic dynamics of epidemics, providing prediction capabilities for the control of epidemic outbreaks. Results on an Ethiopian cohort study demonstrate operational robustness under real-world noise and irregular data sampling. To facilitate reuse and to enable building pipelines that ultimately contribute to better informed decision making in public health, we make code and synthetic datasets publicly available."

    "abstract": "This study presents a systematic estimation of the relativistic correction to the binding energies of two-body hadronic molecular states by comparing the numerical solutions of the three-dimensional (3D) Schr{ö}dinger, 3D Salpeter, and fully relativistic four-dimensional (4D) Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equations derived from the same underlying interaction. The numerical results reveal a counter-intuitive property: for hadronic molecular states whose binding energies are in the MeV range, the relativistic correction is unexpectedly large. This finding contradicts the conventional expectation that a heavier exchanged mass in the interaction implies suppressed relativistic effects. Specifically, we first benchmark the results using the Wick-Cutkosky model with a one-boson-exchange (OBE) interaction of mass $m_{ex}$, and then extend the analysis to the physical $D\\bar{D}$ system. We find within the $1\\sim 50$ MeV binding energy region, the relativistic correction is substantial, amounting to $-90\\% \\sim -70\\%$ of the non-relativistic result. Such a significant correction strongly suggests that analyses based solely on the 3D Schr{ö}dinger or 3D Salpeter equations for hadronic molecular states should be treated with caution."

    "abstract": "The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing."

    "abstract": "Earables, such as True Wireless Stereo earphones and VR/AR headsets, are increasingly popular, yet their compact design poses challenges for robust voice-related applications like telecommunication and voice assistant interactions in noisy environments. Existing speech enhancement systems, reliant solely on omnidirectional microphones, struggle with ambient noise like competing speakers. To address these issues, we propose VibOmni, a lightweight, end-to-end multi-modal speech enhancement system for earables that leverages bone-conducted vibrations captured by widely available Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). VibOmni integrates a two-branch encoder-decoder deep neural network to fuse audio and vibration features. To overcome the scarcity of paired audio-vibration datasets, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique that models Bone Conduction Functions (BCFs) from limited recordings, enabling synthetic vibration data generation with only 4.5% spectrogram similarity error. Additionally, a multi-modal SNR estimator facilitates continual learning and adaptive inference, optimizing performance in dynamic, noisy settings without on-device back-propagation. Evaluated on real-world datasets from 32 volunteers with different devices, VibOmni achieves up to 21% improvement in Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), 26% in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and about 40% WER reduction with much less latency on mobile devices. A user study with 35 participants showed 87% preferred VibOmni over baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for deployment in diverse acoustic environments."

We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks."

Based on the measurement data, this paper compares the channel capacity of CF-mMIMO and Conventional mMIMO under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions across a range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We then analyze how channel capacity varies with Rx positions from the perspectives of the full array and of individual subarrays. Finally, we conclude that the 64-element array configuration yields the greatest advantage in channel capacity for CF-mMIMO in the measurement environment considered, with gains of 14.02\\% under LOS and 24.61\\% under NLOS conditions. This in-depth analysis of channel capacity in the FR3 band provides critical insights for optimizing CF-mMIMO systems in next generation wireless networks."

    "abstract": "Stochastic models of biochemical reaction networks are widely used to capture intrinsic noise in cellular systems. The typical formulation of these models are based on Markov processes for which there is extensive research on efficient simulation and inference. However, there are biological processes, such as gene transcription and translation, that introduce history dependent dynamics requiring non-Markovian processes to accurately capture the stochastic dynamics of the system. This greater realism comes with additional computational challenges for simulation and parameter inference. We develop efficient stochastic simulation algorithms for well-mixed non-Markovian stochastic biochemical reaction networks with delays that depend on system state and time. Our methods generalize the next reaction method and $τ$-leaping method to support arbitrary inter-event time distributions while preserving computational scalability. We also introduce a coupling scheme to generate exact non-Markovian sample paths that are positively correlated to an approximate non-Markovian $τ$-leaping sample path. This enables substantial computational gains for Bayesian inference of model parameters though multifidelity simulation-based inference schemes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a gene regulation model with delayed auto-inhibition, showing substantial gains in both simulation accuracy and inference efficiency of two orders of magnitude. These results extend the practical applicability of non-Markovian models in systems biology and beyond."

    "abstract": "The automated design of parameterized quantum circuits for variational algorithms in the NISQ era faces a fundamental limitation, as conventional differentiable architecture search relies on classical models that fail to adequately represent quantum gate interactions under hardware noise. We introduce the Quantum-Based Self-Attention for Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (QBSA-DQAS), a meta-learning framework featuring quantum-based self-attention and hardware-aware multi-objective search. The framework employs a two-stage quantum self-attention module that computes contextual dependencies by mapping architectural parameters through parameterized quantum circuits, replacing classical similarity metrics with quantum-derived attention scores, then applies position-wise quantum transformations for feature enrichment. Architecture search is guided by a task-agnostic multi-objective function jointly optimizing noisy expressibility and Probability of Successful Trials (PST). A post-search optimization stage applies gate commutation, fusion, and elimination to reduce circuit complexity. Experimental validation demonstrates superior performance on VQE tasks and large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks. For VQE on H$_2$, QBSA-DQAS achieves 0.9 accuracy compared to 0.89 for standard DQAS. Post-search optimization reduces discovered circuit complexity by up to 44% in gate count and 47% in depth without accuracy degradation. The framework maintains robust performance across three molecules and five IBM quantum hardware noise models. For WSN routing, discovered circuits achieve 8.6% energy reduction versus QAOA and 40.7% versus classical greedy methods, establishing the effectiveness of quantum-native architecture search for NISQ applications."

In the considered system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate within a structured air corridor composed of connected cubic segments, and multiple BSs need to be selectively deployed at a set of candidate locations to ensure both sensing and communication coverage throughout the corridor. In particular, we leverage the channel knowledge map (CKM) to characterize wireless channels for candidate BS sites prior to deployment, thereby facilitating the offline planning. Under this setup, we minimize the system cost in terms of the weighted sum of the air corridor length and the number of deployed BSs, subject to the constraints on both sensing and communication performance across the corridor. To solve the formulated large-scale nonconvex integer programming problem, we develop a hierarchical coarse-to-fine grid decomposition algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed joint design in reducing the overall deployment cost while ensuring the coverage of the low-altitude ISAC networks."

Time-to-first-spike (TTFS)-coded spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution, as each neuron emits at most one binary spike, resulting in extremely sparse and energy-efficient computation. While prior works have primarily focused on improving TTFS SNN training algorithms, the impact of network architecture has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose TNAS-ER, the first neural architecture search (NAS) framework tailored to TTFS SNNs for eye-based emotion recognition. TNAS-ER presents a novel ANN-assisted search strategy that leverages a ReLU-based ANN counterpart sharing an identity mapping with the TTFS SNN to guide architecture optimization. TNAS-ER employs an evolutionary algorithm, with weighted and unweighted average recall jointly defined as fitness objectives for emotion recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TNAS-ER achieves high recognition performance with significantly improved efficiency. Furthermore, when deployed on neuromorphic hardware, TNAS-ER attains a low latency of 48 ms and an energy consumption of 0.05 J, confirming its superior energy efficiency and strong potential for practical applications."

Traditional join discovery methods are largely designed for equi-joins, which assume that join keys match exactly or nearly so. These techniques, while efficient in clean, well-normalized databases, fail in open or federated settings where identifiers are inconsistently formatted, embedded, or split across multiple columns. Approximate or fuzzy joins alleviate minor string variations but cannot capture systematic transformations. We introduce QJoin, a reinforcement-learning framework that learns and reuses transformation strategies across join tasks. QJoin trains an agent under a uniqueness-aware reward that balances similarity with key distinctiveness, enabling it to explore concise, high-value transformation chains. To accelerate new joins, we introduce two reuse mechanisms: (i) agent transfer, which initializes new policies from pretrained agents, and (ii) transformation reuse, which caches successful operator sequences for similar column clusters. On the AutoJoin Web benchmark (31 table pairs), QJoin achieves an average F1-score of 91.0%. For 19,990 join tasks in NYC+Chicago open datasets, Qjoin reduces runtime by up to 7.4% (13,747 s) by using reusing. These results demonstrate that transformation learning and reuse can make join discovery both more accurate and more efficient."

The interior spacetime is smoothly matched with the exterior geometry calculated from the theoretical setup of $f(Q)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity using the Darmois-Israel junction conditions, ensuring the continuity of the metric functions and their derivatives at the stellar boundary. The physical viability of the model is examined through regularity, energy, and causality conditions, all of which are satisfied throughout the stellar interior. The study highlights how the pressure anisotropy, the propagation speeds of sound, and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff balance condition are interconnected, showing that the star remains in mechanical equilibrium only when the gravitational, hydrostatic, electric, and anisotropic contributions counterbalance one another appropriately. The dynamical stability of the configuration is further supported by the requirement $Γ> \\tfrac{4}{3}$ for the adiabatic index, indicating resilience against small radial perturbations. The plots of compactness, surface redshift, and the mass--radius profiles confirm that all physical quantities behave regularly and vary smoothly throughout the stellar interior.

Pushing into the sub-0.1mm regime is required to probe ultra-slow tidal dissipation, long-period librations, uHz-band gravitational waves. We develop a complete amplitude-modulated continuous-wave (AM-CW) framework for high-power LLR, including measurement models, estimators, a unified covariance description, and an observatory CONOPS. CW LLR is treated as RF phase metrology on a bright CW optical carrier: 2-way range and 1-way line-of-sight range-rate obtained from the phase and phase slope of a GHz-class modulation tone. The joint estimators are characterized by a covariance matrix decomposed into photon, atmospheric, instrumental, oscillator, nonlinearity contributions, mapped into subsystem requirements, including a closed-form range-rate bias from modulation-frequency slew across the ~2.56s round trip and synthetic-wavelength constraints on multi-tone nonlinearity. Using realistic photon budgets for a 1 kW, 1064 nm CW transmitter on a 1-m telescope ranging to 10cm corner-cube retroreflectors, we show that the photon-statistical floor for 2-way range at a GHz-class modulation frequency is at the level of a few-10 um in ~100s. With allocations to residual atmosphere and instrument, the resulting single-station 2-way precision is ~80 um, with range-rate sensitivities of ~0.1-1 um/s. Differential LLR between reflectors separated on the Moon by ~1000km can deliver 20-50 um and few (0.1-1) um/s differential range and range-rate. These precisions are realized across three representative regimes that span detected photon rates of (5-7) x 10^3-10^5 s^{-1} and are translated directly into hardware and CONOPS requirements for next-generation high-power AM-CW LLR."

A key challenge in this domain is the encoding of input data, which plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of QML models. In this work, we tackle a largely unaddressed aspect of encoding that is unique to QML modeling -- rather than adjusting the ansatz used for encoding, we consider adjusting how data is conveyed to the ansatz. We specifically implement QML pipelines that leverage classical data manipulation (i.e., ordering, selecting, and weighting features) as a preprocessing step, and evaluate if these aspects of encoding can have a significant impact on QML model performance, and if they can be effectively optimized to improve performance. Our experimental results, applied across a wide variety of data sets, ansatz, and circuit sizes, with a representative QML approach, demonstrate that by optimizing how features are encoded in an ansatz we can substantially and consistently improve the performance of QML models, making a compelling case for integrating these techniques in future QML applications. Finally we demonstrate the practical feasibility of this approach by running it using real quantum hardware with 100 qubit circuits and successfully achieving improved QML modeling performance in this case as well."

In Type-1.5 systems, Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) dynamics generate complex, glassy vortex patterns with high metastability. We explicitly quantify this intractability by analyzing the Hessian spectrum of the energy landscape, revealing a proliferation of soft modes that hinders traditional sampling. We address this challenge by combining a differentiable TDGL solver with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). Our approach treats the solver as a stochastic forward model mapping physical parameters (θ = (η, B, ν)) to vortex density fields. Using Neural Ratio Estimation (NRE), we train a classifier to approximate the likelihood-to-evidence ratio and perform Bayesian inference for the interband Josephson coupling from vortex density fields. On synthetic data, the proposed method reliably recovers the coupling with calibrated uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs, have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance. However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment. Sparsity offers a promising solution, yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention, while few consider inter-row sparsity. Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation, which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity, and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components. Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow, we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead. Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT, an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers. ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism, which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation, achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components. To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations. Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss. ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W, and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively."

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are a core component of blockchain technology and are widely deployed across various scenarios. However, atomicity violations have become a potential security risk. Existing analysis tools often lack the precision required to detect these issues effectively. To address this challenge, we introduce AtomGraph, an automated framework designed for detecting atomicity violations. This framework leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to identify atomicity violations through multimodal feature learning and fusion. Specifically, driven by a collaborative learning mechanism, the model simultaneously learns from two heterogeneous modalities: extracting structural topological features from the contract's Control Flow Graph (CFG) and uncovering deep semantics from its opcode sequence. We designed an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism to dynamically adjust the weights of features from each modality to achieve optimal feature fusion. Finally, GCN detects graph-level atomicity violation on the contract. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that AtomGraph achieves 96.88% accuracy and 96.97% F1 score, outperforming existing tools. Furthermore, compared to the concatenation fusion model, AtomGraph improves the F1 score by 6.4%, proving its potential in smart contract security detection."

To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation (\"thinking with images\"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning."

In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance."

    "abstract": "We have applied our approach of using ''SNe Ia twins''in the Hubble flow to obtain distances to SNe Ia at z $>$ 0.015 and derive H$_{0}$. Our results, taking a single step between the low z domain and the Hubble flow, validate the three rung classical method. We find, however, that the full compilation of distances, both in Pantheon+ and in the Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP), contain some inaccurate values in the colors due to an underestimate of reddening by dust. This produces odd individual values for H$_{0}$ from single SNe Ia. On the average, those erroneous estimates do not affect the mean value of H$_{0}$, which is characterized by the bulk of well--modeled SNe Ia. Our sample of carefully addressed SNe Ia in the Hubble flow contains a dozen supernovae, for which the distances are determined with high accuracy. Three of these SNe Ia are of the Broad Line subtype and can be compared with SN 1989B in M66, a host galaxy with a unique convergence of the Cepheid distance determination and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars (TRGB) determination by the CCHP group. They point to a weighted average of H$_{0}$ $=$ 73.556 $\\pm$ 2.084 (stat) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc $^{-1}$. There is as well a very good agreement on the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 5643 between those derived with Cepheids by SH0ES and those derived with the use of J-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (JAGB stars) by the CCHP, which makes them very good anchors. The sample of 12 SNe Ia gives a value of H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.833 $\\pm$ 1.306(stat) $\\pm$ 1.151 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in Cepheids, and of H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.388 $\\pm$ 1.272 (stat) $\\pm$ 1.015 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in JAGBs by the CCHP.

    "abstract": "The first experiments in dynamic rotational diamond anvil cell (dRDAC) on severe plastic deformation (SPD) and BCC<->HCP phase transformation (PT) at pressure up to 27.6 GPa, rotation rates up to 1,500 RPM, and strain rates up to 2,094 /s are performed considering Fe-%7Mn alloy as an example. The BCC-HCP PT initiates at 11.4 GPa under hydrostatic loading while it is 3.2 GPa under plastic compression. Strong effect of plastic straining leads to unique kinetics with simultaneous direct and reverse PTs, not studied for any material. For quasi-static loading, parameters in the kinetics for the strain-induced direct-reverse PTs and stationary volume fraction versus pressure are found. During torsion with 1,000 and 1,500 RPM, volume fraction of the HCP phase does not change. After torsion stops, it increases by 30% within a few minutes after 1,000 RPM and HCP phase disappears after 1,500 RPM. These findings contradict general wisdom that strain-induced PTs occur only during straining, time is not a governing parameter, and kinetics is determined by plastic strain instead of time. Thus, nuclei of the HCP phase are generated during straining at high strain rate, but growth/disappearance occur under stresses at much longer time scales. Consequently, a new theory of combined strain- and stress-induced PTs is required. The following important rule is revealed: crystallite size of 30 nm, microstrain ~0.004, and dislocation density ~1.1 x $10^{15}$/$m^2$ in the HCP phase are steady during static compression and dynamic torsion, during and after the PT and after torsion. These parameters are independent of pressure, plastic strain tensor, its path, strain rates, and volume fraction of the HCP phase. Obtained results open fundamental research on combined strain- and stress-induced PTs and microstructure evolution under dynamic SPD and high pressure."

We implement the sc-RPA calculation for the one-dimensional spinless fermion model in the parameter regime of disordered ground state, with the N-representability constraints enforced. The obtained ground state energy, correlation function, and density spectral function agree well with existing results. The features of the Luttinger liquid ground state and the continuum/bound state in the spectral function are well captured.

    "abstract": "Tensor accelerators now represent a growing share of compute resources in modern CPUs and GPUs. However, they are hard to program, leading developers to use vendor-provided kernel libraries that support tensor accelerators. As a result, the usage of tensor accelerators is limited to the provided interface, mainly designed for traditional ML and scientific computing workloads. In this paper, we show that tensor accelerators can improve the performance of applications beyond simple variants of MatMul. For example, many image processing pipelines are linear transformations over matrices in disguise and can therefore utilize such specialized hardware. This is nonetheless hindered by the difficulties in programming tensor accelerators. We tackle this problem with compiler-based techniques. We use the Halide user-schedulable language and express operations as Halide algorithms succinctly. To this end, we implement a flexible tensor instruction selector based on equality saturation. The tensor instruction selector supports both CPU- and GPU-attached tensor accelerators and works with existing scheduling operations (e.g., producer-consumer fusion). Together, this enables developers to write diverse accelerator-leveraging applications in a few dozen lines. Using our system, we demonstrate the potential of tensor accelerators beyond their traditional domains. We implement several image processing pipelines (e.g., filtering, resampling, and denoising) in our system and evaluate them against non-accelerator-leveraging baselines. We show that these pipelines can achieve significant speedups. For example, a downsampling routine is sped up by $6.1\\times$ by utilizing Tensor Cores on an Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU."

Furthermore, we show that this upper bound scales as the square of the product of the inverse temperature and the evolution time. In the low-temperature limit, we establish an additional upper bound expressed as the seminorm of the commutator divided by the energy gap. We apply this thermal dynamic sensing scheme to various models, demonstrating that the dynamic quantum Fisher information satisfies the established upper bounds."

For each time point, we compute the maximal forward and backward visibility distances, $L^{+}(t)$ and $L^{-}(t)$, and use their empirical distributions to build a visibility-asymmetry fingerprint comprising the Kolmogorov--Smirnov distance, variance difference, entropy difference, and a ratio of extreme visibility spans. In a Monte Carlo study, these HVG asymmetry features sharply separate volatility-clustered GARCH(1,1) dynamics from i.i.d.\\ Gaussian noise and from randomly shuffled GARCH series that preserve the marginal distribution but destroy temporal dependence; a simple linear classifier based on the fingerprint achieves about 90\\% in-sample accuracy. Applying the method to daily S\\&P500 data reveals a pronounced forward--backward imbalance, including a variance difference $Δ\\mathrm{Var}$ that exceeds the simulated GARCH values by two orders of magnitude and vanishes after shuffling. Overall, the visibility-graph asymmetry fingerprint emerges as a simple, model-free, and geometrically interpretable indicator of volatility clustering and time irreversibility in financial time series."

For zero feedback under the generate-at-will traffic, we derive a closed-form lower bound of achievable AoI, which, to the best of our knowledge, reflects the impact of zero feedback for the first time, and propose a policy that achieves this bound in many cases by jointly applying rate splitting and modular arithmetic. For zero feedback under the Bernoulli traffic, we develop a drift-plus-penalty (DPP) policy with a threshold structure based on the theory of Lyapunov optimization and provide a closed-form performance guarantee. Furthermore, we extend the design of this DPP policy to support general imperfect feedback without increasing the online computational complexity. Numerical results verify our theoretical analysis and the AoI advantage of the proposed policies over state-of-the-art policies."

    "abstract": "Estimating divergence times from molecular sequence data is central to reconstructing the evolutionary history of lineages. Although Bayesian relaxed-clock methods provide a principled framework for incorporating fossil information, their dependence on repeated evaluations of the full phylogenetic likelihood makes them computationally demanding for large genomic datasets. Furthermore, because disagreements in divergence-time estimates often arise from uncertainty or error in fossil placement and prior specification, there is a need for methods that are both computationally efficient and robust to fossil-calibration uncertainty. In this study, we introduce fast and accurate alternatives based on the phylogenetic pairwise composite likelihood, presenting two adjusted pairwise likelihood (APW) formulations that employ asymptotic moment-matching weights to better approximate the behavior of the full likelihood within a Bayesian MCMC framework. Extensive simulations across diverse fossil-calibration scenarios show that APW methods produce node-age estimates comparable to those obtained from the full likelihood while offering greater robustness to fossil misplacement and prior misspecification, due to the reduced sensitivity of composite likelihoods to local calibration errors. Applied to a genome-scale dataset of modern birds, APW methods recover divergence time patterns consistent with recent studies, while reducing computational cost by more than an order of magnitude. Overall, our results demonstrate that adjusted pairwise likelihoods provide a calibration-robust and computationally efficient framework for Bayesian node dating, especially suited for large phylogenomic datasets and analyses in which fossil priors may be uncertain or imperfectly placed."

Previous large-scale atomistic simulations have provided mechanistic insight, but their accuracy and achievable model complexity remain constrained by the available interatomic potentials. Here, we present an end-to-end workflow for developing accurate and efficient machine-learning potentials, specifically moment tensor potentials (MTPs), tailored for structurally and chemically complex systems such as metallosilicates. The workflow integrates de novo structure generation, surface functionalization, and property evaluation. A domain-specific training strategy is employed: Configurations associated with melt--quench generation and subsequent functionalization train the syn-MTP, whereas configurations near equilibrium train the eq-MTP. We apply the workflow to prototypical metallosilicates, i.e., aluminosilicates, which we also experimentally synthesize and characterize for benchmarking the simulations. The syn-MTP reliably generates amorphous aluminosilicates that match experimental density and pair distribution functions measured with synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The eq-MTP reproduces experimental infrared spectra and surface hydroxyl densities, along with density-functional-theory-derived dehydrogenation energies, demonstrating meta-GGA-level accuracy and validating the end-to-end workflow. Finally, we showcase the applicability of the developed potentials by predicting infrared spectra of functionalized porous aluminosilicates. This study establishes a robust path toward accurate modeling of realistic metallosilicates under operando-relevant conditions."

    "abstract": "Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development."

    "abstract": "The formation channels of binary neutron stars (BNSs) remain uncertain. The detection of GW190425 by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) suggests a subpopulation of massive BNSs, possibly formed through unstable \"case BB\" mass transfer with short merger delays. We investigate whether next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) can identify and characterise such subpopulations. Using the latest LVK constraints on the BNS merger rate, we generate mock ET catalogues containing a mixture of light and heavy subpopulations. The redshift distribution of each subpopulation is modeled as the convolution of the cosmic star formation rate with a time-delay distribution: heavy BNSs have fixed short delays, while light BNSs follow power-law delays with indices -0.5,-1,-1.5. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses are then performed on catalogues of 100-5,000 events. With hundreds of detections from ET, we will be able to establish that the total mass distribution is bimodal. A few thousand events are sufficient to disentangle the redshift distributions of the two subpopulations for moderate time-delay indices (-0.5 or -1). For steeper indices (-1.5), the differences are more subtle, requiring larger catalogues, beyond what we could explore given our computational resources. Next-generation detectors should enable the detection of multiple BNS subpopulations and their redshift evolution, providing valuable insight into their formation pathways."

We analyze the magnetic field uniformity and phase linearity of these configurations using Biot-Savart simulations. Our results show that both the double-wound and discrete loop designs offer similar improvements over the simple twisted solenoid with return wire. The discrete loop pattern requires less wire than the double-wound version, making it the preferred option for practical coil construction and operation in a TRASE MRI system."

Cracks on the surface and within the bulk material were identified across the entire gauge region of the specimens. The susceptibility of GBs to crack initiation and propagation was evaluated by separating cracks containing single GB or multiple GBs. A larger loss in fracture strain, a smaller reduction in area, and an increase in the percentage of intergranular fracture indicated a higher degree of embrittlement at elevated hydrogen concentrations. The number of cracks was significantly higher on the surface than in the bulk for the most severe hydrogen charging conditions ($\\geq$ 8 wppm), while a similar number was observed for lower concentrations. The propensity for hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking at different types of GBs on the surface and in the bulk material was consistent, indicating that while cathodic charging can promote surface cracks, it does not significantly impact the GBs relative susceptibility. The $Σ$-3 boundaries were the most resistant to cracking, as evidenced by the considerably lower fraction of these GBs exhibiting intergranular cracking at all hydrogen concentrations considered. This contrasts literature findings for Ni alloys and can be explained by the segregation energies and reductions in the cohesive strength with hydrogen, with less favorable trapping at the $Σ$-3 boundaries. No evidence of plasticity-mediated cracking initiation was observed."

With this augmentation we introduce two different, well-conditioned, and easy to solve matrices to approximate the trace pressure Schur complement. To introduce a completely algebraic solver, we propose to use multifrontal sparse LU solvers using butterfly compression to solve the trace velocity block. Numerical examples demonstrate that the trace pressure Schur complement is highly robust in mesh spacing and Reynolds number and that the multifrontal inexact LU performs well for a wide range of Reynolds numbers."

Lumos is an imperative probabilistic programming DSL over graphs, with constructs to generate independent and identically distributed prompts for LMS. It offers a structured view of prompt distributions via graphs, forming random prompts from sampled subgraphs. Lumos supports certifying LMS for arbitrary prompt distributions via integration with statistical certifiers. We provide hybrid (operational and denotational) semantics for Lumos, providing a rigorous way to interpret the specifications. Using only a small set of composable constructs, Lumos can encode existing LMS specifications, including complex relational and temporal specifications. It also facilitates specifying new properties - we present the first safety specifications for vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving scenarios developed with Lumos. Using these, we show that the state-of-the-art VLM Qwen-VL exhibits critical safety failures, producing incorrect and unsafe responses with at least 90% probability in right-turn scenarios under rainy driving conditions, revealing substantial safety risks. Lumos's modular structure allows easy modification of the specifications, enabling LMS certification to stay abreast with the rapidly evolving threat landscape. We further demonstrate that specification programs written in Lumos enable finding specific failure cases exhibited by state-of-the-art LMS. Lumos is the first systematic and extensible language-based framework for specifying and certifying LMS behaviors, paving the way for a wider adoption of LMS certification."

The inferred gas profiles are more extended and the power suppression is stronger than predicted by the fiducial models of recent hydrodynamical simulation suites, including FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS.

Similarly to the traditional matching distance, the convex matching distance aggregates the information provided by two real-valued components. However, whereas the matching distance depends on two parameters, the convex matching distance depends on only one, offering improved computational efficiency. We further show that the convex matching distance can be more discriminative than the traditional matching distance in certain cases, although the two metrics are generally not comparable. Moreover, we prove that the convex matching distance is stable and characterize the coefficients of the convex combination at which it is attained. Finally, we demonstrate that this new aggregation framework benefits from the computational advantages provided by the Pareto grid, a collection of curves in the plane whose points lie in the image of the Pareto critical set associated with functions assuming values on the real plane."

Similar modulations may also arise from orbital eccentricity, raising the possibility of degeneracies that could lead to false microlensing claims. We investigate the extent to which eccentric binary black hole (BBH) signals can mimic microlensing signatures produced by an isolated point-mass lens. With a simulated population of eccentric signals using numerical relativity simulations and \\texttt{TEOBResumS-Dalí} waveform model, we perform a Bayesian model-comparison study, supported by a complementary \\textit{mismatch} analysis. We find a strong degeneracy for high eccentricities, low total masses, and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs): under these conditions, quasicircular microlensed model can be strongly favored over quasicircular unlensed model, even when the true signal is unlensed. For moderate SNRs ($\\sim 30$), binaries with $M_\\mathrm{tot}\\lesssim 100\\,M_\\odot$ and eccentricity $e \\gtrsim 0.4$ are particularly susceptible to misclassifications. In such cases, inferred microlens parameters exhibit well-constrained posteriors despite being unphysical. Crucially, the degeneracy is completely removed when the recovery uses waveform models that incorporate eccentricity, which overwhelmingly favors the eccentric hypothesis over microlensing. Our results demonstrate that any event exhibiting strong Bayesian evidence for microlensing should also be analyzed with eccentric waveform models and vice-versa to avoid false positives and biased astrophysical inference. This work contributes to developing robust strategies for interpreting signals in the era of precision GW astronomy."

A sailboat evaporator with a root-like structure is a new system that enables wind-assisted interfacial evaporation of concentrated particle slurries. In this work, we create access to the disconnected water pockets in concentrated slurry waste, facilitating faster water conduction and efficient evaporation at extremely high solid concentration. The evaporator's long roots effectively extracted water beneath 150 cm deep supernatant water layer. Through replantation of the evaporator to a separate location, an impressive evaporation rate (ER) of 4 kg/(m^2*h) close to 80 wt% solid concentration, a 25% increase to a non-replanted sample. Furthermore, long periods of efficient of evaporation was achieved even at high solid concentration through hydrodynamic flushing of roots. Outdoor experiments achieved substantial volumetric reduction, yielding dried residues with over 75 wt% solid concentration. These results underscore the system's reliable performance against highly concentrated slurries, yet to be by conventional industrial methods, including flocculation and tail-lift drying. The integration of renewable energy coupled with efficient enhancement techniques makes the sailboat evaporator a scalable and sustainable pathway for industrial wastewater dewatering."

    "abstract": "We study the quantum dynamics generated by the repeated action of a non-unitary evolution operator on a system of qubits. Breaking unitarity can lead to the purification of mixed initial states, which corresponds to the loss of sensitivity to initial conditions, and hence the absence of a key signature of dynamical chaos. However, the scrambling of quantum information can delay purification to times that are exponential in system size. Here we study purification in systems whose evolution operators are fixed in time, where all aspects of the dynamics are in principle encoded in spectral properties of the evolution operator for a single time step. The operators that we study consist of global Haar random unitary operators and non-unitary single-qubit operations. We show that exponentially slow purification arises from a distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane that forms a ring with sharp edges at large radii, with the eigenvalue density exponentially large near these edges. We argue that the sharp edges of the eigenvalue distribution arise from level attraction along the radial direction in the complex plane. By calculating the spectral form factor we also show that there is level repulsion around the azimuthal direction, even close to the outer edge of the ring of eigenvalues. Our results connect this spectral signature of quantum chaos to the sensitivity of the system to its initial conditions."

While RPS affects recently formed stars by displacing the gas disk from which they form, gravitational interactions perturb stars of all ages rather similarly. We present the first observational test of the Size-Shape Difference (SSD) measure, a novel approach validated for simulated galaxies, that quantifies morphological differences between young and intermediate-age stellar populations to distinguish RPS from gravitationally interacting galaxies. We analyze 67 galaxies from the GASP survey using spatially-resolved star formation histories derived using SINOPSIS. In our fiducial model, we compare stellar populations in two age bins (t < 20 Myr and 20 Myr <= t < 570 Myr) to calculate SSD values. The sample includes confirmed RPS cases with different stripping intensities, as well as undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies. We find that extreme cases of RPS show SSD values ~3.5x higher than undisturbed and gravitationally interacting galaxies (56(+24/-15) as compared to 16(+6/-2) and 16(+6/-3), respectively), confirming simulation predictions. This enhancement reflects RPS-induced asymmetries: youngest stars are compressed along the leading edge and/or displaced into the extended tails of cold gas, while older populations remain undisturbed. In contrast, gravitational interactions perturb all stars uniformly, producing lower SSD values. SSD robustly distinguishes strong RPS cases, even adopting different age bins. This holds even without correcting for disk inclination, or when single-band imaging are used to trace stellar distributions. This makes SSD a promising tool to select RPS candidates for spectroscopic follow-up in upcoming surveys."

    "abstract": "Move is a research-oriented programming language design for secure and verifiable smart contract development and has been widely used in managing billions of digital assets in blockchains, such as Sui and Aptos. Move features a strong static type system and explicit resource semantics to enforce safety properties such as the prevention of data races, invalid asset transfers, and entry vulnerabilities. However, smart contracts written in Move may still contain certain vulnerabilities that are beyond the reach of its type system. It is thus essential to validate Move smart contracts. Unfortunately, due to its strong type system, existing smart contract fuzzers are ineffective in producing syntactically or semantically valid transactions to test Move smart contracts. This paper introduces the first fuzzing framework, Belobog, for Move smart contracts. Belobog is type-aware and ensures that all generated and mutated transactions are well-typed. More specifically, for a target Move smart contract, Belobog first constructs a type graph based on Move's type system, and then generates or mutates a transaction based on the graph trace derived from the type graph. In order to overcome the complex checks in Move smart contracts, we further design and implement a concolic executor in Belobog. We evaluated Belobog on 109 real-world Move smart contract projects. The experimental results show that Belobog is able to detect 100\\% critical and 79\\% major vulnerabilities manually audited by human experts. We further selected two recent notorious incidents in Move smart contracts, i.e., Cetus and Nemo. Belobog successfully reproduced full exploits for both of them, without any prior knowledge."

However, minimizing these variables is desirable to reduce patient radiation exposure and radiopharmaceutical costs. PETfectior is an artificial intelligence-based software that processes PET scans and increases signal-to-noise ratio, obtaining high-quality images from low-count-rate images. We perform an initial clinical validation of PETfectior on images acquired with half of the counting statistics required to meet the most recent EANM quantitative standards for 18F-FDG PET, evaluating lesions detectability, quantitative performance and image quality. Materials and methods: 258 patients referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT were prospectively included. The standard-of-care scans (100% scans) were acquired and reconstructed according to EARL standards 2. Half-counting-statistics versions were generated from list-mode data and processed with PETfecftior (50%+PETfectior scans). All oncologic lesions were segmented on both PET/CT versions, manually or automatically, and lesions detectability was evaluated. The SUVmax of the lesions was measured and the quantitative concordance of 50%+PETfectior and 100% images was evaluated. Subjective image quality was visually assessed by two experienced physicians. Results: 1649 lesions were detected in a total of 198 studies. The 50%+PETfectior images showed high sensitivity for lesion detection (99.9%) and only 1 false positive was detected. The SUVmax measured in 100% and 50%+PETfectior images agreed within 12.5% (95% limits of agreement), with a bias of -1.01%. Image quality of the 50%+PETfectior images was rated equal to or better than the standard-of-care images. Conclusion: PETfectior can safely be used in clinical practice at half counting statistics, with high sensitivity and specificity, low quantitative bias and high subjective image quality."

By combining causal discovery, causal interventions, and first-principles simulations, we identify tolerance factor, A-site cation radii mismatch, epitaxial strain, and octahedral rotation/tilt as key parameters and quantify how their interplay directly influences switching barrier. Three key insights emerge from our work: (a) the analysis identifies the structural descriptors controlling polarization reversal across a broad family of A-site-layered double perovskites and superlattices, (b) it uncovers non-trivial, material-specific rotation-tilt mechanisms, including a counterintuitive cooperative pathway where both rotation and tilt change while lowering the barrier, an effect mostly inaccessible to conventional Landau or first-principles-based approaches and (c) it maps these material-specific mechanisms to experimentally realizable parameters, showing that epitaxial strain from orthorhombic substrates (e.g., NdScO$_3$, NdGaO$_3$) selectively tunes octahedral distortions to achieve barrier reduction across varied compositions. These results establish actionable, materials-by-design principles linking composition, structure, and strain to polarization switching, while highlighting the potential of causal reasoning to guide intelligent, mechanism-driven strategies for engineering complex functional oxides."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an analysis of the performance of a Gaussian optical beam as it propagates through the turbulent underwater optical channel (UWOC) under the weak turbulence regime, where optical signal experiences significant fading and scattering, all of which can severely degrade communication quality. It is assumed that on-off keying (OOK) modulation with direct detection is utilized to establish a duplex communication link. A multi-wavelength beam approach is implemented to enhance the performance by leveraging the distinct propagation characteristics of different wavelengths. Performance is established in terms of the probability of fade, number of fade per second, mean fade duration, and mean time between fades. The use of multi-wavelength beam is shown to enhance performance by a sizable margin."

While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching."

Computational methods provide the necessary insights and guidance for future research. However, existing simulations typically focus on only isolated aspects of solar cells. This lack of consistency highlights the need for a framework unifying all computational levels, from material to cell properties, for accurate prediction and optimization of EY prediction. To address this challenge, a differentiable digital twin, Sol(Di)$^2$T, is introduced to enable comprehensive end-to-end optimization of solar cells. The workflow starts with material properties and morphological processing parameters, followed by optical and electrical simulations. Finally, climatic conditions and geographic location are incorporated to predict the EY. Each step is either intrinsically differentiable or replaced with a machine-learned surrogate model, enabling not only accurate EY prediction but also gradient-based optimization with respect to input parameters. Consequently, Sol(Di)$^2$T extends EY predictions to previously unexplored conditions. Demonstrated for an organic solar cell, the proposed framework marks a significant step towards tailoring solar cells for specific applications while ensuring maximal performance."

    "abstract": "The Kepler problem in classical mechanics exhibits a rich structure of conserved quantities, highlighted by the Laplace--Runge--Lenz (LRL) vector. Through Noether's theorem in reverse, the LRL vector gives rise to a corresponding infinitesimal dynamical symmetry on the kinematical variables, which is well known in the literature. However, the physically relevant part of the LRL vector is its direction angle in the plane of motion (since its magnitude is just a function of energy and angular momentum). The present work derives the infinitesimal dynamical symmetry corresponding to the direction part of the LRL vector, and obtains the explicit form of the symmetry transformations that it generates. When combined with the rotation symmetries,the resulting symmetry group is shown to be the semi-direct product of $SO(3)$ and $R^3$. This stands in contrast to the $SO(4)$ symmetry group generated by the LRL symmetries and the rotations. As a by-product, the action of the new infinitesimal symmetries on all of the conserved quanties is obtained. The results are given in terms of the physical kinematical variables in the Kepler problem, rather than in an enlarged auxiliary space in which the LRL symmetries are usually stated."

    "abstract": "We broach a seldom-discussed topic in precision metrology; how subtle errors in calibration processes are discovered and remedied. We examine a case study at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK, involving the calibration of DC standard resistors of value 100 MOhm and 1 GOhm. Results from the period 2001 to 2015 were in error by approximately 0.7 parts per million (ppm), with quoted uncertainties (k=2) of 0.4 ppm and 1.6 ppm respectively. Inter-comparisons did not detect the error, mainly because the uncertainty due to the transportation drift of the comparison standards was too large to resolve it. Likewise, research into single-electron current standards did not detect the error because at this resistance value it was on the borderline of statistical significance. The key event was a comparison between PTB (Germany) and NPL (UK) of a new small-current measuring instrument, the ultrastable low-noise current amplifier (ULCA). At that time, the transport stability of the ULCA was not well established. Nevertheless, calibrations of the ULCA at NPL using a 100 MOhm resistor were sufficiently discrepant with the PTB calibrations to motivate a thorough investigation into the NPL traceability chain, which uncovered the error. This instructive episode illustrates a positive interplay between calibration and research activities and shows that cutting-edge calibration uncertainties must be supported by a vigorous research programme. It is also important for NMIs to maintain a comfortable buffer (at least a factor of 10) between their claimed uncertainty and the uncertainty that their customers require, so that small errors can be resolved without significant impact on measurement stakeholders."

    "abstract": "Many modern datasets consist of multiple related matrices measured on a common set of units, where the goal is to recover the shared low-dimensional subspace. While the Angle-based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) framework provides a solution, it relies on equal-weight aggregation, which can be strictly suboptimal when views exhibit significant statistical heterogeneity (arising from varying SNR and dimensions) and structural heterogeneity (arising from individual components). In this paper, we propose HeteroJIVE, a weighted two-stage spectral algorithm tailored to such heterogeneity. Theoretically, we first revisit the ``non-diminishing\" error barrier with respect to the number of views $K$ identified in recent literature for the equal-weight case. We demonstrate that this barrier is not universal: under generic geometric conditions, the bias term vanishes and our estimator achieves the $O(K^{-1/2})$ rate without the need for iterative refinement. Extending this to the general-weight case, we establish error bounds that explicitly disentangle the two layers of heterogeneity. Based on this, we derive an oracle-optimal weighting scheme implemented via a data-driven procedure. Extensive simulations corroborate our theoretical findings, and an application to TCGA-BRCA multi-omics data validates the superiority of HeteroJIVE in practice."

By combining molecular dynamics simulations, mass photometry and Cryo-EM, we also discover that NANOG forms self-limiting micelle-like clusters which expose their DNA-binding domains. In dense solutions of DNA, NANOG micelle-like structures stabilize intermolecular entanglements and crosslinks, forming microgel-like structures. Our findings suggest that NANOG may contribute to regulate gene expression in a unconventional way: by restricting and stabilizing genome dynamics at key transcriptional sites through the formation of an aging microgel-like structure, potentially enabling mechanical memory in the gene network."

To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100\\% navigation success and 0.09 s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation."

It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice."

While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101."

We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior."

Subsequently, a hypothesis test of two uncertain populations is proposed, and the rejection region for the null hypothesis at a significance level is derived, laying the foundation for further analysis. Building on this, a homogeneity test for multiple populations is developed to assess whether the unknown population parameters differ significantly. When there is no significant difference in these parameters among finite populations or within a subset, a common test is used to determine whether they equal a fixed constant. Finally, homogeneity and common tests for normal uncertain populations with means and standard deviations are conducted under three cases: only means, only standard deviations, or both are unknown.

Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices.

Based on responses from 44 public authorities across healthcare, government, and higher education sectors, this study reveals significant gaps between technological possibilities and organizational realities. Findings show highly limited AI adoption (only one authority reported using AI tools), widespread absence of formal redaction policies (50 percent reported \"information not held\"), and deficiencies in staff training. The study identifies three key barriers to effective AI implementation: poor record-keeping practices, lack of standardized redaction guidelines, and insufficient specialized training for human oversight. These findings highlight the need for a socio-technical approach that balances technological automation with meaningful human expertise.

Following this motivation, we derive the loss function of the diffusion model augmented with physics-based constraint terms and further design the training and generation framework for the proposed physics-inspired CKM generation diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms all existing methods in terms of construction accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model provides a unified and effective framework with strong potential for generating diverse, accurate, and physically consistent CKM."

While PT-symmetry breaking has been studied in various physical systems, its observation on a quantum many-body level remains elusive. Here, we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian XY model in a strongly-interacting Rydberg-atom array. By measuring the Loschmidt Echo of a fully polarized state, we observe distinct dynamical signatures of a PT-symmetry-breaking phase transition. Dipole interactions are found to play a crucial role, not only determining the transition point but also triggering a non-Hermitian many-body blockade effect that protects the Loschmidt Echo from decay with a non-monotonic dependence on the system size. Our results reveal intricate interaction-induced effects on PT-symmetry breaking and open the door for exploring non-Hermitian many-body dynamics beyond single-particle and mean-field paradigms."

Asymmetric interface coupling breaks inversion symmetry and induces a spontaneous Pi/2 phase difference, thereby breaking time-reversal symmetry without a magnetic field. In this TRS-broken state, the SDE emerges when single-Cooper-pair tunneling is enabled at the s-d interfaces, with its polarity and efficiency controllable by rotating the d-wave crystallographic orientation or perturbing its intrinsic C4 symmetry.

    "abstract": "Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU."

    "abstract": "Understanding and classifying multipartite entanglement is fundamental to quantum information processing. A useful measure of multipartite entanglement is the minimal decomposition entropy, defined as the minimum of the Rényi entropy $ S_q $ associated with the state's decomposition over all local product bases. This quantity identifies the product bases in which the state is maximally localized, thereby yielding optimal representations for analyzing local-unitary equivalence and structural properties of multipartite states. We investigate the minimal decomposition entropy for absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states, a class of highly entangled states characterized by their maximal entanglement across any bipartitions. We present a numerical algorithm for computing the minimal decomposition entropy for finite $ q>1 $. Entropy distributions for AME and Haar random states are obtained for $ q=2 $ and $ q=\\infty $ in qubit, qutrit, and ququad systems. For $ q=2 $, AME states of four qutrits and four ququads exhibit smaller minimal decomposition entropy than Haar random states, indicating more localized optimal representations. For $ q=\\infty $, corresponding to the geometric measure of entanglement, AME states display higher entanglement than Haar random states. The algorithm additionally produces simpler and sparser decompositions of known AME states, aiding in distinguishing genuinely quantum AME states from those associated with classical combinatorial designs."

For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \\emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes. Our contribution is not optimality but \\emph{implementational simplicity} and an \\emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior."

While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process."

However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist.

Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing."

Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries."

Using class AII in three dimensions as an example, which is relevant to realistic topological insulators like Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, this method reveals the criteria for the invariance of topological order in the presence of disorder, as well as the possibility of a smooth cross over between two topological phases caused by disorder. In addition, the significantly enlarged system size in the numerical calculation implies that this method is capable of capturing the quantum criticality much closer to topological phase transitions, as demonstrated by a nonlocal topological marker."

The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation."

    "abstract": "In this work we study the possibility of modeling the dark matter content in galaxies as a core-halo model consisting of self-gravitating, self-interacting fermions. For the core of the halo, the dark matter fermions are degenerate, while for the halo we have considered two possibilities: the fermions have thermalized as a perfect fluidor they will follow a standard cold dark matter Navarro-Frenk-White profile. The core density profile is obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and their properties are determined by the fermion mass, the central density and the interaction strength. The mass of the fermion and the strength of the fermion self-interaction is fixed by doing a $χ^2$ analysis to fit that fit the rotational curves of Low Surface Brightness galaxies. It was found that the fermion mass should be in the range $38.73~\\rm{eV}< m_{f} < 42.11~\\rm{eV}$ and the interparticle strength in the range $269.69 < y <348.48$ at $68$ C.L. in order to reproduce the rotational curves adequately, in the case when the halo is modeled as a thermalized ideal gas. Similar values are obtained if the halo is modeled following a Navarro-Frenk-White case, namely $41.54 ~\\rm{eV} < m_{f} <49.87 ~\\rm{eV}$ and $5606.06< y < 17484.84$. Once fixed the values of the mass of the fermion $m_f$ and the interaction strength $y$, we tested the core-halo model with data from the Milky Way and the SPARC database. We have found good agreement between the data and the core-halo models, varying only one free parameter: the central density. Thus a single fermion can fit hundreds of galaxies. Nevertheless, the dark matter halo surface density relation or the halo total mass and radius depend strongly on the model for the halo."

To this end, we introduce a localized version of Gromov's distortion for any closed path-connected subset of $\\R^n$. If two such sets have local Gromov distortion below a universal dimension-dependent constant $g_n$ at some scale, and if their Hausdorff-distance is less than one quarter of that scale, we can show that the fundamental groups of their complements are isomorphic. In addition, we construct this isomorphism so that it restricts to the corresponding peripheral subgroups as an isomorphism as well. Applied to the images of one-dimensional knots it follows that two knots are equivalent if their Hausdorff-distance is bounded in terms of the scale under which their local Gromov distortion is controlled. From that we deduce novel stability results for knot equivalence in the Lipschitz category, and in the setting of fractional Sobolev regularity below $C^1$. Moreover, we prove a compactness theorem of knot equivalence classes with respect to weak $W^{3/2,2}$-convergence. As an application we show that the Möbius energy introduced by O'Hara~\\cite{ohara_1991a} can be minimized within arbitrary prime knot classes under a symmetry constraint, and that these minimizers are in fact critical points and therefore smooth and even real analytic. In particular, in every torus knot class there are at least two distinct critical knots for the Möbius energy."

Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction."

Here we introduce a unified optical framework that removes this constraint, using only Gaussian inputs, optical parametric amplification, and heralded photon detection. Within a single architecture, we demonstrate the generation of photon-added squeezed states with near unit fidelity, cubic-phase-like states with strong non-linearities and fidelities above 98.5%, and squeezed-cat states exceeding 99% fidelity that can be iteratively bred into GKP grid states surpassing the 9.75 dB fault-tolerance threshold.

Based on this mechanism, we obtain our main result a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi Brillouin zone. Reduced to periodic systems, our result gives an explicit and compact formula which enables us to directly calculate Chern numbers by microscopic data.

In this work, we derive an analytical approximation formula for ${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$ for flat, $Λ$CDM and $w$CDM universes. We show that our approximation works well for the ranges $0.01 \\leq z \\leq 2$, $0.2 \\leq Ω_m \\leq 1.0$ and $-3.0 \\leq w \\leq -0.5$, with relative fractional error to a numerically evaluated ${\\rm DM}_{\\rm diff}$ always smaller than $3.5\\ \\%$, in the worst case scenario, and in most cases smaller than $0.5\\ \\%$. Moreover, the approximation is more than $15$ ($2$) times faster than the numerical solution of $Λ$CDM ($w$CDM). Therefore, we hope that it could be a useful tool for the FRB community."

    "abstract": "We investigate the challenges of constructing neutron star (NS) solutions in $f(\\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, highlighting the importance of treating the affine connection as an active, dynamical component of the theory. We begin by clarifying under what conditions standard simplifications -- such as the coincident gauge or General Relativity (GR)-like connections -- inadvertently lead to GR behavior, even in non-trivial $f(\\mathbb{Q})$ models. Building on previous work in black hole (BH) spacetimes, we adapt the formalism to NS and extend it to non-vacuum configurations. Focusing on two representative models, $f(\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q} + α\\mathbb{Q}^2$ and $f(\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}^β$, our analysis suggests that, under standard regularity assumptions, solutions with Maclaurin/Laurent-type series recover GR dynamics, pointing to more intricate structures as the likely seat of beyond-GR effects, and reflecting the constraints imposed by the connection's dynamics on the asymptotic behavior of genuinely beyond-GR solutions. We then formulate the problem as a boundary value problem (BVP) and highlight the numerical pathologies that may arise, together with possible strategies to prevent them. This work aims to provide a concrete framework for future numerical studies and outlines the theoretical consistency conditions required to construct physically meaningful beyond-GR NS solutions in $f(\\mathbb{Q})$ gravity."

Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the growing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under-represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official baselines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vector Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. We also utilized transformer-based models such as DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods for the subtasks, except for DistilBERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language-specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre-trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language."

In this paper, we present a Datalake infrastructure tailored to the needs of interdisciplinary social science research. Our system supports ingestion and integration of diverse data types, automatic provenance and version tracking, role-based access control, and built-in tools for visualization and analysis. We demonstrate the utility of our Datalake using real-world use cases spanning governance, health, and education. A detailed walkthrough of one such use case -- analyzing the relationship between income, education, and infant mortality -- shows how our platform streamlines the research process while maintaining transparency and reproducibility. We argue that such infrastructure can democratize access to advanced data science practices, especially for NGOs, students, and grassroots organizations. The Datalake continues to evolve with plans to support ML pipelines, mobile access, and citizen data feedback mechanisms."

Here, we demonstrate improved spectroscopy of confined excitations using two distinct error-resilient circuit construction techniques on the IBM Torino device: first-order Trotter decomposition utilizing native fractional gates, and a tensor-network-based circuit compression via Riemannian optimization. By analyzing the Fourier spectrum of error-mitigated time-series data, we successfully identify key signatures of $E_8$ symmetry despite hardware noise. These results validate the viability of both circuit compression and hardware-efficient compilation for probing complex topological phenomena on NISQ devices."

    "abstract": "In a periodic lattice system an entangled antipodal pair state, otherwise known as a crosscap state, is a simple two site product state in which spins at antipodal sites are prepared in Bell pairs. Such states have maximal bipartite entanglement and serve as a useful platform for studying the quench dynamics of systems which have large initial entanglement. In this paper, we study a generalization of these states which we dub entangled mutipodal states. These states, which are defined for fermionic systems, generalize the crosscap states by having correlations among more than two sites, specifically, those which sit at the vertices of regular polygons. By construction, the states are Gaussian and translationally invariant allowing many of their properties to be understood. We study the bipartite entanglement entropy of these states both in and out of equilibrium. In equilibrium, the entanglement profile as a function of subsystem size exhibits two distinct regimes, a volume-law growth followed by a saturation to a constant value, thus generalizing the Page-curve profile of the crosscap state. In the non-equilibrium setting, we study quenches from these initial states to the free-fermion chain, whose ensuing dynamics displays a far richer structure compared to the crosscap case. We interpret our results in terms of the quasiparticle picture, which requires multiplets of quasiparticles to be excited non-locally around the system. This scenario is confirmed by the appearance of a post-quench, negative tripartite information."

We present an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)-powered framework for resilient and efficient operation of multi-band satellite networks. It is based on distributed mechanisms for atmospheric sensing, cell-to-satellite matching, and resource allocation (RA) in a 5G Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) wide-area scenario with quasi-Earth fixed cells and a beam hopping mechanism. Results with a multi-layer multi-band constellation with satellites operating in the S- and K-bands demonstrate the benefits of our framework for ISAC-powered multi-band systems, which achieves 73% higher throughput per user when compared to single S- and K-band systems."

    "abstract": "LiDAR-captured point clouds are often considered the gold standard in active 3D reconstruction. While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods."

We show that if a vertex satisfies a certain degree condition, then some Hilbert coefficients remain unchanged upon its removal, thereby providing a reduction technique for computing Hilbert coefficients. As an application, for any $i\\geq 0$ and a pair $(r,s)$ with $r\\geq 2, s\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we show that there always exists a graph $G$ such that $\\mathrm{reg}(S/J_G)=r$ and $e_i(S/J_G)=s$, where $\\mathrm{reg}(S/J_G)$ and $e_i(R/J_G)$ denote the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the $i$-th Hilbert coefficient of $S/J_G$, respectively.

    "abstract": "Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model."

Therefore, we design a modeling method of distributed economic dispatch system (DEDS) based on consensus protocol from the perspective of cyber-physical coupling. Firstly, the architecture and control strategy of the DEDS are introduced. Then, the distributed generation control models are established, which are combined with the DN model and linearized to derive the state-space model of the DEDS. Subsequently, the small-signal stability analysis of the DEDS is performed by means of the eigenvalue analysis method. Finally, the validity of the DEDS and the correctness of the stability analysis are demonstrated by a simulation model in IEEE-33 bus DN."

Although UAV-assisted MEC can achieve strong efficiency and flexibility enhancements for mobile users, it results in serious resource allocation and task scheduling problems. The computing, storage, and communication resources of UAVs should be efficiently allocated and scheduled so that the service quality at different positions is ensured even in a highly dynamic environment. In this work, we focus on the UAV-assisted MEC problem and design a pointer network-based reinforcement learning framework that effectively addresses the pain point of poor reusability of traditional reinforcement learning methods and optimizes the decision-making behavior of UAVs to improve the system performance. First, with the models of UAVs and mobile users, we analyze the collision avoidance, motion continuity, coverage, and energy consumption constraints of UAVs, and formulate the UAV-assisted MEC problem as a multi-constraint combinatorial optimization one. Then, inspired by the suitability of pointer networks in effectively handling variable-length sequences, we propose a pointer network-based reinforcement learning framework to seek an optimal service strategy for every UAV while minimizing the completion time of MEC tasks. Simulation experiments are conducted on randomly generated environments to quantitatively analyze the performance of our approach, and the experimental results indicate that compared to traditional methods, our approach can reduce the task completion time, flight path length, and energy consumption by more than 1.25%, 2.78%, and 1.12%, respectively."

Although deep learning (DL) methods, particularly those employing large language models (LLMs), have shown strong performance in automating vulnerability identification, they remain susceptible to adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted inputs with subtle perturbations designed to evade detection. Existing adversarial attack methods often require access to model architectures or confidence scores, making them impractical for real-world black-box systems. In this paper, we propose SVulAttack, a novel label-only adversarial attack framework targeting LLM-based vulnerability detectors. Our key innovation lies in a similarity-based strategy that estimates statement importance and model confidence, thereby enabling more effective selection of semantic-preserving code perturbations. SVulAttack combines this strategy with a transformation component and a search component, based on either greedy or genetic algorithms, to effectively identify and apply optimal combinations of transformations. We evaluate SVulAttack on open-source models (LineVul, StagedVulBERT, Code Llama, Deepseek-Coder) and closed-source models (GPT-5 nano, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet 4). Results show that SVulAttack significantly outperforms existing label-only black-box attack methods. For example, against LineVul, our method with genetic algorithm achieves an attack success rate of 49.0%, improving over DIP and CODA by 150.0% and 240.3%, respectively."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) enables efficient machine learning by connecting terminal devices to coordinate distributed model training. In typical scenarios, each device is treated as a computing node, training local models with its local data and updating the global model by exchanging parameters with neighbors. However, as the dataset scales grow, communication costs limit the scalability of distributed machine-learning algorithms. Moreover, parameters sharing increases the risk of privacy leakage. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a distributed alternating direction method of multipliers based on load balancing sparse allreduce (LBSA-ADMM). Unlike traditional distributed ADMM algorithms, LBSA-ADMM requires each node to compute and communicate only its associated features, drastically reducing overhead. More importantly, LBSA is tailored for performing allreduce on transmission parameters of all nodes. LBSA divides transmission parameters according to the weight of each feature, effectively balancing communication overhead across nodes. Furthermore, the paper proposes a differential privacy ADMM (DP-LBSA-ADMM) to enhance the security of LBSA-ADMM by injecting noise into penalty parameters. This algorithm dynamically adjusts penalty parameters to balance accuracy and privacy, with convergence guaranteed theoretically and empirically. Experimental results demonstrate that LBSA significantly reduces communication costs compared to state-of-the-art methods, DP-LBSA-ADMM achieves faster convergence than comparable ADMM algorithms."

While database systems have extensively adopted SIMD for traditional operations, its potential for complex event pattern matching remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a novel approach that bridges this gap through bit-parallel processing enhanced with AVX-512 vectorization. Our approach encodes event streams into compact bit sequences, where each bit corresponds to a time slice, and an event's presence is marked by a 1-bit when its timestamp falls within the respective slice. This representation enables the formulation of bit-parallel operations that natively enforce complex event constraints, including temporal window requirements and event ordering relationships. We develop a family of bit-parallel algorithms that leverage this representation for continuous event matching, and further optimize their performance through SIMD vectorization (AVX-512 instructions) to exploit modern hardware parallelism. Experimental evaluations on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving at least 35.7x improvement in query efficiency compared to state-of-the-art alternatives."

    "abstract": "Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a direct proxy for photosynthetic activity, yet existing satellite SIF products are constrained by coarse spatial resolution, limiting their application in ecological and agricultural studies. In this work, we propose a One-Step Learned Spatial Redistribution Convolutional Neural Network (OSRNet) that downscales 0.05° TROPOMI SIF to 0.005° by learning spatially adaptive redistribution fields from high-resolution drivers, which allocate coarse-resolution satellite SIF into fine-resolution grids. Based on this framework, we generate RSIF, a global 16-day 0.005° SIF dataset for 2018–2020. Comprehensive evaluation against both satellite and tower-based SIF shows that RSIF maintains strong consistency with TROPOMI observations (R² = 0.976, RMSE = 0.036) while recovering fine-scale spatial details. OSRNet substantially outperforms established direct prediction methods such as RF and SIFNet, and, compared with post hoc corrected RF approach from prior studies, achieves the highest R² across all tower sites and generally the lowest RMSE, enabling more accurate representation of seasonal dynamics with improved spatial fidelity."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), App vendors are increasingly motivated to cache multiple data replicas on geographically distributed edge servers to ensure rapid responses for latency-sensitive applications. However, the security of data replicas is a critical concern due to the dynamic nature and resource limitations of MEC environments. To this end, data replicas’ integrity must be regularly verified to maintain the accuracy of data-driven decision-making. Existing Edge Data Integrity (EDI) verification solutions suffer from low efficiency due to relying on indiscriminative verification, where all data replicas are checked at each round without considering their inherent reliability characteristics. This paper designs an Intelligent framework called I-EDI, which enables discriminative EDI verification by integrating a novel Long-term Unreliable data Replica Selection (L-URS) mechanism. This framework aims to reduce verification costs without compromising accuracy, while resisting spoofing, forgery, outsourcing, collusion, alteration-before-verification, delayed-response, and adaptive attacks. Specifically, each data replica is associated with a reliability representation by evaluating its long-term performance. Based on that, the L-URS problem is defined as stochastically minimizing the global reliability representation over time, subject to constraints on the number of data replicas to be verified. To make it easy-to-handle, the L-URS problem is decomposed into a series of online minimization problems. An Online Opportunistic-based Replica Selection approach called O<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>RS is developed. O<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>RS allows App vendors to significantly decrease verification costs by targetedly inspecting unreliable data replicas. Moreover, this work provides a thorough theoretical analysis of O<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>RS’s time complexity and approximation bound, as well as I-EDI’s security.

    "abstract": "Matrix operators are fundamental to various applications, particularly in deep learning. While early models relied on dense operations, techniques like pruning have introduced sparsity, leading to a mix of dense and sparse operator types. Most existing accelerators are specialized for specific operators and perform poorly in mixed scenarios, while those supporting multiple operators often lack flexibility and suffer from suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose VersaAccel, a configurable accelerator for sparse and dense matrix operators. It supports four distinct configurations, each optimized for a set of operators. A key feature of our design is its adaptive configuration selection mechanism, driven by a lightweight cost model that explicitly evaluates the performance-energy trade-off between available options. This allows VersaAccel to dynamically choose the most efficient configuration—opting for higher performance when the gain outweighs the energy cost, or prioritizing energy efficiency when appropriate. Experimental results demonstrate that VersaAccel achieves an average performance/area improvement of 3.10× across multiple operators (MV, MM, SPMV, SpMM, SpMSpM) and 4.06× on full model evaluations (ResNet18, VGG16, LLaMA2-7B, BERT-Base), compared to mainstream accelerators."

    "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved significant success in automating neural network design, particularly through evolutionary NAS. To address the critical need for efficient architecture discovery across diverse scenarios, such as computer vision and natural language processing, multitask NAS (MT-NAS) methods have emerged. Nevertheless, existing MT-NAS approaches still face critical challenges, including redundant search arising from insufficient exploitation of population historical information across generations and negative transfer caused by unguided interactions between tasks. To address these limitations, a population historical information-driven evolutionary multitask neural architecture search (HIMT-NAS) algorithm is proposed. For each generation, the population historical information is recorded, which includes the operation information and the topology information. In the search process, systematic utilization of population historical information to guide evolutionary search directions, preventing redundant search. Furthermore, the proposed method adjusts cross-task knowledge transfer probability by measuring task similarity through patterns in population historical information, and then updates transfer probabilities when the information proves useful across multiple tasks. Extensive experiments on MedMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate consistent advantages of the proposed method over both single-task NAS methods and recent MT-NAS methods."

    "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) datasets are plagued by fuzzy label uncertainty due to interclass similarities, compound emotions, and annotation subjectivity. Moreover, the complexity of recognition differs across various expression categories, making an undifferentiated method inequitable for each expression. In this work, we propose adaptive sample mining (ASM), a fuzzy membership-driven framework with two innovations: it constructs a category-specific dynamic threshold set as the average probabilities of samples that are correctly predicted, through which it explicitly separates clean and noisy subsets while leaving ambiguous samples as the intermediate fuzzy region between them. In addition, it introduces a rule based on multilocal region prediction consistency to reclassify samples from the clean subset into the ambiguous subset when local predictions conflict. Finally, the triregularization module implements tailored training approaches for these three subsets: the clean subset is trained using a supervised learning strategy to maximize the utility of high-quality annotations, the ambiguous subset adopts a mutual learning strategy to enhance discrimination capability, and the noisy subset employs an unsupervised learning technique so that it can minimize the influence from noisy labels. We performed comprehensive experiments on the RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet. The proposed ASM achieved 90.94% accuracy on RAF-DB and 86.81% on its synthetic noisy version. The ablation experiment and analysis demonstrate that our method can efficiently identify ambiguous and noisy labels. By weighting the classification loss based on fuzzy membership, it helps to make efficient use of the labels. This results in an improvement in accuracy."

Protection is a critical challenge in DC microgrid operation, as the absence of zero crossings renders traditional protection schemes ineffective. Additionally, the protection design is further complicated in a DC microgrid with a ring configuration and bidirectional power flow. Recent studies on DC microgrid protection are mostly focused on fault detection methodology but identifying the accurate location of fault in the line is also needed for the system restoration and maintenance. In this work a fault location algorithm is proposed based on the line parameter approach. By using the current characteristics during the fault, the frequency is computed. Based on the correlation between inductance of the line and frequency, the fault location is determined. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified in MATLAB/Simulink simulation flat form for various fault conditions."

We propose a novel predefined threshold computation method minimizing spatial detection errors, rigorously validated through the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) criterion. Furthermore, we derive an analytical Average Bit Error Probability (ABEP) expression tailored for energy detection, exploiting inherent constellation energy distributions. The analytical derivation was validated via link-level simulations under two scenarios: (i) perfect spatial detection, and (ii) practical spatial detection. The results show spatial errors dominating overall performance, shifted from theoretical values by practical spatial detection using multiple thresholds for different energy levels in 16QAM. Crucially, an inverted error trend revealed between GRSM-4QAM and GRSM-16QAM, highlighting a tradeoff between error resilience, complexity, and energy efficiency."

    "abstract": "The precise classification of the detected lesions can help doctors further determine the type of lesions and implement treatment plans, which is of great importance for the later treatment of the disease. Due to the diverse morphology and complex structure of pulmonary tuberculosis lesions, the classification accuracy of the general network is low in the classification process. Aimed to these problems, a method is proposed to classify and detect pulmonary tuberculosis lesions guided by a normalized attention mechanism. The NA-YOLO precise classification network for lesions was constructed. Firstly, in terms of data augmentation, a multi-scale image label synchronous data augmentation scheme is proposed to balance the number of various lesions. In terms of network construction, the attention modules of the channel and space branches guide the network to focus on the lesion feature areas, further enhancing the extraction of inter-channel and local spatial information. Secondly, the loss function is optimized through Scylla-IoU Loss Function(SIoU) to reduce the total degree of freedom between images. Ultimately, achieving a precise classification of four common types of pulmonary tuberculosis lesions. The high-precision classification performance of the proposed method was further verified through ablation and comparative experiments."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithm in online recommendation systems, specifically comparing the performance of UCB1, LinUCB, V-LinUCB, and NeuralUCB across static environments. It also introduces the concepts of conceptual drift and exponential decay in dynamic, non-steady scenarios. The paper presents extended experiments using DecayLinUCB and DecayVLinUCB. First, using the MovieLens dataset, the cumulative regret values and CTR@1 of each algorithm under a fixed distribution are simulated offline, demonstrating that NeuralUCB has advantages in long-term recommendation quality, while UCB1 is lighter for real-time use and resource consumption. Furthermore, V-LinUCB shows convergence advantages in the later stages. Secondly, a protocol for data drift and historical parameter decay is designed to occur every 20,000 rounds. This method evaluates the algorithm's adaptability and its recovery effect during sudden changes in user preferences. During the scenarios involving conceptual drift, NeuralUCB and DecayVLinUCB achieve the lowest regret and the highest CTR recovery level, respectively. Additionally, DecayLinUCB demonstrates rapid convergence after a drift, achieving zero new regrets. The findings offer practical insights into applying MAB algorithms under dynamic conditions and suggest directions for future work on adaptive decay strategies."

    "abstract": "Thermal infrared object detection has been widely used in autonomous driving and safety monitoring, and modern deep learning techniques together with the availability of massive labeled data largely promote its advancements. However, recent deep learning approaches for thermal infrared object detection are vulnerable to well-designed sample attacks and have potential safety risks. Existing adversarial attack methods of introducing pixel-level perturbation in the white-box manners are mainly designed for visible light scenes and challenging to apply in infrared scenes for two reasons. Firstly, it is difficult to model the attacks in the physical world that originate from the sensor level. Secondly, the introduced patterns may be inadequate for adversarial training because infrared sensors with limited resolution could not resolve intricate and fine-grained patterns. To this end, this study firstly examines the existing challenges from the perspective of fractal theory, and then proposes an innovative adversarial attack strategy based on fractal geometry-inspired self-similarity pattern loss function. The proposed loss function is based on a universal observation that the resolution of the adversarial pattern received by the sensors decreases with the increase of attack range, which can be well modeled by fractal-geometry-based self-similarity measurement. Empirical evidence indicates that patches trained with fractal loss exhibit an effective attack distance approximately doubled compared with the original one."

    "abstract": "In the current scenario of the vehicle industry, there is a growing demand for electric vehicles. Electric vehicles work on batteries that require a battery management system for better battery life. The performance of the battery decreases as the number of charging-discharging cycles increases. For a battery management system, it is essential to estimate the state of charge of a battery. To enhance the performance of the battery, proper estimation of the state of charge is necessary. There are various methods for state of charge estimation like the coulomb counting method, open-circuit voltage method, and Kalman filters. In this paper, we propose a unified dual extended Kalman filtering framework for estimation of battery parameters and state of charge of a lithium-ion battery. Additionally, a comparison has been shown between the above framework and other commonly used estimation methods in industries like extended Kalman filter with recursive least squares, and enhanced coulomb counting method. The results show that the dual extended Kalman filtering method is by far the best option for state of charge estimation as compared with the other methods discussed in this paper."

    "abstract": "Language identification is critical in facilitating effective communication, particularly in multilingual regions like India, where many languages and dialects exist. However, the challenge becomes more pronounced when dealing with region-specific low-resource languages, which are underrepresented in global datasets and often overlooked in research. This study addresses the gap in language identification for such low-resource languages, with a specific focus on Indian languages. While existing literature highlights the importance of language identification, little work has been done for low-resource languages, especially in the Indian context. To tackle this issue, we propose a deep learning-based solution using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model to identify low-resource languages from audio datasets. We focus on four languages—Sindhi, Assamese, Manipuri, and Malayalam—and use Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features extracted from audio samples collected from sources like Kaggle and AI4 Bharat. The CRNN model is trained on these features to accurately identify the language, overcoming the limitations of the scarcity of labeled data. The results demonstrate the model's potential in addressing language identification challenges for low-resource languages, ultimately contributing to better communication in linguistically diverse regions."

NCVFS supports large video file storage using efficient coding techniques while preserving existing storage logic. It introduces a centralized metadata system to avoid bottlenecks and features a lightweight recovery mechanism to reduce downtime during node failures. By decoupling metadata management from the data path and supporting flexible coding schemes, NCVFS improves availability, scalability, and storage efficiency. Experimental results show that NCVFS significantly outperforms replication-based systems in terms of resource utilization and reliability, offering a viable solution for modern cloud storage needs."

These hallucinations pose hazards in crucial applications, including the legal, medical, and educational fields, by compromising the quality and dependability of AIgenerated content. Resolving this issue is essential for enhancing the reliability and practical applications of LLMs. Through a thorough approach that incorporates quantitative measures and visualization techniques, this study seeks to assess hallucinations in LLMs. The overall objective is to establish robust methods for identifying, quantifying, and comparing hallucination patterns across different models and applications. Through the scrutiny of the performance of different large language models (LLMs), the research seeks to determine patterns and causative factors of hallucinations.

    "abstract": "In recent years, UAVs have been used for disaster relief operations, search and rescue operations, military patrols, ecological surveys, and many other applications. One of the most exciting developments in this area is the emergence of Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs). FANETs resemble Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) and Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETS), where the drones can form a communication network with no pre-established fixed infrastructure. Creating their communication network can be very useful in civilian and defence contexts where real-time exchange of timely information between the UAVs can be a life-or-death determination. However, those simple acts of flying drones around are not enough to create useful communication networks between them. The same two characteristics of FANETs that make them attractive, the mobility and continually changing topology of drones, make the development of routing protocols that are reliable but timely problematic. Given that the routing protocol will control the performance of the whole network, developing routing protocols that adequately balance cost, reliability, and timely delivery in the dynamic UAV environment remains a challenging problem. In this study, the effectiveness of several UAV routing protocols is examined, including Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). These protocols’ performance is evaluated using a variety of measures, including Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Throughput, and End-to-End Delay. The findings estimate the effectiveness of routing processes. This research carefully explores how different routing protocols function under the given application of disaster management scenarios and search and rescue missions."

However, its lack of molecular specificity often necessitates complementary immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect protein-level biomarkers critical for diagnosis and treatment planning. In scenarios where IHC is impractical, due to cost, limited tissue, or logistical constraints, computational alternatives may provide viable solutions. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of predicting CAF-1/p60 protein expression directly from H&E-stained slides using deep learning. Leveraging a curated dataset of oral squamous cell carcinoma samples with nucleus-level annotations, we classify nuclei into three categories: (i) Tumor-CAF-1/p60-positive, (ii) Tumor-CAF1/p 6 0-negative, and (iii) stromal. Our results demonstrate that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn morphological cues indicative of protein expression, achieving promising classification performance at the single-cell level. This approach may enable more accessible molecular profiling from routine H&E slides, reducing dependency on specialized staining procedures in resource-constrained or time-sensitive settings."

Model-Based Design (MBD) has emerged as a methodology, where models with their formal/semi-formal basis are not only used to specify and eventually automate the implementation of the systems but also provide means to produce evidence regarding their dependability. MBD fosters the tight coupling between system design and simulation. Simulation, the execution of the models, enables virtual verification and validation (V&V). Thereby the feedback cycles are shortened and faster design iterations are enabled.

    "abstract": "Hard Disk drive failures in data centers introduce significant challenges, including data loss, downtime, service outages and increased operational costs. Traditional ML (Machine learning) and DL (Deep Learning) models struggle to deliver satisfactory prediction due to poor generalization and high data imbalance issue. This study introduces novel hybrid model that combines Sequential Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with Multi-head Attention (MHA) and an optimized XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) with an adaptive learning-rate scheduler. The model undergoes extensive data preprocessing using different polynomial feature interactions which capture non-linear relations among SMART data to achieve high degree correlation and failure pattern over the time. Additionally, we apply the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling technique (SMOTE) along with a class weighted loss function to tackle class imbalance. The two-stage approach is based on the strengths of both models: BiLSTM’s ability to learn sequential patterns and XGBoost’s capability to handle non-linear relationships. Further model training is enhanced by dynamically adjusting learning rate using adaptive learning rate scheduler to improve model’s accuracy and efficiency. Proposed model is tested using pivotal metrics including Accuracy, False Alarm Rate (FAR), Failure detection rate (FDR), F1-score and precision-recall. Experimental results show enhanced performance with accuracy, precision and F1-score in the range of $\\sim 99 \\%$, FDR/recall up to $97.86 \\%$ and FAR reduced to $\\sim 0.248 \\%$ with bootstrap confidence interval of [0.9917, 0.9962]."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a single-stage power conversion in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, focusing on its ability to perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and efficient charging of batteries. The proposed single-stage converter reduces the number of components by eliminating the need for multiple converters and improves system efficiency by streamlining the power conversion process during battery charging. For efficient MPPT, the design integrates a proportional-integral (PI) controller with a boost converter topology. This also optimizes the battery charging process. The system’s ability to reduce voltage fluctuations and maintain a steady-state voltage is demonstrated. The feasibility of this strategy with a PV system is demonstrated by simulation results that show enhanced energy harvesting from solar cells. Rapid climatic fluctuations are considered to analyze the steady-state, dynamic, and initial conditions of the suggested framework, which is simulated and displayed in MATLAB (R2018a). The system is thoroughly analysed through real-time experimental validation."

Recent improvements in the deep neural networks and their capability have shown significant potential in improving early detection by leveraging medical imaging analysis. We propose a novel soft-attention mechanism-enhanced EfficientNetB0 model for robust ovarian cancer detection. Furthermore, we present a robust analysis of best performing models, including EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB1, VGG-16, VGG-19, and ResNet-50, applied to ovarian cancer diagnosis. By Utilizing publicly available datasets, we evaluate performance of these models', highlighting metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Notably, this novel model demonstrates superior performance, outperforming EfficientNetB0, VGG-16, VGG-19, and ResNet-50 by an average margin of 7.45% in accuracy, 8.23% in F1-score, and 6.18% in precision. This enhancement is ascribed to the integration of attention processes with EfficientNetB0’s compound scaling and optimised architecture, facilitating greater feature extraction and model efficiency. This paper identifies shortcomings in current approaches and suggests future research areas, serving as a crucial resource for enhancing deep learning-based ovarian cancer diagnosis."

The proposed qTVCC leverages the distinctive pre-fault and post-fault behavior of the q-component of bus voltage for enhanced fault detection. To facilitate seamless protection coordination, unified relay settings that remain effective in both grid-connected and islanded modes are derived. The proposed qTVCC is validated on a 12-bus microgrid test system through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform.

Preparation of the Ag-ChG material was carried out using melt-quenching technique, and its morphological properties were analysed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Biological synaptic properties of memristor such as synaptic weight and short-term plasticity were studied together with its memristive characteristics. Namely, the current-voltage characteristics of artificial synaptic memristor based on Ag-ChG material were experimentally determined at several voltage biases using different voltage sweeps. When applying several consecutive voltage sweeps, the obtained results showed that synaptic memristor exhibits a typical short-term depression and short-term potentiation. In addition, the observed increase in the synaptic weight could be attributed to strengthening the connection between two artificial neurons, when it would be realized by using the memristor based on the Ag-ChG material."

To ensure the CWP meets the ATCO's needs and achieves high user acceptance, it is essential to involve them in early design decisions and throughout the development process. This study presents approaches of a more modern CWP design that was developed in a user-centered approach using high fidelity mock-ups with the goal of improving existing CWP designs and integrating advanced features such as weather visualization and trajectory advisories. The design was validated in multiple workshops with ATCOs, focusing on both basic features (e.g., colors, track label design and layout) and more sophisticated functionalities. The quantitative user experience evaluation and qualitative feedback analysis showed very positive results in regards to usability and acceptance, particularly for the integration of conflict advisories and the overall air situation display design. The findings also revealed areas for further enhancement, such as the presentation of weather information and the layout preferences. The validation methodology proved to be an effective and cost-efficient way to evaluate designs with users in early software development stages. The findings of this research provide valuable insights for the development of future CWPs, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting a usercentered design approach. While the low number of participants limits the generalizability of the findings, the study demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of this design approach and the use of high-fidelity mockups in the safety-critical air traffic control domain."

    "abstract": "After the deregulation of electricity market, Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) has emerged as a crucial task for all stakeholders, including generation and retail companies. The inherent complexity and non-linear relationships among the features associated with electricity prices have rendered traditional statistical models to give less efficient forecasting accuracy. This limitation has led to the emergence of deep-learning models, particularly Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, which has the unique ability to handle all the challenges faced by statistical approaches. In this study, we propose a Sliding Window-based BiLSTM (SW-BiLSTM) model, which incorporates a sliding window learning-based mechanism to update the weights of the BiLSTM network. This approach enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies and the nonlinear, stochastic behaviour of electricity prices. Additionally, the hyperparameters of the BiLSTM model are tuned by Bayesian Optimization to improve its accuracy. To mitigate the issue of overfitting, Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) is applied for feature selection, ensuring the retention of the most relevant features while eliminating redundant ones. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through an experimental comparative analysis with state-of-the-art benchmark models. Experimental results demonstrate that the SW-BO-BiLSTM model outperforms existing methods, establishing it as a robust and reliable solution for short-term EPF."

Since all-terrain AGVs have different demand focuses in path planning compared to traditional AGVs, algorithm improvements need to be made based on these focuses. At present, the improvement of the RRT algorithm in most studies lies in shortening the path length and improving the smoothness of the path. There is a certain gap in path simplification. The topic of this study is to improve the RRT algorithm to achieve the goal of planning the path with the least energy consumption. Based on the improvement of the RRT algorithm, the operation process of simplifying the path has been added. It can achieve smoother and shorter path planning with more efficient operations. Under the condition of meeting the short path, almost all redundant nodes are eliminated. The number of nodes in the path is reduced by 90%, the computational load is reduced by 75% (obtained by comparing the number of iterations of redundant nodes), and the distance length is shortened by 43%. It can be applied in path planning for field operations."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental investigation of a 20W passive airflow PEM fuel cell. The effect of variations in hydrogen flow rates: 100 ml/min, 200 ml/min, 300 ml/min, and 400 ml/min on key operational parameters such as temperature, voltage, current, and power output have been investigated. Each of the flow rates was tested for two operation durations: 1.5 hours and 4 hours to compare the behaviour of the fuel cell towards short-term and extended periods of operation. It was found that the hydrogen flow rate is well correlated with output performance metric values. Hydrogen flow was seen to improve the electrical power of the fuel cells with maximum values at the flow rate of 400 ml/min. However, at the same time a noticeable temperature rise was observed in the top-side bipolar plates during the test condition of 400 ml/min of hydrogen flow rate. Interestingly, at a flow rate of 300 ml/min, the fuel cell stabilized the output power faster than at the other flow rates, thus this could be an optimal condition for the hydrogen supply in the setup tested. Further, the study brings out the need to optimize the hydrogen flow rate to obtain a balance between performance and thermal management. The longer test times enabled further investigation of the thermal stability and robustness of the fuel cell under changing flow conditions. In this context, the 4-hour tests focused more on the important aspect of sustaining thermal performance in practical applications. Although the system's performance was evaluated without considering power electronics, in the future, additional studies can incorporate DC-DC converters to have regulated output as well as flexibility of the load. The results highlight that both performance and stability factors need to be taken into consideration during design for practical applications involving PEM fuel cells."

To further enhance device robustness and breakdown characteristics, a Fe-doped buffer layer introduces deep-level acceptor traps, effectively suppressing parasitic conduction and electric field crowding. The proposed structure is evaluated through TCAD simulations for critical parameters including breakdown voltage, drain current density, and transconductance under various bias conditions. The results demonstrate marked improvements in electrical performance, with enhanced breakdown strength, reduced current collapse, and improved channel control.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with attention blocks in order to improve the precision and robustness of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The suggested method makes advantage of the features of both architectures: While attention blocks dynamically recalibrate channel-wise feature responses to underline valuable features and suppress less relevant ones, CNNs are used for effective extraction of spatial dependencies and local patterns from raw sensor data. This mix helps the model to manage noisy input data more efficiently and to learn more significant feature representations for activity classification. Using an end-to-end learning approach, the model jointly maximises spatial and channel-wise characteristics. Because it shows great generalisation across many activities and subjects, this integrated architecture is well-suited for a wide spectrum of realworld HAR applications including fitness tracking, healthcare monitoring, and smart settings. In the WISDM data set, a commonly used benchmark in HAR research, the model obtains an outstanding overall accuracy of $99.61 \\%$ indicating its efficacy and its possible implementation in pragmatic situations."

Static routing protocols, heuristic-based load balancing, and standalone machine learning models (e.g., LSTM or GNN) cannot capture spatial network dependencies and temporal traffic dynamics, making them unable to adapt to real-time traffic fluctuations. LSTM models forecast sequential traffic but lack topological awareness, while GNNs grasp network topology but cannot model time-varying traffic behaviour. We present a Hybrid GNN+LSTM model that synergistically incorporates graph neural networks (GNNs) to overcome these limitations, LSTM networks were used for traffic prediction in time and spatial feature extraction. An attention method dynamically network conditions and traffic need to optimise path selection for Low, High, and Critical traffic classes in our model. Experimental data show that the hybrid technique outperforms standalone LSTM ($95 \\%$ accuracy, 88.7 Mbps), GNN ($92 \\%$ accuracy, 91.2 Mbps), and ViT ($90 \\%$ accuracy, 86.9 Mbps) models with $97 \\%$ accuracy, 95.4 Mbps throughput, and $1.82 \\%$ packet. This reduces flow setup latency to 18.6 ms and ensures $97.1 \\% \\mathrm{QoS}$ adherence, making it effective for real-time congestion mitigation. The results show that spatial and temporal learning in SDN-based IoT networks provides a scalable and intelligent solution for traffic-aware flow optimisation."

    "abstract": "Directional manipulation of liquid droplets is central to the advancement of microfluidics, thermal management, and water harvesting technologies. Here, we elucidate the mechanism underlying directional droplet growth and transport on a bioinspired tri-directional anisotropic slippery surface (TASS) through time-resolved imaging and numerical simulations. Our results reveal that droplets initially expand symmetrically but, upon reaching a critical volume, preferentially spread toward the lower step along the “down” gradient, where geometric asymmetry induces contact and a localized pinning effect. This pinning, coupled with an internal pressure gradient biased toward the “down” direction, drives directional droplet growth. As the droplet propagates, a vapor cavity emerges adjacent to the lower step, generating a transient pressure differential that lifts part of the droplet and facilitates step-to-step transition. We identify two primary factors governing this anisotropic transport: (i) structural asymmetry between adjacent steps that promotes early contact and spreading toward the lower step, and (ii) a persistent internal pressure gradient that reinforces unidirectional motion. The additional role of vapor-induced pressure differentials further enhances droplet elevation and mobility. These insights provide a mechanistic foundation for the design of next-generation anisotropic surfaces with tunable wetting properties, enabling precise control over droplet behavior in diverse technological contexts."

In this paper, an optimization method for distributed energy generation scheduling based on reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed, which combines multi-agent near end strategy optimization (MAPPO) and flexible actor-critic (SAC) algorithm to achieve efficient and collaborative energy management. For centralized microgrid scenarios, SAC algorithm is used to optimize the combined output of photovoltaic, energy storage and traditional units, and its entropy maximization mechanism enhances exploration capabilities and effectively balances economic and environmental objectives. For distributed virtual power plants or multi-microgrid systems, MAPPO framework is used to realize cooperative scheduling among agents, and the contradiction between local observation and global optimization is solved through centralized training-distributed execution strategy. The simulation results show that the proposed method is significantly superior to the traditional optimization algorithm in reducing the operating cost, improving the consumption rate of renewable energy and ensuring the security of power grid. In addition, the convergence speed and strategy robustness of the algorithm are further improved by introducing preferential experience playback and hierarchical reinforcement learning. This study provides a scalable solution for intelligent scheduling of high-proportion renewable energy grids."

A modified PWM (MPWM) technique is utilised to modulate the system. The MPWM results in improved output voltage profile and reduction in voltage ripple across the SCs. Moreover, the phase difference of 30-degree between the peak discharging current of the SCs and the peak line voltage further reduces the size of SCs by the factor of $\\sqrt 3 /2$. The proposed structure is quantitatively compared with the latest similar topologies to demonstrate the advantages in the terms of less components count, low maximum blocking voltage (MBV), low total standing voltage (TSV), lessened total harmonic distortion (THD), lowered cost function (CF) per level, and boosted output voltage.

Tomato leaf disease has an important impact on agricultural production, and thus early and precise detection is essential. Deep learning architectures have been used to replace human inspection, minimizing errors and inefficiencies and enhancing disease detection. The models utilize neural networks to automatically extract relevant patterns from images, enhancing detection rates. But conventional models VGG19 (Visual Geometry Group), ResNet50 (Residual Network), and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are plagued by high computational complexity and overfitting, hindering real-world applications. These drawbacks result in inefficient feature extraction, rendering them inappropriate for resource-limited environments and large-scale deployment. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an EfficientNetB3-based model optimized for maximum feature extraction and computational efficiency. Our model utilizes depth-wise convolution and improved parameter efficiency to enhance accuracy and robustness. With 95.8% classification accuracy, it outperforms current architectures significantly in the detection of tomato leaf disease."

Fruit quality must be maintained since it influences handling, storage, marketing, and consumer acceptance after harvest. The fruit detection and quality evaluation process may be delayed and inconsistent if manual inspection is used exclusively. For accurate fruit evaluation, HSI offers a non-destructive substitute because of its capacity to gather both spectral and spatial information. However, HSI data often suffers from noise, uneven lighting, and artifacts, necessitating effective pre-processing. Techniques such as Nearest Neighbor Interpolation (NNI) for normalization, CLAHE for contrast enhancement, and Median Filtering(MF) for noise removal help improve image clarity and reliability. Following pre-processing, the You Only Look Once(YOLO) algorithm is applied for fast and accurate fruit detection and quality. This conceptual approach enhances the precision, efficiency of fruit detection and quality evaluation in agricultural applications."

We developed a deep learning diagnostic approach that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a Transformer encoder to enable rapid and accurate classification of osteosarcoma and bone callus in high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs). A retrospective analysis was performed on 62 cases (29 osteosarcoma and 33 bone callus) confirmed between April 2022 and December 2024 at the Shandong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. From these cases, 274 regions of interest (ROIs) measuring 256×256 pixels were annotated. To enhance data quality, we designed a rigorous image preprocessing pipeline—which included Gaussian filtering for denoising, Reinhard color normalization, and horizontal flipping—to ensure consistency in color and brightness across different slides. The model initially extracts local features using a multi-layer convolutional module, then flattens the resultant feature maps into a sequence of tokens. Positional encoding is used to preserve spatial information, and the Transformer encoder subsequently employs a self-attention mechanism to capture global contextual features. Finally, global average pooling and a fully connected layer complete the classification task. Experimental results demonstrated that our model achieved an accuracy of 0.80, a sensitivity of 0.89, and a specificity of 0.71 in distinguishing osteosarcoma from bone callus in pathological images. These performance metrics surpass those of comparative models such as ResNet50, SVM, and a basic CNN, underscoring the high diagnostic efficiency and objectivity of this deep learning-based multi-level feature fusion method.

While rule-based aggregation and greedy heuristics have been widely used, they optimize only short-term performance and degrade under uncertainty. To address this, we present a simple yet effective solution by modeling WSN transmission scheduling as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and applying classical dynamic programming-based reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Value Iteration and Policy Iteration. Simulation results show that these methods significantly reduce long-term estimation error and conserve energy compared to greedy baselines, highlighting their effectiveness in balancing accuracy and sustainability in resourceconstrained environments."

    "abstract": "Pitch controllers are used in wind turbines to limit electrical power in strong and violent winds and can be complex, limited, and costly, whereas they should be robust, simple, and low-cost. They aim to facilitate the integration of wind energy into the electrical grid and optimize the stability of wind turbines. It is in this context that we evaluated the performance of a simple pitch angle regulator for an E 115/3 MW wind turbine under wind conditions in Benin. The pitch regulator is based on a simple proportional corrector with memory that controls the entire range of wind speeds allowed for turbine operation. The efficiency of the corrector is evaluated by applying realistic and strong winds to the turbine inlet. Our regulator limits electrical power to its nominal value for all wind speeds between 11.5 m/s and 25 m/s and optimizes power at low winds. This capability of the regulator demonstrates its robustness. Based on a proportional corrector, it is simple and inexpensive. It is suitable for high-power variable-speed wind turbines and facilitates their integration into a stability optimization algorithm."

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models become integral to network operations, their lack of transparency poses a significant barrier to operator trust. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques often fail to bridge this gap for non-specialists, producing technical outputs that are difficult to translate into actionable insights. This paper presents a framework specifically designed to address this shortcoming. It leverages a moderately sized large language model (LLM) and extends beyond the standard use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature influence values. The framework employs a structured prompt enriched with mutual feature interaction data to generate human-understandable natural language explanations. To validate our framework, we performed an empirical evaluation on an optical quality of transmission (QoT) estimation use case with human evaluators. We collected independent performance evaluations from specialists, which showed a high inter-evaluator agreement. Compared to a state-of-the-art baseline that uses only SHAP feature influence values in a straightforward prompt, our approach improves the explanation usefulness and scope by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 2. 2 \\%}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{6. 2 \\%}$</tex>, while achieving 97.5% correctness."

    "abstract": "Contemporary text-to-image diffusion models, including FLUX.1-Dev and Stable Diffusion, exhibit representational bias stemming from their reliance on large-scale datasets that are potentially skewed towards certain ethnic distributions or rather lack of such diverse data in the training datasets. This imbalance results in systematic misrepresentation of underrepresented populations, such as Sri Lankans, in synthesised imagery. To address this gap, we construct a culturally curated dataset comprising 200 high-resolution facial images of Sri Lankan individuals, capturing intra-ethnic diversity across morphological features, skin tones, and traditional attire. We then perform full-parameter fine-tuning of the FLUX.1-Dev architecture-an advanced diffusion transformer model-on this dataset, employing conditional flow-matching objectives and a high-fidelity training pipeline optimised for cultural fidelity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal that the fine-tuned model exhibits markedly improved performance in generating faces consistent with Sri Lankan ethnomorphological characteristics. As part of this work, a human perceptual study (n <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=134)$</tex> was conducted to assess the realism and cultural alignment of generated images.

Consequently, achieving lightweight security authentication and communication protection across vast numbers of heterogeneous devices has become an urgent priority. This paper proposes a lightweight network authentication scheme for distributed energy, energy storage, and charging pile systems based on quantum cryptography technology (Charging Pile Key Management Scheme, CPKMS). By integrating pre-shared symmetric keys with public key certificate mechanisms, it ensures efficient and secure network authentication and data transmission for terminal devices operating in resource-constrained environments. Analysis demonstrates that this scheme possesses resistance to forgery attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and replay attacks, balancing security and efficiency to meet the security requirements for network access key management in distributed energy storage and charging pile systems."

By dividing the light spectrum, a multi-junction (MJ) solar cell (GaInP/GaInAs/Ge) can harvest additional radiant power harnessed from the sunlight than a monojunction PV module. When two or more single-junction cells are stacked to produce MJSCs, the productivity of the cell is increased. The MPPT mode in the MATLAB/Simulink environment is utilized to enhance the conversion efficiency and maximize the PV modules’ output power. By modifying various environmental parameters such as temperature and irradiance within a MATLAB/Simulink platform, and utilizing the I-V and P-V characteristics of MJSCs, maximum performance potentially achieved. Perturb and Observe ($\\mathbf{P}$ and $\\mathbf{O}$) MPPT algorithm is used, which is the simplest, easiest, and suitable for PV applications. At the end, the procedure was used to determine how temperature and irradiance influence the production of power.

The slot pair is symmetrically etched on the top metal of the quarter-mode substrate integrated waveguide (QMSIW) resonator, occupying no additional area. Its well-designed configuration avoids radiation loss while generating transmission zeros (TZs). By combining perturbation vias with the slot pair in a single QMSIW cavity, multiple modes are effectively exploited to construct a wideband response.

It introduces a hierarchical feature fusion encoder, a temporal attention-context decoder, and a pose consistency loss to jointly improve feature extraction, temporal stability, and geometric constraints.

First, a DNN model is trained to design structures of the bend-resistant PCF according to the given optical performance. Then, Shapley additive interpretation (SHAP), a kind of XAI algorithm is employed to optimize the pre-trained DNN model with feature analysis. The features with higher SHAP values are selected from the original input data to reduce the input data dimension of the pre-trained DNN. When the input data dimension is reduced from 33 to 11, the number of model parameters is decreased by 87.9%. The design accuracy of the optimized DNN is 94.4%, and the total design time of the optimized model is only 0.024 seconds. The results show that the proposed method reduces the computational load and improves the efficiency of photonic crystal fiber design. The designed bend-resistant photonic crystal fibers have excellent performance and are easy to be manufactured. This can also offer an alternative method for the design of various optical devices."

Therefore, based on statistical theory and a thorough investigation of cell degradation mechanisms and models, the statistical degradation models of packs for any configurations are pioneeringly developed through theoretical derivation. These models consider cell-to-cell variations, apply to various lithium-ion battery types and operating conditions, and are verified through Monte Carlo simulation. Based on these models, the pack state-of-health (SOH) statistics can be quickly and accurately obtained to quantify their degradation characteristics. Furthermore, the pack reliability can be efficiently assessed by integrating these models with the universal generating function (UGF) method. The results demonstrate that both parallel and series configurations enhance the pack-level SOH consistency. The SOH consistency in parallel modules with four cells is improved by 50% over cell-to-cell. After 3,000 cycles, a 10°C temperature variation caused pack reliability to decrease from 0.9343 to 0 (the lower the reliability, the greater the probability of failure occurring in a batch of packs). Moreover, packs with cells firstly connected in parallel and then in series exhibit superior SOH statistical performance and reliability. It has significant applications in pack configuration optimization, cell screening, and echelon utilization of retired packs."

Using a human-annotated dataset summarized into colloquial Thai from Supreme Court decisions, this work investigates a different combination of NLP, ML, and rule-based techniques for accurate legal case analysis as per Thai law, especially property-related offences, with the intuition to imitate the lawyer’s cognitive process. We experimented with two major tasks, binary and multi-label classification, evaluated using a five-fold cross-validation method. The binary classification was performed to discern property-related cases from other criminal offences, while the multi-label task associates the case with specific property-related offences, including theft, snatching, robbery, and gang robbery. We achieved exceptional performance for the former task for average accuracy and F1-score, reaching 94.2% and 96.7%, respectively, together with an intriguing finding that solely vanilla fastText, a static embedding, is enough for such a task. For the part of multi-label classification, we obtained a remarkable result of 82.0% in average zero-one accuracy and 92.0% in average Hamming accuracy, with the fine-tuned joint embedding classification pipeline incorporating rulebased post-processing, showing an improvement from without the rule-based technique. This highlights the possibility of integrating the symbolic information from a rule-based algorithm together with the statistical computation from machine learning techniques in performing a complex legal analysis task."

    "abstract": "Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) suffers from reduced accuracy when measuring surfaces with complex reflectivity, resulting from image saturation in high-reflectivity regions and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in low-reflectivity regions. Although adaptive fringe projection (AFP) methods effectively mitigate these issues, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: spatial misalignment caused by oversimplified pixel mapping paradigms, and low efficiency due to excessive pattern projections. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient adaptive fringe projection framework for high dynamic range (HDR) 3D measurement, which combines phase differential mapping with residual-robust optimization. First, we introduce a two-stage mapping method: an initial coarse one-to-one mapping using low‑grayscale uniaxial fringe patterns, followed by a refined many-to-many correspondence established via phase differential matrices. This significantly alleviates spatial misalignment while reducing the number of required projection patterns. Second, we develop a residual-robust optimization framework for estimating the projector’s pixel-wise maximum input gray level (MIGL) directly from mapped intensity pairs, without the need for additional uniform grayscale projections. The framework incorporates residual-adaptive weighting and spatial smoothing to ensure robust estimation under limited and low-SNR data conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces projection patterns to 14, compared to over 27 in existing HDR techniques, while achieving competitive performance and superior point cloud completeness across various complex reflective surfaces."

Here, a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits confidential information to both indoor and outdoor users via STAR-RIS using an energy-splitting protocol. We consider multiple terrestrial homogeneous Poisson point process eavesdroppers located in reflecting and transmitting regions that can intercept the BS’s transmitted signal. To ensure secure communication, we formulate a secrecy rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the BS beamforming vectors and the transmission and reflection coefficients of the STAR-RIS. Furthermore, we reformulate the optimization problem as a constrained Markov decision process, considering both system dynamics and problem tractability. To solve it efficiently, we employ a deep reinforcement learning technique, i.e., the constrained soft actor-critic algorithm. Numerical analysis confirms that the proposed framework achieves superior secrecy performance compared to benchmark methods."

    "abstract": "Protein kinases play an important role in cellular activities like cell division, growth, metabolism, etc, implicating diseases, particularly cancer. Covalent inhibitors are promising inhibitors due to their higher specificity and permanent binding with the protein. Predicting a covalent inhibitor with specific kinase proteins is a challenge. This paper compares different methods for classifying covalent and non-covalent inhibitors of P0DTD1 (replicase polyprotein 1ab), including traditional fingerprint-based models, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Large Language Models (LLMs). Various methods to handle the class imbalance of 365 molecules in covalent and 5892 molecules in non-covalent class, with upsampling, class weights, and transfer learning were experimented. The results indicate that LLM with upsampling and transfer learning has the highest performance (F1 scores of 0.95+), but GNN architectures with relevant class balancing techniques showed concrete results despite dataset imbalance. The experiments provides valuable insight for development of computational methods in drug discovery, particularly in identifying potential covalent inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Object detection plays a crucial role in the fields of biophysics, cell detection, and organelle counting. Existing cell detection models struggle with low accuracy due to Blurred images and low resolution of tiny targets in images, which makes it difficult to detect and locate cells and organelles. This paper This paper combines super-resolution technology of ESRGAN with object detection technology of yololl. Firstly, a high resolution and training method is raised to improve the training quality of object detection models. Secondly, a ROI-Guided Super-Resolution for Inference method is introduced to fuse yolo and ESRGAN, which optimized the detection methods for blurred and tiny targets. Finally, the neck part of yolo is modified with a multi-directional neck to enhance the perception ability of detection models for tiny targets. Experimental results show that using a 4x super-resolution dataset for training, combined with a 2x super-resolution training strategy and detection data preprocessing method, can achieve the best performance of the optimized HRCyolo object detection model. Compared to the baseline model, HRCyolo achieves an overall improvement of 6.5% in mAP50-95 on the DR-Narin-2 dataset, with notable gains of 21.7% and 3.06% specifically for Blasts and Erythrocytes. This approach effectively breaks through the bottleneck of traditional detection models in recognizing small targets such as blast and Erythrocyte in fuzzy scenes, and improves the detection accuracy of multi-scale cell datasets."

    "abstract": "Fetal diseases often lead to complications, but with the help of machine learning models in modern healthcare, early-stage assessment and detection are now possible. The quality of care (QoC) provided to expectant mothers may be risked by human error, biases, and high operational costs, along with traditional diagnostic procedures, which frequently rely on clinical judgment. The women in underprivileged areas, where access to professional medical experts is limited, these issues are a serious concern. This study introduces a computer system that uses machine learning (ML) to predict fetal health by analyzing cardiotocographic (CTG) data and classifying fetal conditions as normal, suspicious, or abnormal. Fetal heart rate (FHR), uterine contractions (UC), accelerations, decelerations, and statistical metrics like histogram width and variance are among the crucial physiological data that the system examines. We thoroughly assessed numerous ML methods using public datasets from the popular CTG dataset, obtained from the UCI repository. The SVM classifier had the highest prediction accuracy among all of the models tested, indicating that it was better at detecting risk in pregnancies with the negligible error. This strategy improves access to high-quality prenatal care by lowering reliance on the availability of specialists. It also helps to make timely, evidence-based decisions. The resulting technique will enhance maternal healthcare services by enabling faster, more inclusive, and reliable fetal health evaluations."

    "abstract": "The rapid increase in the use of electric vehicles (EVs) has made household and commercial EV charging stations major contributors to power quality problems. Power electronic converters used in EV chargers are nonlinear in nature. These nonlinear loads put more strain on the electrical distribution system, lower power factor, and create current harmonics. To reduce current harmonics and control reactive power in a single-phase EV charging system, this research introduces a shunt active power filter (SAPF) based on model predictive control (MPC). MATLAB/Simulink is used to model and simulate the suggested system. By minimizing a cost function based on reference current tracking error, a MPC method is created to choose inverter switching states as efficiently as possible. A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is used to control the DC link voltage, guaranteeing energy balance throughout the filter. The SAPF improves source current and complies with IEEE 519 harmonic requirements by injecting compensating currents that eliminate harmonic components drawn by the charger. When compared with the traditional filtering techniques, a considerable reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD), an improvement in power factor, and improved dynamic performance are observed in the simulation results."

Furthermore, to fully incorporate relevant external knowledge, our method retrieves common sense knowledge concepts from the semantic network to combine with the text to construct a directed isomorphic graph for each sample. Finally, an attention mechanism is used to fuse the learned feature representations from the two modules for implicit hate speech detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs well in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, offering an effective solution for detecting implicit hate speech on social media."

    "abstract": "In edge computing environments, edge servers are often subject to uncertainties such as hardware failures and link interruptions, which can degrade the quality of user experience (QoE). As a result, service robustness—the ability to maintain service continuity when servers fail—becomes particularly critical under limited budget constraints K. Existing studies predominantly adopt greedy algorithms, which offer computational efficiency but lack sufficient global search capability and adaptability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an enhanced algorithm that integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with a Top-K refinement strategy. Specifically, PSO leverages its strong global search capability to explore a diverse set of candidate deployment solutions, while the subsequent Top-K refinement mechanism performs localized optimization and selection to retain and reinforce high-quality solutions. This synergistic approach effectively combines the complementary strengths of global exploration and local exploitation, significantly improving the robustness of deployment solutions in uncertain environments. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms three baseline approaches in terms of robustness, thereby validating its effectiveness in enhancing the stability and reliability of edge network services."

Herein, flexible contact surfaces with different materials and topography were applied to a piezoelectric inchworm actuator, and experimental tests revealed that the actuator achieved maximum velocity of 17821.1 μm/s after laser surface treatment, representing a nearly 78% enhancement compared to its original aluminum alloy surface. Similarly, surface modifications with polyimide and shape memory alloy demonstrated velocity improvements of 21% and 57% respectively. The laser-processed surface and spin-coated polyimide surface also enhanced load capacity, reaching a maximum payload of 240 g. These results demonstrate that significant performance improvements in piezoelectric actuators can be achieved through proper surface modifications"

Prior research has explored using imitation learning to learn navigation policies that generate weather-aware flight routes based on off-line pilot demonstrations. However, the dynamic nature of weather and the evolving aircraft state make executing these learned policies difficult. This paper proposes an iterative method for generating and implementing learned policies over a receding horizon. By employing a receding horizon strategy, a new route is generated at each cycle, considering the latest environmental and aircraft conditions. Only a small segment of the route is executed before the process repeats until the destination is reached. This frequent updating of states enhances adaptability and resilience to weather variations and update delays, as demonstrated in simulations using NEXRAD data. Initial findings, reviewed and evaluated by our test pilots, suggest a promising avenue for this research."

Performance comparison between the conventional LQR and the proposed LQR-WOA method reveals significant improvements in key time-domain metrics. For instance, the LQR-WOA achieves a rise time of 0.877 s, settling time of 2.89 s, compared to 2.369 s, 4.077 s, respectively for conventional LQR in the X-axis. Similar improvements are observed for other axes, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The breakthrough development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology provides an efficient solution for high-precision image acquisition of bridge surfaces, but the intelligent analysis of massive detection data still faces major challenges. The research innovatively proposes an intelligent detection framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement learning: through convolutional neural networks, damage features such as cracks, peeling, and corrosion in unmanned aerial vehicle aerial images are automatically extracted, and reinforcement learning is applied to construct a dynamic decision-making model to achieve the autonomous optimal configuration of the detection workflow. This system effectively solves key technical problems such as multi-scale feature recognition of bridge structures and adaptive detection of irregular components under complex lighting conditions. Its self-optimization learning mechanism significantly improves the accuracy and generalization ability of defect recognition. The research results will provide a next-generation detection paradigm that is safer, more efficient, and has evolutionary capabilities for the maintenance of intelligent infrastructure."

The solar PV module operates under an Incremental Conductance (IC) Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm to extract maximum available power.

Green hydrogen serves as a chemical energy carrier that can be used in a flexible manner and a clean and flexible energy storage medium. The techno-economic analysis investigates hydrogen production from PVs, which can be installed at commercial locations such as platform sheds at Howrah junction, where hydrogen can be utilized as fuel; the location is selected due to the difficulty in storage and transportation, therefore to be used as continuously running fuel. With a 55.61 kW PV system, the hydrogen produced can power trains for 1631.81 km annually with an estimated energy value of 47.4 MWh.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a firefly algorithm (FA), optimized control strategy for a STATCOM-integrated DC microgrid-based EV charging infrastructure powered by photovoltaic (PV) array and energy storage (ES), seamlessly interfaced with the AC grid. Maintaining the DC bus voltage stability is critical challenge under the fluctuations in solar power and load demand. By enabling real-time reactive power compensation, the STATCOM enhances AC voltage stability, which in turn ensures steady DC bus performance and improved system reliability. To capture the system’s dynamic behaviour, an integrated homogeneous small-signal model is developed. The FA is utilized to fine-tune the state feedback control matrix k, delivering rapid state regulation, superior damping of oscillations, and reduced settling time. The MATLAB simulation results demonstrate that the FA-optimized control significantly outperforms over conventional state feedback methods, with improvements in transient response, reduced overshoot and undershoot, and enhanced overall stability. The proposed control framework not only ensures uninterrupted and efficient EV charging but also offers remarkable flexibility and resilience under real-world dynamic conditions, positioning it as a robust solution for next-generation EV charging systems."

    "abstract": "The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in healthcare has revolutionized patient monitoring and medical data collection, but it has also introduced new vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Ensuring the security of these connected medical devices is essential to maintain patient safety and system reliability. In this study, we propose a lightweight semi-generative deep learning framework based on a Variational Autoencoder (SG-VAE) for detecting attacks in IoT-based healthcare systems. The model compresses high-dimensional network traffic into a latent representation using the VAE encoder and employs a classification head to detect potential cyber threats directly from the latent space. Unlike conventional generative models focused on input reconstruction, our SG-VAE leverages the generative structure purely for efficient and effective classification, resulting in a high-throughput, real-time system in resource-constrained environments. To enhance transparency and interpretability, we integrate two eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques, SHAP and LIME, to provide insights into model decisions, helping stakeholders understand which features influence predictions most. Experimental results on a publicly available IoT-based ICU healthcare security dataset demonstrate that our model achieves near-perfect accuracy, 1.00, and high throughput, 54,286 samples/second, making it both highly effective and practical for deployment in real-world healthcare systems.

To resolve this challenge, advanced Maximum Power Point Tracking techniques have been developed to ensure optimal power extraction. This review focuses on three cutting-edge MPPT —Incremental Conductance with Differential Optimization (INC-DFO), Sovereign Butterfly Optimization (SBO), and Whale Optimization with Differential Evolution (WODE)—which have shown promising results in handling rapid shading transitions. These techniques are evaluated based on key performance parameters, including tracking speed, accuracy, adaptability to shading patterns, robustness, computational complexity, and convergence behavior. The analysis highlights that while INC-DFO offers moderate tracking speed and reliability, SBO provides the fastest and most robust convergence. WODE achieves a balance between precision and computational efficiency, making it an ideal choice for real-time applications. This review serves as a critical resource for researchers and engineers seeking efficient MPPT strategies to enhance PV system performance under dynamic shading scenarios."

Conventional filtering methods don’t sufficiently strike a compromise between preserving ambient features and suppressing noise. This work suggests a unique technique for improved radiosonde signal processing and contaminant removal that makes use of autocorrelation spectral density (ASD). In order to identify and suppress non-physical spectrum components while maintaining fine-scale atmospheric structures, we estimate the ASD directly from the autocorrelation functions of radiosonde measurements (wind speed, temperature, and humidity). Using the distinctive frequency signatures of identified contaminants, a dynamic spectral mask is created. Better vertical resolution of wind shear, more distinct cloud boundary identification, and increased data quality for integration into numerical weather prediction models are all demonstrated by the results of radiosonde datasets collected throughout a variety of weather scenarios."

In this paper Vehicle to Grid (V2G) based discharging and delayed charging is proposed for reducing the CaA and thereby improving the battery longevity. The V2G is utilized during the peak demand time and aiding the demand response management. The delayed charging is employed by accessing the user’s need of use date and time with IoT. The charging and V2G is implemented with a bidirectional charger. The SoC estimation with combination of Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) method and Coulomb Counting (CoC) method is used for implementing V2G and delayed charging effectively.

In this paper, a Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS)-based approach is proposed. In order to increase overall drive efficiency-a crucial component of EV performance and range-MTPA control is frequently used to produce the maximum torque with a minimum amount of current. However, due to the variation in the q axis inductance, which cause a deviation from the optimal current trajectory, its efficiency declines under dynamic operating conditions. An MRAS-based online estimation mechanism that adjusts to variations in the motor’s ‘ $\\mathrm{L}_{\\mathrm{q}}$ ‘, has been integrated into a closed-loop MTPA control framework in order to overcome this constraint. To keep the machine under MTPA condition of operation, the MRAS observer dynamically modifies the reference current vector and estimates the fluctuating inductance. The proposed model’s suitability for high-performance EV drive systems is demonstrated by simulation results, which confirm its robustness and effectiveness under varying load and speed conditions."

It successfully blends efficient learning, spatial information preservation, and feature extraction. The U-Net’s encoder path captures semantic features, and its decoder refines those features for precise localization. This method has been assessed on two different datasets, and encouraging outcomes were found. Because our model generates higher validation accuracy, it produces findings on these datasets that are equivalent to the state-of-the-art approaches. Gradientweighted class activation mapping is also used to increase this model’s explainability.

    "abstract": "The dung beetle optimization algorithm, as an emerging metaheuristic algorithm, is currently only applicable to single-objective optimization problems. However, practical problems usually involve multiple conflicting objectives, and a multi-objective optimization approach is needed to address them. To this end, a multi-objective dung beetle optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper, which extends the ability of the dung beetle optimization algorithm to be applied in multi-objective scenarios by introducing strategies such as non-dominated sorting strategy and congestion distance. To evaluate the multi-objective dung beetle optimizer's performance, this paper selects the ZDT series of standard test functions for experiments and compares and analyzes them with other multi-objective algorithms. The experimental results show that the Pareto solution sets generated by the multi-objective dung beetle optimization algorithm are excellent in both convergence and distribution: in the objective space, their solution sets approximate the theoretical Pareto front better than the comparison algorithms, and the inverted generational distance is significantly lower. These results fully demonstrate that the multi-objective dung beetle optimization algorithm possesses stronger global exploration capability and stable performance when addressing complex multi-objective problems."

Human-computer interaction (HCI) ensures the design and accessibility of technologies to increase the participation of people. However, people struggling with visual ability suffer more than others while interacting with digital devices. Towards this direction, gesture-based computer interaction is popularising among visually impaired people (VIP). To improve HCI, it is essential to minimize the level of cognitive load experienced by VIP. In this context, a novel approach using galvanic skin response (GSR) attached to the VIP foot has been used to assess the real-time cognitive load while interacting with hand gesture-based applications. The experiment is carried out with 19 participants and numerous classifiers to identify the level of cognitive load. It has been found that XGBoost and CatBoost classifiers classify the binary classification with $86.15 \\%$ and $86.79 \\%$ accuracy. The results advocate that GSR attached to the foot is a potential physiological measurement to classify the cognitive load while interacting with hand dominated applications. This is evident that, the effectiveness of GSR and foot-based features is excellent in real time classification of the cognitive load."

    "abstract": "With an exponentially increased adoption of renewable energy sources, integration of solar power into electrical Indian grid has become a crucial step to achieve sustainable and efficient power systems. This paper focuses on the load flow and short circuit analysis of the 33/11kV Vishrambag substation, simulated with help of ETAP software, while incorporation of solar panels into the grid. The study aims to evaluate the operational performance of the substation, which includes voltage profiles, power losses, and fault current levels, under different operational scenarios. The single line diagram of the substation is updated to include solar power generation, allows an in-depth assessment of its impact on the distribution network. The load flow analysis disclosed significant improvements in voltage regulation and reduced power losses due to the integration of solar energy, which supplements conventional sources while peak demand. The short circuit analysis highlighted changes in fault current levels, necessitates a review of current protective equipment to ensure operational safety and reliability. The results emphasize the potential of solar integration in improvement of grid performance and also address challenges like higher fault currents and system upgrades required for efficient operation. This study provides valuable insights into the technical implications of renewable energy integration, which serves as a reference for utility Engineer and researchers who work on similar tasks. To demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of solar adoption, this paper contributes to the efforts to modernize substations and promote sustainable energy solutions in power distribution systems.."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional spatial information is widely used across many fields, and the need for measurement techniques that provide high accuracy, precision, and robustness to environmental variation is increasingly critical. This paper addresses wiggling caused by harmonics of the modulation wave-form in Indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) and proposes a method that simultaneously corrects distance and amplitude without hardware modification. We employ a harmonic model designed for real signals and estimate residual harmonic components via prior calibration. We then use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), with the Interior Point Method (IPM) applied as post-processing, to estimate the model parameters from the calibration data. In the online stage, we apply Newton's method to a single frame, thereby removing wiggling in both distance and amplitude. Experiments at modulation frequencies of 12, 18, and 24 MHz confirm consistency between the model and measurements. At 12 MHz the distance Mean Absolute Error (MAE) decreases from 7.30 cm to 0.89 cm after 1 iteration and converges to 0.87 cm within <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2-3$</tex> iterations, demonstrating convergence speed and reproducibility. Because only four parameters per pixel are stored, memory demand is lower than prior-data-based corrections, and convergence within two or three iterations per frame supports practicality. The approach is also expected to be effective when combined with Multi-Path Interference (MPI) mitigation."

This paper presents a MATLAB-based framework for short-term PV power prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained on local weather station measurements and Meteosat satellite data. The dataset includes irradiance components, cloud index, albedo, air temperature, wind speed, and cyclic time features. Preprocessing involves synchronization, resampling, normalization, and performance ratio (PR)-based energy yield calculation. A Multi-Layer Perceptron ANN trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is employed. Experimental results show that the ANN significantly outperforms a conventional GHI-PR baseline, reducing mean absolute error from 48.6~Wh to 12.4~Wh and root mean squared error from 65.2~Wh to 18.7~Wh, while capturing both seasonal variability and intra-day fluctuations. The proposed framework demonstrates that ANN-based approaches provide accurate and flexible PV forecasts and can be extended with advanced irradiance models, explicit temperature corrections, and deep learning architectures for multi-horizon prediction."

The framework dynamically regulates maximum power point tracking (MPPT), manages battery charging and discharging, and improves load prioritization in real time.

However, its adoption is hindered by serious concerns around security, transparency, and trust. To address these challenges, a modular multi-layered blockchain architecture is proposed for online voting platforms with a focus on fairness, decentralization, and auditability. Blockchain’s inherent properties: immutability, distributed consensus, and transparency, make it a promising foundation for ensuring tamper-evident, verifiable, and secure voting systems. Encompassing the most sensitive functionalities within independent layers such as data, network, consensus, incentive, and application allows for scalability, interoperability, and the safe processing of votes, irrespective of computeintensive or stake-based validator selection. The architecture supports heterogeneous node involvement (validator, full, light nodes) with a regulating Voting Authority to enforce compliance without restricting decentralization. Decoupling validation policy and consensus rules enables the integration of fairness-aware validation procedures without compromising crypto-integrity or voter anonymity. This system addresses fundamental flaws in existing consensus protocols and provides a blueprint for a secure, transparent, and trustworthy digital electoral foundation."

By leveraging human-annotated ground-truth 2D, our proposed method, a multi-camera single-object tracking algorithm, transforms 2D image coordinates into robust 3D world coordinates through homography-based projection and UKF-based fusion. Our proposed algorithm processes multi-view data to estimate object positions and shapes while effectively handling challenges such as occlusion. We evaluate our method on the CMC, Wildtrack, and Panoptic datasets, demonstrating high accuracy in 3D localization compared to the available 3D ground truth. Unlike existing approaches that provide only ground-plane information, our method also outputs the full 3D shape of each object. Additionally, the algorithm offers a scalable and fully automatic solution for multi-camera systems using only 2D image annotations."

First, an accurate building thermodynamic model is constructed based on the historical operation data of the building and the principles of thermodynamics. Secondly, the Q-Learning algorithm is designed as the core control strategy. Its state space is defined as a multivariate vector covering indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity, CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> concentration, personnel density and equipment status, and the action space covers the opening of the cold water valve, the setting of the supply air temperature and the adjustment instructions of the fresh air volume. The reward function adopts a weighted fusion method to quantitatively evaluate the energy consumption cost and the deviation of comfort. The model training and strategy optimization are first carried out on the EnergyPlus simulation platform, and then deployed to the actual HVAC system for online learning and real-time control. During the three-month winter heating season, the system reduced the overall energy consumption by 24.6% and the average time of comfort exceeding the limit is reduced by 41.9%. This reinforcement learning control system effectively solves the problem of dynamic optimization of the HVAC system, significantly achieves the dual-objective coordinated optimization of energy saving and comfort, and has good engineering application value and economic benefits."

The system was also compared and evaluated with other models such as ResNet90 and MobileNetV2. The model obtained an accuracy of 98.1%, precision of 97.9% and recall of 98.3% which showed excellent metrics that outperformed the other popular models. During the ROC analysis, the AUC obtained was 0.97 which showed that the model has a good classification performance. The model could also identify the subtle differences in the sounds produced by the bees in healthy and unhealthy hive states. This helped to enable non-invasive hive monitoring. We developed a user-friendly web interface which would help the users to easily interact with the system. This solution helps to reduce human intervention and promote a non-invasive, intelligent approach to beekeeping to encourage healthier beekeeping practices. The proposed approach is beneficial for both small-scale and commercial beekeepers, providing them with an efficient and practical solution for hive monitoring."

    "abstract": "Conventional ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) systems require vast land resources. Urban development causes price escalation of land value, resulting in high lease costs. Therefore, a comparative analysis of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for ground-mounted PV systems, along with other land-saving alternatives such as rooftop PV, floating PV, and building-integrated PV (BIPV) systems, is necessary. The present research work calculates and compares the LCOE of PV systems in 8 different Indian cities. A 1 MW PV system is considered the benchmark for simulation. Weather files and PV cost components are collected and utilized for LCOE calculations. Ground-mounted PV systems are affordable in smaller cities like Dhanbad (5.07 INR/kWh to 9.14 INR/kWh). In large cities like Mumbai and Delhi, the LCOE of land-based PV varies from 5.2 INR/kWh to 73.09 INR/kWh. The floating PV systems have LCOE between 4.44 INR/kWh and 6.64 INR/kWh. The LCOE of BIPV systems varies from 7.83 INR/kWh to 10.61 INR/kWh. PV rooftop systems are the most economical alternatives with LCOE from 4.89 INR/kWh to 5.23 INR/kWh. LCOE varies nonlinearly with the Lease escalation factor and degradation rate. The results are compared with grid electricity prices. The relative order of economic feasibility is dependent on land lease and waterbody lease cost, the presence of residential subsidy, and degradation rate. This comparative framework is aimed at helping government bodies, engineers, and researchers to enable informed decision-making in urban PV system planning."

    "abstract": "Shipborne ad hoc networks are an essential component of maritime communication systems, playing a pivotal role in fleet coordination, offshore operations, and civilian maritime communications. However, vessels often need to maintain safety distances of several kilometers, far exceeding the effective communication range of conventional IEEE 802.11 standards. Furthermore, traditional routing mechanisms, such as AODV, struggle to maintain communication stability in highly dynamic topologies and opportunistic network environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cross-layer design: at the MAC layer, directional antennas, a polling mechanism, and P-NAV table maintenance are employed to extend communication range and effectively mitigate hidden terminal and deafness issues; at the network layer, AODV routing is enhanced with an opportunistic network forwarding mechanism, dynamically selecting the optimal next-hop node when conventional paths are unavailable. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of packet loss, latency, and throughput, significantly improving the communication performance and reliability of shipborne ad hoc networks in complex maritime environments."

One of its key function is estimating the State-of-Charge (SoC), which indicates the remaining energy in the battery. Monitoring the SoC of a battery is crucial for ensuring the efficient operation of energy storage systems. Since SoC cannot be directly measured, achieving accurate estimation plays a pivotal role in enhancing both system performance and operational flexibility. Furthermore, the information provided by SoC is instrumental in ensuring the safe functioning of the storage system and prolonging the battery's lifespan by avoiding overcharging or excessive discharging. Selecting a suitable SoC estimation algorithm often involves balancing the trade-off between the complexity of the algorithm and its accuracy. Among various available methods of SoC estimation, in this paper, emphasis is given on two basic methods i. e., the Kalman Filter Method and Coulomb Counting Method. Furthermore results from both these techniques are compared to give a better overview of efficient technique. These techniques are implemented on different battery models starting from the very basic single RC model to double RC model and compared on Matlab/Simulink."

Firstly, the data is denoised, and the K-Means algorithm is used to cluster the photovoltaic output data. By calculating the abnormal score and superimposing the threshold screening algorithm, the abnormal data is finally identified, which improves the accuracy of identification. Secondly, in order to realize the correction of abnormal data, a prediction correction method based on CNNLSSVM is proposed. The feature extraction ability of convolutional neural network (CNN) and the sample regression prediction advantage of least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) are combined to improve the prediction accuracy of the model and realize the correction of abnormal photovoltaic power data. The simulation test was carried out using the photovoltaic data set of a certain area. The results show that this method can effectively deal with abnormal photovoltaic data to a certain extent, so as to improve the quality of photovoltaic data."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly permitted to operate within Visual Line of Sight (VLoS) under EU and US regulations. However, Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLoS) operations remain restricted, with waivers or certifications required. Extended Visual Line of Sight (EVLoS) offers a transitional solution, involving trained observers to assist pilots when visibility is obstructed. We propose enhancing EVLoS by integrating ground infrastructure, specifically city cameras and wireless communication networks already available on the ground, to replace human observers and enable BVLoS capabilities. Fixed and mobile cameras track drones to ensure regulatory compliance, while real-time data transmission via communication networks provides indirect oversight. The approach increases operational range, reliability, and redundancy through multi-hop connectivity. We introduce the Minimum Latency Problem (MLP), a UAV multi-trajectory optimization problem where UAVs are constantly tracked and monitored through ground antennas and city cameras, mimicking the human observers in EVLoS. Our goal is to minimize communication latency while ensuring that the number of antennas used for coverage is minimum. We prove MLP is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N P$</tex>-hard and propose an algorithm to solve it.

Extensive research literature explores various MPPT algorithms. Simultaneously, controllers designed to minimize tracking errors are equally important. Among them Proportional-Integral (PI) controller is popular due to its simplicity and effectivenes particularly for linear control systems. However, these controllers do not adapt well to the non- linear and dynamic nature of PV environment. In these scenarios, Sliding Mode Control (SMC) demonstrates greater robustness. However, the SMC utilizes a discontinous control law thereby causing chattering. On the other hand the super twisting sliding mode control (ST-SMC) provides continous control signals thereby eliminating chattering.

The resulting closed-loop system has additional terms due to the sampling compared with the case using the continuous measurements. We suggest appropriate Lyapunov functionals to obtain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for finding the upper bounds on the sampling that guarantees the globally exponential stability of a shifted equilibrium.

    "abstract": "Industrial multiprocess collaborative optimization presents significant challenges due to the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in modern process industries. Traditional optimization and reinforcement learning often treat subprocesses as independent entities, neglecting the fine-grained interdependencies among operational variables across different subprocesses. To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce, a novel spatiotemporal topology-informed multiprocess collaborative optimization (STI-MCO) framework, which pioneers action-level interdependency modeling through an innovative spatiotemporal graph architecture. Rather than treating subprocesses as monolithic entities, STI-MCO operates at the operational variable level, enabling precise representation of both interprocess relationships and intraprocess dependencies through a hierarchical two-stage decision framework. This approach enables more precise coordination through fine-grained variable interactions, better temporal consistency via dynamic graph structures, and enhanced scalability compared with conventional agent-level methods. This paradigm shift from subprocess-level to variable-level collaboration, combined with dynamic graph-based coordination, enables extensive simulations and experiments conducted across three benchmark environments with progressively complex topologies to demonstrate that STI-MCO consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to 38.9% improvement over centralized methods and 171.9% improvement over existing multiagent strategies. In addition, STI-MCO exhibits superior convergence efficiency, requiring significantly fewer training steps to achieve high performance. Its practical applicability is further validated through deployment in a real-world Salt Lake chemical process. By fundamentally shifting the optimization paradigm from holistic subprocess control to fine-grained variable-level collaboration, this work establishes a new framework for more effective optimization in complex industrial processes, particularly those with strong interunit coupling."

In this method, the initial coarse alignment of SINS is transformed from the constrained optimization problem in Euclidean space to an unconstrained optimization problem in Manifold space. There are two innovations in this method: the first is the optimization method of gradient descent in Euclidean space, which is reviewed and extended to manifold space. By combining the trust region method with the Barzilai-Borwein method, the optimal selection of the iterative update step on the tangent space of the manifold is realized, which ensures the efficient and stable convergence of the algorithm. Secondly, the Cayley transform is used to construct the retraction mapping, and its closed form analytic solution and structure preservation characteristics are used to effectively suppress the error accumulation caused by numerical approximation, so as to ensure that the iterative points on the tangent space of the manifold are mapped to the manifold space. The experiment results indicate that the proposed coarse alignment method performs better than the existing methods."

To address these challenges, we introduce <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</b>odel-based <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</b>ffline <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</b>einforcement learning with <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</b>dversaria<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</b> data augmentation (MORAL). In MORAL, we replace the fixed horizon rollout by employing adversarial data augmentation to execute alternating sampling with ensemble models to enrich training data. Specifically, this adversarial process dynamically selects ensemble models against policy for biased sampling, mitigating the optimistic estimation of fixed models, thus robustly expanding the training data for policy optimization. Moreover, a differential factor (DF) is integrated into the adversarial process for regularization, ensuring error minimization in extrapolations. This data-augmented optimization adapts to diverse offline tasks without rollout horizon tuning, showing remarkable applicability. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that MORAL outperforms other model-based offline RL methods in terms of policy learning and sample efficiency."

    "abstract": "Waveform design is expected as the core of uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to provide distributed sensing capability in the 6th generation (6G) mobile communication. The widely used orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform in communication systems suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), while conventional PAPR reduction methods overlook the performance trade-offs between PAPR reduction and dual functionalities of sensing and communication. In this letter, we propose a low-PAPR waveform design method based on joint optimization of time-frequency domain statistical characteristics for uplink ISAC system, where the phase and amplitude are jointly optimized to enhance the PAPR performance without compromising sensing performance. Specifically, a low-complexity particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is derived for phase optimization, demonstrating the same sensing capability as OFDM. An exponential transformation is further applied to optimize the amplitude characteristics, achieving about 4 dB PAPR reduction compared to discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), with minimal impact on the communication bit error rate (BER). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of PAPR reduction and analyze the periodic autocorrelation function (ACF) and BER performance for dual-functionality evaluation."

Designing a secure yet efficient BTP is still a long-lasting challenge, and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a promising building block for designing BTPs. In this study, we propose a novel pre-image attack applicable to lots of existing LSH-based BTPs, showing that many of them are in fact <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">reversible</i>. Our attack leverages structural properties shared by several LSH-based BTPs. Through investigation, we formalize a certain class of LSHs vulnerable to our attack, called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PMA-LSH</i>, which contains several known LSH-based BTPs, even not-yet-cryptanalyzed ones. Furthermore, the recovered pre-image from our attack is much closer to the original template compared to previous attacks, facilitating recovery of the original biometrics via reconstruction attacks. With existing reconstruction methods, we successfully recovered biometrics from templates protected by several LSH-based BTPs. The recovered biometrics sufficiently resemble the original ones, so they can be further exploited to impersonate other recognition systems, including commercial APIs.

Based on the receive-transmit (R-T) structure, a guided-wave layer with a multi-stage stepped impedance stripline is introduced in the middle layer. This structure exploits the impedance mismatch mechanism to achieve independent regulation of transmission amplitude. At the same time, continuous phase adjustment across a wide frequency range is enabled by rotating the transmitter patch (TP). Additionally, the design offers adaptability to various incident wave polarizations by replacing the receiver patch (RP) with one exhibiting suitable polarization characteristics, without modifying the amplitude-phase control mode and the polarization state of the transmitted wave. Measured results demonstrate that the proposed metasurface (MS) antenna achieves a gain of 27 dBic, with a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 36.1%, and achieves low side lobe levels (SLLs) of −26.9 dB (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">xoz</i>-plane)/−27.1 dB (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">yoz</i>-plane) at 14.5 GHz, while obtaining a high aperture efficiency (AE) of 40.8%.

    "abstract": "Conveyor rollers are essential components in the hot steel milling process, responsible for transporting products between various stages of production throughout the entire process. Due to the development of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), conveyors are now equipped with sensors to collect real-time data, facilitating data-driven fault diagnosis models. While many well-trained data-driven diagnostic models initially demonstrate accurate performance, their effectiveness may decline over time due to unexpected changes, such as the emergence of new faults. This causes the prior distribution of fault data to change over time, and we refer to this as prior drift. In this study, we provide a mathematical definition of prior drift within the context of fault diagnosis and then develop a general learning criterion to guide the incremental updating of fault diagnosis models under such conditions. Building on this criterion, we propose an online active kernel learning-based fault diagnosis model (OAKL) for conveyor rollers. OAKL updates the diagnosis model in an incremental manner and adapts to prior drift. Particularly, it leverages selective querying and labeling of the most informative samples to facilitate early detection of novel faults, avoid performance bias, and reduce the number of incremental samples required. A rigorous theoretical analysis is conducted to demonstrate the theoretical validity of OAKL. The experimental results on a practical industrial case demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in fault diagnosis."

This leads to visual distortion and quality degradation, severely limiting its practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DM-VSR</b>, a novel DM-based framework that incorporates depth-aware guidance and adaptive modulation for precise content reconstruction.

A Timestep Adaptive Modulation (TAM) module dynamically adjusts the control feature injection according to demand at each denoising step. Additionally, a Dynamic Consistency Loss (DCL) is introduced to align training objectives with the evolving semantic focus.

    "abstract": "Cross-domain remaining useful life prediction is a critical task for industrial applications, and existing domain adaptation (DA) techniques typically focus on mitigating domain shift by learning domain-invariant features. These methods help transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, thus improving prediction accuracy and robustness. However, the alignment strategies used are often coarse-grained, which can lead to the disruption of inherent temporal dependencies in degradation data. In this article, we introduce the novel order-preserving kernel contrastive (OPKC) learning, which leverages the concept that samples with smaller label differences should exhibit higher kernel similarities in the reproducing Kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), irrespective of their domain origin. This kernel-enhanced, regression-aware contrastive learning technique enables fine-grained instance-level pairwise alignment between the source and target domains, ensuring that label difference information is preserved while maintaining the temporal order information inherent in the data. In addition, OPKC can be seamlessly integrated with adversarial DA methods to further enhance both prediction performance and training stability. Extensive experiments on two widely used industrial benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art transfer learning and contrastive learning methods, achieving relative improvement of 16.9% on the PHM 2012 dataset and 13.2% on the C-MAPSS dataset."

This article introduces a novel testing methodology, termed unified accelerated life testing (UALT), which integrates the principles of CSALT and SSALT. The UALT framework incorporates multiple test groups, each subjected to distinct stress-change patterns. By applying multiple stress-change patterns to test items, the UALT framework enhances data collection efficiency and provides a more accurate reliability estimation. The study conducts a detailed comparative analysis of these three optimal designs. Simulation results demonstrate that UALT with step-down-stress patterns achieves superior efficiency in data collection, as evidenced by smaller bias and standard deviation of reliability estimates. This innovative approach offers a nuanced understanding of how diverse stress-change patterns influence product reliability assessment. To illustrate its practical applicability, this article presents a real-world case study involving grease-based magnetorheological fluids, showcasing the effectiveness of optimal UALT design in reliability testing."

    "abstract": "A compact Ku-band multibeam relativistic klystron amplifier (MBRKA) packaged with permanent magnets is proposed for the sake of producing repetitive high-power microwave (HPM) with good phase stability. A three-gap output cavity is designed. HPM is output from the internal channel, and the electron beams are bombarded to the external water-cooled collector. Then, the radial size of the output cavity is reduced, thereby reducing the volume and weight of the permanent magnet. At the same time, the output structure can reduce the intensity of the gap electric field to avoid RF breakdown, and on the other hand, the outer collector structure increases the cross section of the electron beams bombardment, reduces the generation of plasma, and improves the stability of the device’s repetition frequency operation. Besides, the improved diode structure with an inner anode is designed to realize the stable transmission of intense relativistic multiple electron beams (IRMEBs). The typical experimental results show that the Ku-band HPM with a power of 570 MW is generated, corresponding to an efficiency of 36% and a gain of 48 dB, when the guiding magnetic field is about 0.45 T produced by the permanent magnets. The result of continuous operation for 200 s at a repetition rate of 30 Hz indicates that the MBRKA has the capability of operating at a high repetition rate with good phase stability."

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 60.5% in detection accuracy (mAP@0.5), which is 9.2 percentage points higher than the baseline YOLOv5 model and significantly outperforms mainstream models such as TPH-YOLOv5 and YOLOv5.

    "abstract": "In today's technologically advanced world, microelectronics plays a crucial role in nearly every aspect of daily life. As a result, the demand for microelectronic components has significantly increased. This surge in demand can lead to longer production times and a higher likelihood of failures in final products. Therefore, it is essential to adopt methods that enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of hardware design and verification processes. The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) is an open standard for on-chip communication interfaces. It defines a set of rules that enable structured and efficient communication within a System on Chip (SoC). One of the prominent protocols within the AMBA family is the Advanced extensible Interface (AXI). AXI is designed to facilitate high-speed data transfers between IP cores using a master-slave configuration. Known for supporting high-frequency and high-performance system architectures, AXI is well-suited for designs that require low latency and high bandwidth. Additionally, AXI maintains compatibility with other AMBA protocols such as APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) and AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus). A key feature of the AXI protocol is its separation of address, data, and control phases, which contributes to its flexibility and efficiency."

    "abstract": "Stick-slip piezoelectric actuators have attracted significant attention for applications requiring excellent comprehensive performance and simple structure. Among various performance-limiting factors, backward motion during stepping poses a major challenge, reducing positioning accuracy and speed. Although factors such as driving signal and initial preload have been extensively studied, the influence of the mover mass on stepping characteristics remains underexplored. To investigate the effect of mover mass on output performance, a typical stick-slip actuator was designed and its feasibility is verified through working principle analysis and finite element simulation. Experimental results reveal that mover mass interacts with preload, driving voltage, and frequency to jointly affect output performance. A lighter mover tends to exhibit greater backward displacement due to reduced inertia, whereas increasing the mover mass effectively enhances the smoothness of the displacement curve and improves both motion linearity and stepping stability under varying input conditions. However, excessive mover mass leads to larger actuator size, slower dynamic response, and reduced energy efficiency. By selecting appropriate design parameters, an optimal balance between mass and performance can be achieved. These findings provide theoretical and experimental guidance for improving the structure and performance of stick-slip actuators in high-precision applications."

    "abstract": "The sixth generation (6 G) wireless communication technology aims to address the growing demand for secure, low-latency wireless communication. The Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) seem to be a promising solution to tackle the above-mentioned concerns. In this paper, we examine the allocation of resources and a single-IRS-assisted multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based network where destination nodes/users are capable of realizing Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) by employing a Power Splitting (PS) technique. Our goal is to optimize the power splitting ratio, subcarrier, and power assignment to the destination nodes in order to maximize the sum-rate of the entire system while adhering to the constraints of total transmit power and harvested energy. The aforementioned issue is resolved by employing a divide-and-conquer methodology in an alternating (iterative) optimization algorithm (AO). It is evident that more IRS elements and sub-carriers are required to achieve a higher sum data rate, as indicated by our findings."

This study introduces a sophisticated methodology for forecasting markets that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to derive practical insights from extensive unorganized social networking data. In contrast to conventional forecasting methods that mostly depend on past market patterns and quantitative data, our suggested methodology integrates real-time emotions and opinion evaluation from structures such as Twitter, Reddit, and finance forums. The structure utilizes advanced NLP approaches, such as transformer-based modelling of languages (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and specialized sentimental analysis, to derive contextual and emotional attributes from generated by users material. These characteristics are then included into a hybrid ML pipeline that amalgamates ensemble models, including Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting(GB), with algorithms for deep learning such as LSTM and focus systems. The integration improves the system's capacity to identify subtle mood changes and market-relevant trends. The system employs selecting features, noise filtration, and time-aligned normalizing of data approaches to guarantee strong predicting efficiency. Comprehensive preparation processes manage slang normalizing, hashtag interpretation, and bot identification, guaranteeing that only superior data impacts predictions. This research establishes the basis for a scalable and versatile forecasts system that surpasses traditional models, facilitating more precise, prompt, and data-informed decision-making in turbulent markets influenced by public emotion. The suggested technique attained an overall accuracy of 94.4%, exhibiting enhanced prediction performance relative to current models."

Existing video watermarking methods face limitations such as quality degradation, neglect of encoding/decoding impacts, and lack of audio copyright protection. To address these, we propose an FFmpeg-based audio-visual dual watermarking framework deeply integrated into the video encoding/decoding pipeline. Our framework employs the joint selection method of interval k frames and key frames based on DINOv2 for image embedding, which leverages DINOv2's self-supervised features to jointly optimize frame selection, while adopting averageamplitude threshold screening for audio segments to ensure watermark imperceptibility. In addition, we propose a twostage voting verification that optimizes extraction accuracy via confidence voting. Our approach achieves dual-watermark crossvalidation, significantly enhancing robustness against complex attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a 0 Bit Error Rate (BER) under various attack scenarios, providing an innovative solution for multimodal digital copyright protection with notable theoretical and practical value."

It supports the testing of MUM-T strategies in dense, obstacle-rich urban settings with high physical and visual fidelity. To demonstrate its capabilities, we simulated eight threequadrotor formation patterns: Column, Line Abreast, Echelon, Vshape, Inverted-V, Triangle, Circular, and Arrow. Each formation consisted of one human-operated leader and two autonomous followers. The results revealed trade-offs between coverage, collision risk, and formation stability.

The dielectric behavior of oils, governed by their molecular composition, induces distinct shifts in the sensor’s resonant frequency and amplitude response. These variations are systematically captured and processed to extract salient features, which serve as inputs for multiple machine learning classifiers. The microwave resonant sensor operates in a non-destructive, lowpower manner, making it particularly well-suited for real-time industrial applications. A comprehensive dataset is developed by varying the permittivity of oil samples and acquiring the corresponding sensor responses. Several classifiers are trained and evaluated using the extracted resonant features to assess their capability in distinguishing between oil types. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a high classification accuracy of $99.41 \\%$ with the random forest classifier, highlighting its strong potential for automated oil identification.

    "abstract": "Small commercial electric vehicles (SCVs) used for urban logistics create multiple operational hurdles because of their increasing adoption for commercial purpose. The key problem occurs in designing efficient route schedules. Efficient coordination of charging operations remains a challenging task in this system. Electric vehicles have restricted storage capacity, which causes these issues to develop. The restricted charging infrastructure availability creates additional complications in the process. The use of small commercial electric vehicles (SCVs) in last-mile logistics has recently increased dramatically. However, this growth has led to complicated issues with scheduling the best routes between energy consumption, charging limitations, and delivery time constraints. A system combines Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA) to function. The method finds optimum assignments for SCVs between charging stops and routes. Such optimization reduces both operational and energy- related costs. This technique provides enhanced capabilities for managing vehicle weight as well as performing delivery restriction assessment. The optimized route distances, together with improved charging station efficiency and minimized vehicle downtime, are all achieved better through the MILP-based method compared to heuristic methods. MATLAB serves as the implementation platform of the proposed framework while data from real-world logistics is used for validation through tests with different fleet sizes for scalability assessment."

    "abstract": "This article investigates a fault-tolerant control (FTC) technique for space-vector modulation based direct torque control (DTC-SVM) of induction motor (IM) drives, addressing speed and current sensor faults. The three essential steps for achieving fault tolerance in a drive system are: detecting a faulty sensor, localizing the fault, and reconfiguring the control scheme using appropriate signal estimation techniques. A third-difference operator applied to the motor line current effectively detect the sensor fault while a flux-linkage observer and model reference adaptive system (MRAS)-based estimation methods reconstruct the current and speed signals, respectively after the fault. Moreover, a decision-making logic unit pinpoints the faulty sensor and automatically switches over to its corresponding estimated current or speed signal, guaranteeing uninterrupted and dependable drive system performance. The proposed FTC scheme is simple, flexible, and compatible with any IM speed control technique. Simulation and extensive testing in MATLAB/Simulink validate its effectiveness in ensuring drive system resilience against current and speed sensor failures."

    "abstract": "The recent increased demand for power with improved technological and social status of human beings has led to the development of renewable power generation systems. The wind power system is one of the fastest-growing sectors among renewable power generation systems. In the last few decades, researchers have focused on the development of large wind turbines and studied their operation and control. However small wind turbines are effective where less wind speed potential is available like in northeast India. Therefore, improving the efficiency of the small wind turbines is one of the major tasks to enhance power generation in low-intensity wind conditions. In the present study effect of the chord solidity on the pitch control of a small wind turbine is studied. A novel integral terminal sliding mode controller is designed here using damping sinusoidal-based reaching law (termed as DSRL-ITSMC) for wind turbine pitch control with variations in blade shapes. Comprehensive performance evaluations have been carried out over a wide range of speed variations, with sinusoidal and random variations in wind speed. The performance of the proposed DSRL-ITSMC controller is tested using different turbine blades and compared using established performance indices. Finally, the proposed controller performance is compared vis-à-vis a fractional order proportional-integral-derivative controller (FO-PID) controller to demonstrate the utility of our proposal."

In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is performed to investigate the atomic-scale imaging of a typical single crystal material copper in contact atomic force microscopy measurement process. Because of the interaction between cantilever tip and sample, the bending process of cantilever is simulated by passive feedback adjustment of force, and the surface topography of sample is obtained. By establishing MD model of step-like sample, the effects of scanning speed, tip shape and scanning direction on scanning accuracy are simulated, and the potential mechanism of interaction between tip and sample is explained. The above work is helpful to explore the measurement mechanism of contact AFM at atomic scale, and it is helpful for people to realize high resolution imaging with worn AFM tip."

This study proposes an optimal configuration and sizing of EV charging stations and renewable energy sources within smart grids using the Crayfish Optimization Algorithm (COA). The primary objective of the proposed method is to minimize power losses, voltage deviations, supply-demand imbalances, charging costs, and EV battery expenses. The COA-based approach enables simultaneous optimization of both EV charging infrastructure and RES integration. Its performance is benchmarked against existing techniques, including the Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Switched-capacitor multilevel inverters (SCMLIs) have emerged as a promising solution due to their ability to provide high-quality AC output with reduced power losses. However, existing designs often face challenges related to capacitor voltage balancing, high component count, and excessive switch voltage stress. This paper introduces a novel 11-level switched-capacitor inverter topology utilizing a single DC source, 12 switches, 4 capacitors, and 4 diodes, achieving a fivefold voltage gain while ensuring self-balancing of capacitor voltages without the need for additional sensors or auxiliary circuits. The proposed inverter operates with the Optimum Nearest Level Modulation (ONLM) technique, minimizing switching losses and enhancing overall efficiency. Simulation results using MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate the inverter’s performance, with a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of 7.34% without filtering, which is significantly reduced to 0.32% with the application of an LCL filter. The inverter exhibits stable operation under dynamic load variations, confirming its adaptability for real-world applications. A comparative analysis against conventional multilevel inverters further underscores its superior efficiency, reduced component count, and improved voltage quality, making it a viable and cost-effective solution for renewable energy systems, microgrids, and high-power applications."

Providing coverage with increased Spectral Efficiency in wireless backhaul networks to multi-users is challenging because of its higher deployment cost or complexity. Further, to reduce the complexity, various non-linear precoders are designed but at the expense of high spatial interference and low spectral efficiency. Hence, an optimized solution using Vector Perturbation (VP) Precoding is considered essential as it improves spectral efficiency, but it incurs increased complexity on the uplinks due to non-optimal selection of perturbing signal, which is required to scale up the transmission signals. This research proposes Pilot VP (PVP) precoding techniques in massive MIMO, where VP selection are optimized under finite/infinite lattice space, and these inputs to the baseband precoder minimize the total number of computations required to select the Radio Frequency (RF) chains for enabling scalable transmission."

This paper presents a Q-learning-based control framework for HVAC systems that optimizes energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. The system simulates a dynamic environment without the use of physical sensors, using variables such as indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, occupancy, and AC status to define the state space. A discrete action set enables the agent to either turn off the AC, increase, or decrease the temperature setpoint. The Q-learning agent interacts with the simulated environment to learn optimal control strategies by maximizing long-term rewards defined through a comfort-aware and costsensitive reward function. The reward mechanism incorporates real-time electricity pricing models, occupancy patterns, and temperature thresholds to penalize energy waste and incentivize efficient cooling. Simulation modes including manual, auto, and batch execution facilitate diverse training and testing scenarios. A Q-table with 4,320 entries supports reinforcement learning across all state-action combinations, and a web-based interface enables visualization and user interaction. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in energy usage and operational cost, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This system provides a scalable and adaptable solution for smart HVAC control in simulated or real-world implementations."

    "abstract": "Situational awareness of autonomous vehicles in urban environments heavily relies on line-of-sight sensors such as cameras, lidar, and radar. However, these visual sensors may fail to detect targets when they are occluded. In contrast, audio signals have stronger penetration capabilities, enabling human to perceive the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of sound. This directional information can also be extracted using beamforming techniques applied to multi-channel microphone arrays. In this work, we utilize a stereo microphone array to track the 2D position of a single vehicle. Such a minimal array configuration is susceptible to ambient noise and vehicle sounds leading to high variance in position estimation. To address this issue, we propose a track-before-detect (TBD) based particle filter algorithm that incorporates stereo microphone measurements for 2D vehicle tracking. The proposed method is validated using a custom dataset that includes scenarios where vehicles pass at various distances from the microphone array. Using bird's-eye view camera footage as ground truth, experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and low-variance 2D sound source tracking."

By embedding a time-dependent function into the sliding surface design, the proposed approach guarantees strict convergence at the predefined time, enhancing predictability for real-time and safety-critical applications. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is conducted to establish predefined-time stability and convergence of position and velocity errors. Moreover, the controller is robust against matched external disturbances.

Conventional approaches collect all data on a central server, which poses privacy and security issues. Federated Learning (FL) provides a decentralized alternative by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite this, standard FL methods such as FedAvg still suffer from high communication overhead due to the transmission of full model weights at each iteration, which is problematic in resourceconstrained IoT environments. To address this problem, we build upon our previously proposed communication-efficient federated learning algorithm, eXtreme Federated Learning (XFL), and extend it to IoT IDSs by incorporating attack classification capabilities within the edge nodes. This work extends the original XFL with an IoT-oriented adaptation, attack detection, and hardware testbed evaluation. At each round, XFL optimizes and sends a single neural network layer per IDS client using the block coordinate gradient descent algorithm, thus lowering communication costs, a key factor in IoT applications. We evaluate both XFL and FedAvg on a hardware testbed (10 Raspberry Pi devices) using a real-world traffic dataset (UNSW-NB15), showing that XFL achieves a 60 % reduction in communication overhead with a comparable detection accuracy. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub."

    "abstract": "Resiliency is present in everyday life, both in system design and exhibited by the operators that function within these systems. This includes the National Airspace System (NAS) where pilots and controllers make positive decisions and take preventative or corrective actions every day even in unsafe situations. Pilot safety reports filed after an event are rich text narratives that detail the conditions around an event and can provide additional context leading up to, during, and describe how the situation was resolved. This yields useful insights into the resilient positive actions and corrective steps that may have transpired to prevent a safety incident from degrading further. Analyzing large archives of these reports can be impractical for subject matter experts to properly extract evidence of resilient behavior. However, Large Language Models have demonstrated the potential to extract useful insights from extensive bodies of text. This work proposes to utilize the Llama3.1 Instruct model to identify examples of resilient behavior within four categories on over 250,000 narratives from NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS). The analysis will reveal how similar and different resilient behaviors are present within various ASRS anomaly categories such as airborne conflict, near mid air collision, altitude deviation overshoot, runway excursion/incursions, and responses to external factors such as weather turbulence. Additionally, the analysis will compare resilient behavior between general aviation and commercial operation events as well as temporal trends within the archive of reports. The analysis aims to uncover how operators are practicing positive resilient behavior in situations described within the corpus of the report archive. This method provides a new lens into these valuable safety reports that can be used to inform and improve safety monitoring systems from this human resiliency perspective. The benefit can potentially lead to highlighting operator proficiencies across the aviation community and identifying knowledge gaps between different types of operations to ultimately improve safety within the NAS."

However, even with the use of wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductor devices, integrated motor drives still experience high voltage slew rates at the motor terminals. To mitigate this, dv/dt filters are implemented to reduce excessive voltage transients. This paper focuses on designing an analytically modelled optimized LRC-based dv/dt filter for a WBG devices-based inverter-fed integrated induction motor drive. A key challenge in filter design is the loading effect of motor impedance which leads to the dv/dt error (the deviation between the actual and target dv/dt). An algorithm is proposed to systematically design a dv/dt filter that effectively counteracts the impact of motor impedance loading. The proposed method is validated through a 2.2 kW, 415 V induction motor drive powered by a 650 V, 30 A GaN-based inverter (GS66508T)."

AFCSD continuously refines clusters to maintain relevance as data distributions shift, enabling more accurate anomaly detection in non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate that AFCSD outperforms batchmode clustering techniques in both adaptability and computational efficiency for streaming scenarios.

    "abstract": "Phishing is cybercrime that exploits digital platforms, and makes use of them to scam users into either sharing or stealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credentials and financial details etc., without their knowledge. It has become one of the greatest threats with increased reliance on mobile devices and digital services, making it a critical issue for individuals and organizations. Phishing attacks employ deceptive emails, URLs, and websites, taking advantage of user's trust to compromise security. Machine Learning and Deep Learning have proved to be efficient in phishing detection, discovering patterns based on URLs and activities of the site. Furthermore, they easily integrate into modern systems like filters in e-mail or browsers, which moves the fight against malware from reactive to proactive in real time, together with antivirus systems. This paper explores the combined strengths of them through a hybrid model to improve phishing detection. As a part of our work we explored a few Machine learning and Ensemble models and identified models like Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier have shown better results showcasing the ability to capture structured data patterns. In contrast, Deep learning models such as TabNet and LSTM outperformed other models as they learn complex, non-linear relationships, particularly in high-dimensional data with different features. Combining these approaches by stacking allows the hybrid model to leverage the complementary strengths of each approach to improve generalization and overall performance. The proposed hybrid model minimizes overfitting by adding the information of the insights of the Machine learning, Ensemble models and refining its predictions using the Deep learning models to achieve greater accuracy with balanced metrics while minimizing false positives. In this approach, our results were well balanced, having an accuracy of 97.97%, F1-score of 97.97%, recall of 98.05%, and a precision of 97.89%. The consistency of these values shows that the proposed model is stable. The minimum variation in the range of the metrics indicates a well balanced and stable model, with fewer false positives and false negatives demonstrating the potential for robust phishing detection."

    "abstract": "This work uses a tweaked MobileNetV2 model to provide an accurate and efficient deep learning method for guava leaf disease classification. Many fungal and bacterial illnesses that seriously affect crop output and quality might find their way on guava leaves. Effective care and prevention of many diseases depend on early detection of them. We thus used transfer learning to develop a strong classification model fit for agricultural diagnostics by fine-tuning the MobileNetV2 architecture, renowned for its lightweight and high-performance qualities. The model was trained on a carefully selected collection including three guava leaf disease class photos. Maintaining a regularly low loss, the model showed fast convergence across ten-training epochs, with a peak training accuracy of 98.97% and a validation accuracy of 99.48%. High classification dependability was shown by the classification report showing accuracy, recall, and F1-scores surpassing 0.97 for all classes. Showing low misclassifications and strong prediction confidence across all categories, the confusion matrix confirmed this even more. Visual study using accuracy and loss curves revealed the model's capacity to generalize effectively free from overfitting. These outcomes highlight how well MobileNetV2 extracts discriminative features even in settings with limited resources. Perfect for real-time agricultural uses, the suggested model guarantees computing efficiency in addition to great accuracy. This work opens the path for the creation of sophisticated agricultural monitoring systems, therefore supporting sustainable farming methods and precision agriculture. Expanding the dataset and implementing the model in mobile or edge-based systems for on-field usage will be main priorities of next development."

This work explores the possibilities and difficulties resulting from applying AI-driven DevOps techniques in quantum computing settings to improve serverless application performance in retail environments. By means of empirical analysis of hybrid quantum-classical deployment pipelines, we show that, under high availability for retail applications, AI-enhanced DevOps practices can attain up to 40% improvement in deployment efficiency and 35% reduction in quantum resource consumption. Important results show that combined with machine learning-based resource optimization, quantum-aware continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines greatly improve scalability and performance criteria. Evaluating three retail scenarios—dynamic pricing optimization, inventory management, and fraud detection—the research uses a mixed-methods approach combining controlled experiments with IBM Qiskit simulators and AWS Lambda serverless capabilities. Among all the scenarios, results show 51% deployment time reduction, 35% quantum resource optimization, and enhanced application performance. Challenges include, nevertheless, organizational skill gaps, hybrid system complexity, quantum decoherence management, and specialized toolchain needs. The paper offers a complete structure for companies trying to keep strong DevOps standards while using quantum computing benefits in retail serverless architectures.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of cloud storage and the increasing use of connected devices, uploading data to the cloud results in the loss of physical control by data owners, making confidentiality and integrity entirely dependent on Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). This raises concerns about whether CSPs effectively safeguard outsourced data, as any malicious behavior can lead to data tampering or deviation. Traditional auditing schemes rely on Third Party Authorities (TPAs), which are not always trustworthy. Although various cloud data auditing mechanisms have been proposed, few effectively address the challenge of ensuring data integrity without relying on trusted third parties. To overcome this limitation, we propose a secure and efficient distributed blockchain-based data integrity auditing scheme. Specifically, our approach randomly assigns the audit task to a user selected from among the system participants via blockchain. Blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) technologies are leveraged to enforce access control. Furthermore, the proposed scheme supports low-cost batch integrity verification without the need for a TPA. Theoretical analyses confirm that our solution ensures data traceability and auditability, and reduces reliance on third parties. Finally, our simulations show that proof generation remains under 0.7 seconds for 600 data blocks at 256-bit security, while verification costs remain negligible."

    "abstract": "Achieving high linearity and precise capacitive matching is a critical requirement in capacitive digital-to-analog converters (CDACs). To address this, the static and dynamic performance of a 10-bit, $833.33 \\mathrm{kS} / \\mathrm{s}$ low-power SAR ADC has been enhanced through the use of a split-decoded capacitive DAC architecture. The design is implemented using UMC 180 nm CMOS process technology and operates at a supply voltage of 1.8 V. A dual-path bootstrapped switch—comprising a main signal path and an auxiliary signal path—is employed to improve switching speed and linearity. Additionally, a triple-tail comparator is incorporated to achieve low noise and offset while maintaining low power consumption. Simulation results indicate that the proposed SAR ADC, featuring a split-decoded CDAC structure, consumes approximately $91.93 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$ of power. It demonstrates excellent static performance, achieving a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of 0.12 LSB and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of 0.14 LSB. In terms of dynamic behavior, the ADC attains a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 61.41 dB, a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 79.41 dB, and an effective number of bits (ENoB) of 9.91 bits for an input frequency of 813.802 Hz sampled at $833.33 \\mathrm{kS} / \\mathrm{s}$. Furthermore, corner analysis and Monte Carlo simulations are conducted, and the ADC’s dynamic performance is evaluated for various input frequencies around the Nyquist rate of 416.66 kHz."

The system enables patients to book appointments with their specific doctors by means of a friendly interface that displays available time slots and confirmation notifications. It also contains a more comprehensive billing system that sends automatic invoices to patients of various charges that they could download after discharge, leaving no room for billing-related ambiguity. Although the software project shows all the capabilities involved in managing a hospital operation, it lacks admin approval for account creation. It also does not encompass total patient management capabilities.

    "abstract": "This work aims to explore machine learning based vibration condition monitoring techniques for interturn fault detection in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs). Although previous studies mainly focus on pattern detection for faults using current signature analysis, this research shifts focus to the underexplored domain of vibration based fault detection using machine learning. In this paper, a hybrid approach is proposed that integrates statistical and frequency domain feature extraction with machine learning models for fault detection in PMSMs. Initially, key features including mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, and fast Fourier transform based features are extracted from time-domain vibration signals, which are sensitive to mechanical and electrical faults. Principal Component Analysis is used for dimension reduction and retaining the most important features. The resulting principal features are then utilized as inputs to machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbor, and deep learning classifiers such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Layer Perceptron for fault classification. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that KNN and Random Forest classifiers achieve the highest fault classification accuracy of approximately 95%, highlighting the robustness of the proposed methodology. The results suggest that the developed approach offers a reliable and efficient solution for real-time condition monitoring of PMSMs, with significant implications for electric transportation and sustainable energy applications."

To counter these, experts are improving Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, which rely on Feature Selection (FS) to identify key features and optimize performance in detecting attacks. In this context, this paper proposes a novel informed FS technique that exploits XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence). The proposed algorithm extends the use of Shapley Value in XAI by enhancing it with an accuracy-driven binary search with the aim of finding the most representative feature and therefore reducing the dimensionality of a Network Intrusion Dataset, improving its detection ability. Through a comprehensive experimental campaign, the proposal has been validated and its benefits, which are not only limited to reduced training and testing time, but also drastically streamlining the AI model complexity. Finally, a comparison with other standard FS techniques is also provided to further highlight the advantages of the proposed algorithm. The proposal has been validated through a comprehensive experimental campaign in which results show the benefits. The experimental section shows the performance of the model when trained on the set of features returned by DeepSHAP and on the set returned by our framework, showing a drastic reduction in training and testing time."

In contrast, our solution uses an independent linear filter for the kernel filter's adaptation, thus reducing the impact of the main linear filter. Additionally, to reduce adaptation complexity, we discard small coefficients of the linear acoustic path and apply a delay correction. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach successfully reduces complexity. With proper delay correction, our method yields performance improvements, including an approximately 7 dB improvement in System Distance (SD) compared to a purely linear filter and about <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{3 ~ d B}$</tex> improvement in Echo Return Loss Enhancement (ERLE) during saturation periods."

Unlike conventional approaches requiring multiple DC conversion stages, the proposed system implements parallel operation directly in the AC domain, reducing system complexity and conversion losses. The AP-VSG control incorporates real-time adaptation of virtual inertia (H) ranging from 1 s to 4 s and damping coefficient (D) from 20 to 65 pu, responding to grid frequency deviations and Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF). Implementation results demonstrate a 56% reduction in maximum RoCoF (from ±0.48 Hz/s to 0.21 Hz/s), a 33% improvement in frequency nadir, and a ±41% enhancement in damping ratio. The multi-objective optimization approach achieves a 36.7% reduction in control effort while maintaining stability margins (PM > 45°, GM > 6 dB). Statistical analysis confirms a 95th percentile frequency regulation enhancement of 43.5% compared to conventional VSG control.

The experiment is based on the actual power dispatching system data set and is compared with the traditional association algorithm in simulating multiple attack scenarios. The results show that the detection accuracy of the IGNN-DTA algorithm reaches 95.3%, the false alarm rate is as low as 3.1%, and the F1 value is 0.94. Compared with the traditional algorithm, the accuracy is improved by 12.7%, and the false alarm rate is reduced by 8.6%.

Conventional techniques for classifying bird species mostly rely on manual identification, which can be laborious, error-prone, and need a high level of skill. BirdSonic uses cuttingedge machine learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to examine bird call recordings in order to overcome these difficulties. The method facilitates accurate and efficient classification by converting these audio inputs into spectrogram images. Data gathering, preprocessing, spectrogram creation, model training, and an interactive interface for realtime species prediction are all steps that make up BirdSonic's core. Bird call datasets are gathered from both personal field recordings and open-source archives. These unprocessed audio files go through preprocessing, where data quality is guaranteed by segmentation and noise reduction methods. The CNN model uses the spectrogram image of sound frequencies that are created from the processed recordings. These spectrograms are used to train the deep learning model, which identifies unique audio patterns linked to various bird species. BirdSonic uses a number of data augmentation techniques, including time-shifting, pitch modulation, and background noise addition, to improve its accuracy to 93.34 % and resilience. Users can input audio recordings and get real-time bird species predictions using the final trained model, which is implemented in an interactive webbased interface."

    "abstract": "Smart meters play a crucial role in transferring information between customers and utility companies by utilizing bidirectional communication and introducing vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks, such as data replay attacks (DRA) and false data injection into databases, introduce errors in power demand load forecasting, which further results in energy supply scheduling problems. This paper provides a learning framework for smart meter cyber attacks by implementing a supervised machine learning algorithm to detect any kind of data anomalies or manipulation. The machine learning model employed in this paper includes Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. The fraudulent dataset is generated by employing two types of attack scenarios, and the performance of each machine-learning model is evaluated across diverse attack scenarios. In this proposed work, the percentage of attack level have been employed as 50%, 30%, 15%, and 5%. The performance metrics employed in this study to analyze the performance of the machine learning model are recall, precision, accuracy, f1-score, and area under the curve. The simulation results show that the attack level or imbalanced data proportion has a significant impact on the performance metrics of AdaBoost as the recall score has decreased from 0.9940 to 0.2608 if the attack level is decreased from 50% to 5%."

Notwithstanding developments in ensemble methods for medical diagnostics, problems such as class imbalance, high-dimensional data, and interpretability remain unresolved. This work suggests a methodical technique for diabetes prediction from a publicly available dataset. Robust data preprocessing (outlier removal, feature transformation, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for class imbalance), feature engineering, and hyperparameter optimization using GridSearch and Bayesian approaches form part of our approach. Stratified K-Fold ensures that the model can generalize better and reduce the chance of bias towards the more common class. With test accuracies of 97.18%, 97.21%, and 97.20%, respectively, assess and contrast three models: Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and XGBoost, where XGBoost has good predictive performance. While it excels in interpretable feature selection, our results show XGBoost beats DT and RF in accuracy, precision, and F1-score. This study compares modern ensemble methods for disease prediction and emphasizes the need for preprocessing and optimization in improving model generalization."

    "abstract": "Hardware security is an increasingly critical area in safeguarding power electronic converter systems from malicious attacks targeting control platforms. These systems rely heavily on embedded control units, such as microcontrollers, digital signal processors, field-programmable gate arrays, and programmable logic controllers, to implement intelligent control, complex communication protocols, and protection mechanisms in real-time applications. With rising concerns over cyber threats, particular attention is being given to the risks posed by hardware-based intrusions, commonly referred to as hardware Trojans. These malicious circuits can be stealthily introduced during various stages, including design, fabrication, firmware development, and system configuration. This article investigates the specific impact of hardware Trojans in the context of cascaded H-bridge multilevel converters, which are widely used in medium- and high-voltage applications. A systematic approach is presented to mathematically model different types of hardware Trojans, analyze their activation mechanisms, and assess their effects on system performance. Special emphasis is placed on how these intrusions can disrupt the intended operation of phase-shifted pulse width modulation strategy. The study aims to categorize hardware Trojans based on their behavior and effects, thereby laying a foundational benchmark for future research into the detection and mitigation of hardware-level threats in power electronic control platforms."

This paper presents a novel direct adaptive output feedback controller based on the internal model principle (IMP) to compensate for the unknown time-varying periodic disturbance in input delay systems. To reduce the design difficulty of the controller, the input delay system is equivalent to an input delay-free system by constructing stable auxiliary systems. Next, all the stabilizing controllers of the input delay system are derived by using the Youla parameterization method. Based on the IMP, an interpolation condition to completely compensate for periodic disturbances is formulated. Then, to compensate for the unknown time-varying periodic disturbance, a parameter adaptive algorithm is designed to update the Q-parameters online. The convergence of adaptive algorithms is analyzed by the Lyapunov function theory. Simulation and experimental results validated the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "In the field of aquaculture, the early and accurate identification of fish diseases definitely be the crucial point for disease prevention and control. However, there are several reasons: the complex underwater environment and the strong light scattering in water etc. This results in common quality degradation issues in acquired fish disease images, such as blurriness, low contrast, and indistinct features, which severely restricts the development of diagnostic technologies. Focusing on the above challenge, this paper proposes an innovative image generation algorithm that fuses the self-attention mechanism with the Cyclic Generative Adversarial Network (Cycle-GAN) to solve the part of problems. This algorithm is built on the architecture of the classic GAN, embedding a multi-scale convolutional attention module to enhance the model's ability to extract subtle features of fish diseases, bringing in a multi-scale feature fusion strategy to improve the sensitivity of the model to multi-dimensional information. By using the proposed algorithm to perform style transfer on real-time images of healthy fish, bidirectional conversion between healthy and diseased images is achieved, thereby constructing a mixed dataset to enhance to its quality. Experiments have shown that mixed dataset can significantly improve the recognition accuracy of subsequent classification models, providing reliable data support and technical paths for intelligent diagnosis of fish diseases, and has an important application value in disease prevention and control in aquaculture."

Although induction motors are popular owing to their reliability and cost advantages, they tend to use more energy than required, especially when running under light loads, which lowers the overall efficiency. To address this, this study explores smarter control methods such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Each method has its strengths;—PID handles precise error correction, FLC adapts to changing loads, and ANN predicts load shifts to adjust the motor behavior in real time. Together, they help reduce the starting current of motor, reduce energy losses, and boost overall performance across different conditions. Simulations using MATLAB/Simulink showed that these approaches, particularly an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) control strategy, significantly outperform traditional PID control by offering faster response times, better energy savings, and greater system stability. The results also highlight that rotor and stator core losses are greatly minimized, making the EV motor system more efficient and reliable."

The approach employs cross-modal attention for primary feature interaction and uses self-attention mechanisms to generate advanced features. A gating mechanism is introduced to dynamically adjust the fusion of features across different levels, followed by the use of a Transformer to capture deep inter-modal relationships. Experiments are conducted on two publicly available multimodal sentiment analysis datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, and the method in this paper achieves better performance compared to the baseline model."

The transformative machine learning solution that can help to solve this issue is the possibility to perform predictive analytics, real-time decision-making, and resource dynamics optimization. The proposed study proposes an intelligent optimization framework that utilizes both learning models that have supervision and those that are not with the use of which high-cost zones will be identified, as well as mismatched demand-supply situations and effective ways to achieve them will be recommended at the low costs. The way it works is that through the techniques such as reinforcement learning, deep neural networks and clustering algorithms, the system will learn itself per se and change settings based on the evolvement of trade patterns, geopolitical restrictions, and market shifts. It also unifies the real-time data feeds of IoT-connected nodes of logistics, to enhance better modelling accuracy and responsiveness. The use of these methodologies incurs major savings to the system in terms of operation cost, enhanced use of assets and a general increase of the efficiency of the logistics on a global basis. Simulations and comparative studies yielded significant results in saving costs and performance in delivering results relative to the traditional logistics optimization approaches. Compared to other algorithms, the proposed system achieved a maximum efficiency of 89.1% reduction in cost and rate of anomaly response of 93%."

The objective behind this is to achieve the National target of net zero carbon emissions by 2070. A rule-based energy management strategy (EMS) is developed to regulate the power distribution in the proposed PEMFC-LiB-ZaB-HES to meet the locomotive power demand while simultaneously satisfying the operating conditions of the energy sources. To validate the efficacy of the proposed HES, a performance comparison between the HES1, i.e., PEMFC-LiBZaB, and an existing HES2, i.e., PEMFC-LiB, is carried out using the real-time data of the ICPT of Himachal Pradesh.

Replay is the simplest method fraudsters use to deceive automatic speaker verification systems into accepting a fake speaker. The LPR signal conveys information about the excitation source, making it valuable for differentiating between spoofed and authentic speech samples. This work introduces a deep learning classifier called Linear Prediction Network (LPNet), which uses deep residual layers and takes LPR features as input. We explore various source features to evaluate the usefulness of LPR information in replay detection. The source features employed in this study include residual constant Q-cepstral coefficients(RCQCC), Residual mel-frequency cepstral coefficients(RMFCC), and residual phase constant Q cepstral coefficients(RPCQCC). These features serve as the front end for proposed models. Replay speech detection experiments were conducted using standard ASV spoof 2017 version2.0 database. With the LPNet classifier, the source features have provided $14.71 \\%, 21.03 \\%$, and 14.84% equal error rates (EERs), respectively. The score-level combinations of all three source features along with the popular CQCC feature achieved an 8.62% EER. The proposed combination outshines state-of-the-art replay detection techniques, thereby motivating readers to further explore in this direction."

    "abstract": "Human non-speech vocalization recognition and classification play a crucial role in emotional and health analysis, but they face significant challenges owing to data scarcity and noisy labels. Although ignoring noisy labels can improve model performance, it also reduces dataset size. To maximize utilization of all available audio data, we propose a self-improving, model-agnostic method based on an ensemble teacher-student framework. This approach leverages semi-supervised ensemble learning techniques to effectively guide student models in learning more features, while utilizing enhanced pseudo-labels derived from ensemble teacher models to significantly reduce the adverse effects of label noise and substantially enhance model performance. Additionally, integrating this method with data augmentation, weight averaging, transfer learning, and other complementary training strategies can further boost accuracy and overall effectiveness. Extensive experimental results on the VocalSound and other datasets confirm that the proposed method not only effectively mitigates label noise in audio datasets—leading to noticeable improvements in accuracy and stability—but also ensures strong generalization across various model architectures.

The designed antenna consists, from top to bottom, of a Circular Reconfigurable Metallic Wire (CRMW) layer, a parasitic patch layer, and a driven antenna multilayer board. By programming the FPGA to control the PIN diodes on the CRMW, the length distribution of the metallic segments can be changed, enabling beam reconfiguration. Additionally, the PIN diodes on the DC feeding network (DFN) allow for rapid switching among six polarization states. The effective overlapping operating frequency range for all beam states is 3.5 to 3.8 GHz. The radiation beam varies in two dimensions: with an azimuth range from 0 to 360° and an elevation range from -30° to +30°. The experimental results show excellent agreement with simulations for 18 different beam states. Furthermore, the antenna achieves an average peak gain of 7.1 dBi, with a total efficiency exceeding 55.9% across all reconfigurable states. The antenna has potential applications in multifunctional integrated systems for drone communications and anti-jamming systems."

Currently, high spatial resolution SSM estimation primarily relies on machine learning methods. However, in heterogeneous environments, the challenges associated with hyperparameter optimization, computational efficiency and uncertainty control compromise the robustness of these methods. To address this issue, this study introduces and evaluates an integrated strategy that combines Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimization (GP-BO) with machine learning for high-resolution SSM retrieval. The results demonstrate that the combined method significantly outperforms conventional optimization methods evaluated by the test sets from Heihe River Basin, Naqu, and Shandian River basins. Notably, the integration of GP-BO with XGBoost turned out to be the optimal combination, improving R² by 0.01–0.19 and reducing ubRMSE by 0.02–1.71 percentage points relative to conventional optimizers, while requiring the least training time for ensemble models. Furthermore, vegetation-specific GP-BO-tuned XGBoost models achieve varying degrees of accuracy improvement and reduced uncertainty across various vegetation, particularly in barren and grassland regions. These findings highlight the effectiveness of GP-BO hyperparameter optimization algorithm in reducing the uncertainties of SSM estimation in heterogeneous environments."

    "abstract": "The core to tackle clothes changed person re-identification is to extract clothes-irrelevant features. Previous methods typically decoupled the entire image features into clothes-relevant and ID-relevant ones via an auxiliary task of clothes classification, yet in this way, it is not guaranteed that the ID-relevant features fully get rid of clothes-relevant information, as the entire image feature also includes other information, such as posture. To enhance the purity of ID-relevant features, this letter proposes a simple yet effective siamese feature decoupling and adaptive prototype alignment framework (Decoupling and Alignment, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D&amp;A</i>), which involves a reference branch and an alignment branch. Specifically, the reference branch first uses human parsing to remove clothes information at the image level to ensure that the ID prototype subsequently extracted by the image encoder is purely ID-relevant without clothes; the alignment branch excludes clothes information from the ID-relevant features by dual-token decoupling, and then aligns the ID-relevant features with the ID prototypes in the reference branch to enhance the purity of the identity information obtained after decoupling. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive update strategy to update the ID prototypes to prevent the ID prototypes and the decoupled features from shifting in feature space. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks (PRCC, LTCC, and VC-Clothes) validate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves new state-of-the-art results across most metrics."

    "abstract": "Precision orthodontics relies heavily on timely precision measurement during an orthodontic treatment. However, the measurement done by orthodontists currently (i.e., calipers) cannot provide a fast and precise measurement. The study introduces a novel real-time automatic image-based system for precision tooth measurement, characterized by its high accuracy and efficiency. The video input of the dentures from a head-mounted camera was taken one frame at a time. Since 70% of orthodontal treatment is done using fixed brackets, we used an object detection algorithm to locate the position of the brackets within the frame. A novel multi-object tracking algorithm was developed to track and update the positions based on the long short-time memory information collected on the previous frames. A measurement module then measures and updates the distance between each bracket and saves it making sure the measurements are available even when the bracket is not visible in the current frame. The real-time tracking and measurement improved the efficiency and accuracy of tooth measurement. In clinical cases, the teeth were recognized with 97% accuracy and tracked without any loss within a video input of 60 FPS. This measurement achieves a resolution on the order of 0.01 mm, with a data error less than 50 μm. This real-time automatic tooth measurement proved to be efficient and easy to use compared to existing methods while improving accuracy. It can be used in aiding precision orthodontics and in the process of automating dental treatments."

    "abstract": "This work improves a previously proposed quantification framework by expanding its applicability to quaternary odor mixtures and optimizing the active-sensing process. The approach employs four quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors, where both frequency shifts and resistance changes at multiple odd harmonics—measured by vector network analyzers (VNWA)—serve as virtual sensors to enhance selectivity. A selection strategy based on the condition number was introduced to identify informative harmonic responses. Experiments validated that the proposed method reduced the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 47.44%, with a statistically significant improvement (p = 0.0070) compared with the only fundamental responses. Among three feedback control algorithms, finite horizon linear–quadratic regulator (LQR) with time-varying gains achieved the best active-sensing performance. The experimental evaluations further confirmed short-term and long-term repeatabilities, as well as the capability to handle unstable sensor responses. Overall, the proposed method enables accurate and robust quantification of quaternary odor mixtures across a wide recipe range, demonstrating its potential as an easy-to-use solution for future odor recording systems."

To realize this, user-specific masking and attention-driven decoding are employed over a shared embedding space, which is mathematically modeled to characterize attention-based IA in the embedding domain and to enable implicit user separation without explicit orthogonalization. Built on a conventional cross-entropy (CE) loss, the proposed orthogonalization regularization further reinforces interference alignment by aligning user-specific semantic subspaces and suppressing inter-user interference. Experiments under Rayleigh fading channels show that the proposed approach outperforms both a resource-partitioned baseline with separate embeddings and a CE-only loss model without orthogonalization regularization, showing the effectiveness of an attention-driven IA solution for multi-user semantic communication."

In this article, built on proportional–integral (PI) theory, an adaptive neural network (ANN) PI iterative learning tracking control method for fractional-order nonlinear systems (FONSs) with full-state constraints is presented. A new type of BLF is built that only requires finding a derivative of this function needs to be monotonic under the fractional Lyapunov direct method. To meet the needs of reducing computational complexity and data volume, the designed backstepping controller based on PI control consists of a series of constant gains and dynamic variables with basic linkage relationships. Moreover, it also incorporates iterative learning algorithm that can achieve continuous or discontinuous self-learning and updating. The results indicate that all closed-loop signals of FONSs are semi-globally ultimately uniformly bounded and the constraint is not violated. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation have verified the rationality of this study."

This study conducted accelerated irradiation experiments on thyristors using non-destructive SEB methodology. Substantial statistical samples confirm that the time intervals of non-destructive SEB events follow a Weibull distribution with shape parameters close to 1, indicating the protective SEB is still primarily driven by random neutron collision events. Additionally, the degradation of thyristor material was found to have no significant influence on the failure-rate-voltage relationship. These findings collectively validate the feasibility of substituting non-destructive SEB testing for destructive methods. Furthermore, the mathematical failure-rate-voltage model was validated through two independent high-altitude experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first mutual validation between accelerated testing and authentic high-altitude conditions. The findings of this study provide a valuable reference for the lifespan prediction of thyristors and the construction of high-voltage direct current converter stations in high-altitude environments."

    "abstract": "The hybrid DC circuit breaker (HCB) is crucial for clearing faults and ensuring a reliable power supply in DC grids. However, the fault current can rise rapidly in the low-voltage DC systems, and existing traditional HCB solutions cannot meet the demands of speed and size due to the structure design of the fast mechanical switch and additional assisted commutation devices. In this letter, a novel arc-enhanced lightweight ultra-fast mechanical switch is proposed for low-voltage HCBs. Compared to traditional fast mechanical switches designed for HCBs, the proposed ultrafast mechanical switch offers an extremely fast inherent opening time and current interruption time by eliminating the unnecessary arc extinguishing chamber and applying an innovative dual-stage motion design. Meanwhile, the structure of double-point contact enhances the arc voltage, enabling faster current commutation to the power electronic switch without any bulky auxiliary device. After parameter design and optimization, a compact 750 V HCB prototype based on the novel ultra-fast mechanical switch is built to verify the feasibility. The prototype has an inherent opening time of 70 μs and can interrupt a 26 kA current within 400 μs."

The progression towards multimodal computational methods in sarcasm detection, however, faces challenges due to the scarcity of data. To address this, we present AMuSeD (Attentive deep neural network for MUltimodal Sarcasm dEtection incorporating bi-modal Data augmentation). This approach utilizes the Multimodal Sarcasm Detection Dataset (MUStARD) and introduces a two-phase bimodal data augmentation strategy. The first phase involves generating varied text samples through Back-Translation from several secondary languages. The second phase involves the refinement of a FastSpeech2-based speech synthesis system, tailored specifically for sarcasm to retain sarcastic intonations. Alongside a cloud-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) service, this Fine-tuned FastSpeech2 system produces corresponding audio for the text augmentations. We also evaluate various attention mechanisms for selectively enhancing sarcasm-relevant features, finding self-attention to be the most efficient. Our experiments reveal that the proposed approach achieves a significant F1-score of 81.0% in text-audio modalities, surpassing even models that use three modalities from the MUStARD dataset."

Therefore, object detection for nearby entities (e.g., front-view vehicle images) becomes critically important. However, the stability and accuracy of current mainstream object detection algorithms still require improvement. To address this issue, this study deploys two industry-standard models in driving scenarios: the one-stage network YOLOv8 and the lightweight model YOLOv5, aiming to evaluate their robustness and generalization capabilities under varying instance quantity distributions. Furthermore, a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is integrated into YOLOv8m to enhance detection accuracy and recall rates in complex environments. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8 outperforms YOLOv5 with varying degrees of improvement across different training instance quantities while exhibiting enhanced generalization capabilities. The BiFPN-enhanced YOLOv8m achieves approximately 13% higher accuracy than standard YOLOv8m, though it imposes stricter requirements on training sample quantity and distribution characteristics."

    "abstract": "Water scarcity and inefficient irrigation methods continue to be pressing challenges in modern agriculture, particularly in regions with highly variable climates. Traditional systems often irrigate based on fixed schedules, without accounting for real-time soil moisture or weather conditions, resulting in significant water wastage. This paper addresses this gap by developing a real-time, sensor-based smart irrigation system utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with ambient sensors, including soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainfall detectors. Based on field data, a rule-based decision model controls a water pump via a relay and concurrently transmits the sensor readings to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for monitoring and visualization. Experimental evaluations under varied simulated environmental conditions demonstrate that the system effectively conserves water by avoiding irrigation during rainfall or when the soil moisture is adequate. The proposed approach offers a low-cost, scalable, and minimally supervised solution for sustainable agriculture in water-stressed regions."

This research involves advanced forecasting techniques for major Indian cities such as Mumbai and Chennai.

This study proposed a variable-weighted ensemble model with Gradient COA to forecast the AQI of different cities. Additionally, five state-of-the-art swarm and evolutionary algorithms are studied to determine the ensemble forecasts. The individual forecasts of individual models are optimized using the GCOA model by determining the best weights for each model. Different accuracy matrices are considered to determine the accuracy of the models. The simulation results suggest that the proposed variable-weighted ensembled model with GCOA provides a statistically better deterministic forecast than other individual models and ensemble models for Mumbai and Chennai AQI time series data, with RMSE values of 8.6269 and 20.6198, respectively."

Unlike conventional inverters, which face limitations such as restricted voltage boost capabilities and inefficiencies in handling variable DC inputs, the ZSI offers a robust solution by integrating an impedance network between the DC supply and the inverter's six-switch configuration. This unique topology enables the ZSI to overcome the drawbacks of traditional inverters, particularly in applications requiring voltage enhancement. The impedance network serves as an intermediate stage, allowing the inverter to efficiently boost the DC input voltage, making it highly suitable for renewable energy systems like solar PV. ZSI’s ability to handle wide variations in input voltage and its enhanced reliability under fluctuating conditions make it an attractive choice for integrating unconventional energy sources into the grid. This study focuses on the design and operational principles of the ZSI, emphasizing its advantages in solar PV systems, where maintaining stable and efficient power conversion is critical. The key contributions of this work are: (i) the formulation of a detailed design methodology for a three-phase ZSI specifically adapted for solar PV integration, (ii) analysis of the inverter's performance under variable irradiation conditions to ensure stability and efficiency, and (iii) validation of the proposed design through simulation results demonstrating improved voltage boosting capability and reliability over traditional inverter systems. These findings establish ZSI as a versatile and efficient solution for modern renewable energy applications."

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, exceptional progress has been made in deep learning and its applications to medical imaging including image analysis, disease classification, medical image segmentation, and a variety of other tasks. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive cognitive disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the world. In this research, we present a lightweight hybrid classical-quantum framework leveraging quantum machine learning (QML) using the pennylane library. Consisting of classical convolutional neural network (CNN) and quantum circuits as quantum nodes wrapped in a torch layer of pytorch, the framework has a total of eight layers including the quantum layer, for the classification of Alzheimer’s disease stages from brain MRI images. Using this framework, the 4 -class Alzheimer’s MRI dataset is assessed. This dataset contains 6400 MRI images across four classes of disease stages, available in the Kaggle. The dataset has gone through the Pre-processing stage of augmentation to scale and balance the classes. The proposed hybrid framework achieves an accuracy of 96.26 % in classifying 4 stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, outperforming the classical deep learning models while utilizing substantially fewer parameters. The superior performance of the hybrid framework is compared with the performance of four other classical models: 1. VGG 2. Densenet 3. Enet and 4. Resnet. Grad-CAM (Explainable AI) is employed to assess the proposed framework’s focus on relevant brain regions and to validate its accuracy through consultation with a medical professional. By ensuring alignment between the framework’s attention and clinical expertise, this research enhances the potential for assisting medical professionals in accurately interpreting neurodegenerative disease states and thereby advancing the development of clinically applicable diagnostic tools. It also demonstrates the feasibility of adopting quantum machine learning in medical image analysis and medical AI."

Initially, the mathematical mechanism underlying the ambiguity problem inherent in current trajectory alignment methods is analyzed, and the mathematical derivation for ICPbased trajectory alignment is presented. Subsequently, an implementation approach for ICP-based trajectory alignment is introduced to mitigate the strong dependence on initial trajectory and the high computational complexity associated with the Umeyama algorithm.

We started by using the Ziegler-Nichols and Cohen-Coon approaches to determine the ideal PID parameters. We then used extensive MATLAB simulations and experimental validation to assess performance. According to our research, the Smith Predictor mechanism significantly reduces key performance indicators such as overshoot percentage, settling time, and error indices (more especially, IAE and ISE values). When compared to traditional methods, this combination provides better system responsiveness and stability. The outcomes demonstrate how well Smith Predictor mitigates the effects of time delays, making it a useful addition to PID control systems for industrial liquid level applications for management."

    "abstract": "The recent years have witnessed the advancement of smart security mechanisms significantly improving the strength of detection and response to cyber attacks in different network environments, particularly in software-defined networking (SDN). Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to pose a serious threat to such programmable networks. The present paper is a systematic review of recent trends of utilization of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods in detection of DDoS attacks in SDN-based systems. Extensive literature search was undertaken, and papers between the years 2018 and November 2022 were taken into consideration. Academic journals and online archives like IEEE, ACM, Springer, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant research studies. The results are compiled into five broad categories: (i) classification of methods of DDoS detection by ML and DL; (ii) comparison of algorithms based on methodology, strength, and limitations; (iii) identification of benchmark datasets and attacks employed; (iv) comparison of means of data preprocessing, parameterization, test setup, and assessment measures; and ($\\mathbf{v}$) identification of limitations of the existing work and areas of scope for innovation. The review also briefly comments on the real-world applicability of these models, their high-traffic network scalability, and the necessity for real-time detection capability. The paper aims to guide future work towards more efficient, adaptive, and scalable mechanisms of DDoS detection in SDN, and stimulate towards hybrid framework development as well as the use of newer datasets towards improved generalizability and strength."

    "abstract": "Environmental conditions always effect the Photovoltaic Power Generation (PPG). Shading on solar panel is a major issue and also creates multiple peaks in the P-V characteristics. Therefore, metaheuristics algorithm based controllers are introduced to track the Global Peak Power (GPP) among the multiple peaks. Among the metaheuristics algorithms Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is widely recommended, but the global best solutions depends on number of particles, inertia weight, cognitive and social agents. Proportionally, it is well know that the irradiance, temperature and shading percentage on the solar panels changes simultaneously as well as dynamically. Therefore, there is a necessity to tune the parameters of PSO as per the operating conditions. Hence, this paper presents a novel Hybrid GPP Tracking (HGPPT) algorithm based on PSO and Support Vector Machines (PSOSVM). Simulation results benchmark the superiority of the proposed HGPPT scheme over PSO."

    "abstract": "The conventional radial distribution network is complicated and hard to control the electricity flow. However, the system must be controlled so that the quality of electricity remains within the required limit. This paper presents a way to devise and implement a distributed generation (DG) optimization way for reducing power distribution losses. The main objective of the algorithm lies with the finest size and position of the DG units within the network for dropping power losses while confirming voltage stability. Thus, the proposed algorithm actually uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to govern its precise size and location. It also takes other constraints into account such as branch currents, voltage stability limits, and power balancing formulae. The PSO algorithm changes particle positions and velocities interactively in order to determine optimum search space values to reach the best solution. It again discusses data pre-treatment, network modeling, implementation of the PSO algorithm, and results analysis. Most importantly, it utilizes the MATLAB language to develop and implement algorithms. The simulations show that the suggested strategy can efficiently minimize power losses while improving voltage profiles when compared with the base case situation in the absence of DG integration. This work advances optimization strategies for integrated DG distribution in power distribution systems, which could be of utmost importance in reality for power grid management and planning."

First, multiple UAVs equipped with optical sensors are utilized to rapidly construct a 3D base map of the scene through technologies such as point cloud reconstruction, structure from motion (SfM), and multi-view stereo (MVS). Second, the YOLOv5 model is improved to enhance the detection accuracy of dynamic targets, and the DeepSort algorithm is integrated to achieve real-time multi-target tracking. Furthermore, based on the principle of multi-view geometry, the precise 3D coordinate estimation and projection visualization of targets in the reconstructed scene are realized by fusing camera poses and 3D point cloud information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reconstruct complex urban scenes and localize dynamic targets in real time, providing reliable support for situational awareness."

First, a unified representation system of power user electricity consumption records, environmental variables and user attribute data is systematically constructed, and a feature extraction module based on GRU and CNN is designed. The Transformer attention mechanism is used to fuse the information of each modality to generate a shared feature space to achieve accurate classification of user behavior. The experimental part selects real smart meter data in 2023 for verification. The fused model is superior to the single modal and traditional classification algorithm in key indicators such as F1 value and AUC. The ablation experiment further proves the core role of multi-source fusion in improving the model's expression ability and behavior recognition accuracy. The research results show that this method has good engineering adaptability and promotion prospects in smart grids, and can provide effective data support for power optimization, load forecasting and demand response strategies."

In particular, heat generation and transfer through these components can significantly affect the overall pack temperature distribution and operational safety. This study presents a transient electrothermal modeling and simulation analysis of cylindrical lithium-ion battery modules, evaluating thermal behavior both with and without the inclusion of busbars and electrical contact resistance effects. Results indicate that neglecting these components leads to a substantial underestimation of temperature gradients, with differences of approximately 10°C at a 1C discharge rate and 20°C at a 2C discharge rate for a 15s15p battery pack configuration. Furthermore, the influence of busbar materials and geometric parameters was investigated, and optimized configurations were identified to minimize temperature disparities. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating auxiliary component heat generation in battery pack thermal management and design optimization for electric vehicle applications."

Initially designed as independent backup systems, these distributed generators are now being synchronized with the grid and increasingly utilized as primary electricity sources. This transition, driven by advancements in renewable and non-conventional energy technologies, is accelerating the development and widespread adoption of Microgrids, reshaping the future of power systems. Furthermore, interconnecting multiple Microgrids offers significant benefits, such as optimizing surplus renewable energy by transferring it to neighboring Microgrids, thereby reducing reliance on energy storage systems and enhancing the overall stability and efficiency of power distribution. In this paper, the Graph-Based Optimization Modelling Language (GBOML) is employed to optimize the overall installation cost of renewable energy technologies. The results obtained from GBOML are compared with Pyomo to evaluate the effectiveness of GBOML. For the purposes of this study, the load data, as well as solar and wind energy data, were collected for four distinct regions in India: Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and West Bengal.

To overcome this limitation, a digital adaptive control technique is proposed to detect FDI attacks and ensure stable frequency regulation. The FDI attack detection is done using the digital twin, a real time virtual model of the power grids.

The Adam optimizer (learning rate: 0.001; batch size: 64) is used to train the model over 100 epochs. The benchmark Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, which includes both single and compound fault conditions, is used to assess it. Following convolutional, involuted, and LSTM layers for deep feature extraction and temporal modeling, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) improves noise resilience in the preprocessing stage. The model reaches classification accuracies ranging from 98–100% across six fault classes, including compound types. The inference latency and power can be reduced to 12.6 ms and under 4.3 W respectively when implemented on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC which shows that it is applicable as a real time embedded application. Although the results on standard datasets are encouraging, it will need to be confirmed in further work that robustness extends to industrial environments with robust noise on a non-stationary dataset."

However, achieving high classification accuracy across diverse subjects and the class imbalance between sparse target and abundant non-target are challenging issues due to inter-subject variability and the complex spatiotemporal nature of EEG signals. In this study, we propose a novel approach by combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and a multi-band deep learning architecture to address the issue of class imbalance between target and non-target EEG events in RSVP paradigms. The preprocessing involves ‘multi-band’ filtering, dimensionality reduction, and class-specific augmentation using GANs trained on different frequency bands. The deep learning model consists of band-specific convolutional and LSTM layers along with an attention mechanism for spatiotemporal feature fusion. The evaluation is done on the basis of multiple key performance metrics including accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, ROC-AUC and unweighted average recall (UAR). The results demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning architectures in decoding RSVP based EEG signals, offering a robust framework for real-time BCIs with reduced calibration demands.

    "abstract": "Real-world photography often suffers from inadequate lighting due to both the technical limitations of camera systems and uncontrollable external conditions. Low-light image enhancement algorithms improve the quality of images acquired in poor lighting conditions. Further, enhancing these images is crucial for improving performance in vision tasks such as object detection and image recognition. However, different image degradations, such as noise and bias, are unavoidable even in the enhanced images. To tackle them, the Retinexformer low-light image enhancement method integrates the principles of Retinex theory and the transformer model. In this paper, we present a variant of the Retinexformer model that includes an additional edge-guided parallel network to improve performance. Our method employs a dual-path corruption restoration framework to ensure better preservation of edge detail. To validate the approach, we conducted experiments using the LOL dataset, and the results were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively."

Recently, the vision-language model CLIP has shown strong performance in ZSAD due to its cross-modal alignment and generalization ability. However, CLIP is designed for natural image classification, relying on global semantics while being insensitive to local details. Its static text-image fusion also limits the use of textual prompts, reducing performance on small-scale, complex-texture, or weakly semantic anomalies. To address this, we propose LACLIP, an enhanced vision-language anomaly detection framework. We incorporate Local Self-Correlation Attention (LSC-Attention) to improve local context modeling and introduce an Anomaly Semantic Aggregation (ASA) module to guide text-image matching with more discriminative semantics. Experiments show that LACLIP achieves state-of-the-art results on MVTec AD and VisA for both image-level classification and pixel-level localization, highlighting its potential for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Construction fence is an important facility to ensure the safety of construction and pedestrians, and detection errors will cause great safety hazards. Therefore, it is very important to study a method for detecting construction fences. However, due to the complexity of the construction site, the large number of similar construction objects and the occlusion problem, as well as the problems of different sizes in different scenes, the existing object detection model of the fence often performs poorly in the complex scene of construction. In this paper, we propose an improved object detection method based on YOLOv8, namely BiFNCA-YOLOv8. In order to reduce the scale and complexity of the model, improve the ability to extract the main features, and improve the accuracy, the traditional convolution and FPN are replaced with Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network to reduce the size and complexity of the model, and improve the accuracy without increasing the structural complexity and computational complexity. Then, Convolutional Block Attention Module is added to the fusion node to improve the fine-grained and detection accuracy of the model through the spatial attention mechanism. Compared with YOLOv8s, our BiFNCA-YOLOv8 improves the F1 score and mAP by 8.8 and 11.1, respectively, and the accuracy is increased to 93.7%, indicating that the bidirectional feature pyramid network and the convolutional attention module can effectively enhance the robustness of construction fence detection under real industrial conditions."

Focusing on a pilot project in the Jind–Sonipat railway section, the study assesses the economic feasibility and environmental impact of hydrogen-powered trains. A comparative cost analysis reveals that while hydrogen trains involve higher initial capital investment, their operational costs-estimated at ₹164.5 per 1000 passenger-km, are competitive, falling between diesel (₹79.78) and electric trains (₹256.2). Integrating hydrogen fuel cells with renewable energy sources offers significant emissions reductions and supports India's transition toward a low-carbon transport sector. However, large-scale adoption will require further research to address safety concerns related to hydrogen storage and refuelling and operational challenges arising from India's varied climate and topography. With continued technological progress and supportive policy frameworks, hydrogen propulsion presents a promising pathway for cleaner, more sustainable rail transport in India."

A large database is created based on the infrared image of artificially contaminated insulator samples captured at different environmental conditions. The infrared images were initially processed through a mask region- based convolutional neural network to mitigate the background effect. The infrared images corresponding to different contamination were fed to a benchmark convolutional neural network (CNN) model (Alex Net) for classification purposes. Transfer learning with a fine-tuning strategy was adopted to train the network. The result indicates that the proposed approach returns appreciably high classification performance with reduced computational time compared to existing techniques.

However, conventional iterative inversion methods based on physical equations exhibit low computational efficiency, which to some extent limits the real-time geological steering capability of LWD logging. This paper proposes a neural network-based inversion method for LWD electromagnetic resistivity logging data. This method employs a shared neural network (Shared Net) composed of two linear layers and activation functions to predict stratigraphic resistivity intervals. Two output layers (Lower and Upper) are configured to output the upper and lower bounds of the predicted interval, respectively. During training, the quantile loss function is set to 0.05 and 0.95 to achieve a 90% confidence interval, while a width penalty term is added to prevent excessively wide intervals. The method demonstrated high accuracy in testing, achieving an average accuracy rate of 97%. Single-point prediction time is less than 0.1 seconds, enabling rapid and precise inversion of formation resistivity information. This provides a more effective method for real-time inversion of resistivity data acquired during drilling."

In some cases, cancer spreads to the brain from other parts of the body. This paper presents, a hybrid model that combines Vision Transformers(ViT) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) for brain tumor detection. This fused approach predicts whether a person has a brain tumor and also classifies the type of tumor (Glioma, Meningioma, or Pituitary). Initially, we implemented a GCN model on our dataset, where features were extracted using the traditional Histogram method. However, this approach achieved an accuracy of only 66.96%, indicating poor performance of the model. This low accuracy is due to that the Histogram captures only pixel intensity distribution and lose important shape and texture information. To address this issue, we replaced the Histogram method with ResNET-18. a pretrained deep learning model. This change significantly improved the accuracy of the model to 94.04% as ResNET-18 effectively extracts local features. ResNET-18 extracts local features and less stable for large datasets.

Inspired by the biological principle of neural-based navigation in animals, a multi-objective optimization model based on the width neural network and Nash equilibrium strategy (N-WNN) is proposed to improve the reachability and flexibility of path planning. Specifically, the width neural network (WNN) is expanded to intensify feature extraction within hidden layers, without increasing network depth, thereby capturing crucial path information. Nash equilibrium strategy helps realize multi-objective optimization of path planning by making each objective in path planning reach an equilibrium state under the condition of mutual influence and restriction, so that each objective cannot be further optimized by unilaterally changing the strategy given by other objective strategies, thus helping to realize multi-objective optimization of path planning. Through experimental verification of path planning problems in different scenarios, the results show that the proposed method has significant advantages in multi-objective optimization, which can effectively balance the reachability and flexibility of path planning, and has been compared in detail with the two most advanced multi-objective optimization algorithms currently available, proving the superiority of the proposed algorithm."

The goal is to validate a bit error rate model under practical OFDM transmission scenarios involving multiple access points communicating with user equipment. We highlight how time misalignment between LoS paths can degrade system performance and evaluate the effectiveness of various compensation strategies under such conditions. A key contribution of this work is the proposed compensation technique for LoS path misalignment. By applying a frequency-dependent linear phase shift to each subcarrier—an operation that is both low in complexity and easy to implement—we induce a circular rotation of the OFDM time-domain symbol. This rotation effectively aligns the various LoS contributions in time, as long as the path delays remain within the cyclic prefix duration. Notably, the method is fully compatible with analog beamforming architectures, which are essential in mmWave systems to reduce the number of costly RF chains. As a result, the proposed strategy enables efficient time compensation with minimal computational and hardware overhead, making it particularly attractive for distributed Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) deployments at mmWave frequencies."

The main challenge of installing the PMUs at different parts of the power grid is its installation cost. Thus, researchers have proposed various optimal PMU placement solutions. The data generated by PMUs needs to be transferred to phasor data concentrators (PDCs). However, the cost of installation of communication links is higher than the cost of PMUs. Thus, in the present work, a new binary parrot optimization (PO) technique has been proposed to solve the simultaneous placement of optimal PMU and optimal PDC locations for WAMS. The proposed technique is then tested and validated by applying to IEEE 14- and IEEE 30-bus systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in providing better solutions compared with the existing method, that reduces the number of PDCs and lower communication expenses while preserving both system observability and communication effectiveness."

    "abstract": "The rising demand for energy, depletion of fossil fuel reserves, and increasing environmental concerns, has led to the adoption of renewable energy sources. To integrate these sources into conventional power systems some structural modifications are necessary to ensure seamless operation. This study presents a small wind turbine (SWT) system, connected to a utility grid. The main objective is to develop a 12.3 kW wind energy system that can supply power to three phase loads. The proposed system comprises a three-phase diode rectifier, a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based small wind turbine, a boost converter, bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDC), DC-link capacitor selection, and a utility grid. To optimize power output and regulate voltage, the Black Widow Optimization (BWO) algorithm is employed for maximum power extraction from the boost converter. Additionally, a BWO-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is implemented to ensure rapid MPPT convergence and maintain voltage stability despite wind speed variations. A mixed-order PLL is used for grid synchronization. The performance of the proposed system is validated under constant and sudden wind speed variation conditions."

    "abstract": "High reliability and scalability are two of the key requirements for cloud-native applications. However, these can be efficiently managed only if proper traffic flow among the services is possible. This work demonstrates the use of a Network Load Balancer (NLB) using Docker and Kubernetes technologies along with how the NLB will distribute the traffic to the containerized application deployed within the pod of Kubernetes. Docker allows developers to package an application along with all of its dependencies so that it works correctly across various environments, making it seamless. That is complemented by Kubernetes, which takes responsibility for the creation, scaling, and management of containers using components like pods, deployments, and services. Our programs ensured that the incoming traffic of such pods is distributed evenly so that at least one instance doesn't work as a bottleneck and affect performance. This enables routing requests from an external NLB to appropriate pods. Such an approach in building applications helps in scalability, provides automatic failover in case of pod failures, and uses load- balancing algorithms such as round-robin, least connections, or IP hash. The results show that increasing the number of pods lead to reduced error rate. The offering also supports dynamic provisioning of load balancers by integrating itself with the cloud platform; thus, it allows applications to cope up with varying traffic levels with little human interference. The advantages of such a network load balancing is its use in microservices architecture, showing how it reduces scaling issues, improve reliability, and improve traffic management in a distributed system or cloud."

    "abstract": "Action recognition in videos is a crucial task in computer vision with applications ranging from surveillance to interactive media, yet traditional methods have struggled to fully capture the complex temporal dynamics involved. Existing models often fail to effectively integrate spatial and temporal information, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios where action contexts vary significantly. Conventional approaches primarily utilize either convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which may not adequately handle long-term dependencies or require extensive computation. This paper introduces ST-GateNet, a dual-stream Transformer-CNN architecture that employs a gated fusion mechanism for dynamic integration of spatial and temporal features. The Transformer stream uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) with 12 layers and 768-dimensional embeddings for temporal encoding, while the CNN stream utilizes a 3D ResNet-50 for robust spatial feature extraction. The effectiveness of STGateNet is demonstrated on two benchmark datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51, which include diverse human actions captured in varied settings. ST-GateNet achieves an accuracy of 98.3% on UCF101 and 76.5 % on HMDB51, significantly outperforming existing models like TimeSformer and SlowFast Networks in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed ST-GateNet model significantly enhances action recognition performance by effectively synthesizing spatial and temporal data, proving to be a robust solution for real-time video analysis."

Synthetic log datasets were generated to mimic real-world formats, with various injected anomalies such as unauthorized access patterns, spikes, and missing entries. A dynamic thresholding mechanism based on statistical methods, including the interquartile range (IQR), was used to enhance the detection accuracy. Extensive simulations demonstrated that the proposed model achieves an F1-score of 0.908 and an AUC of 0.963 while maintaining low latency, indicating its potential for real-time deployment in large-scale systems.

The implemented model provides the classification accuracy of 97.12%. The resource utilization of the FFANN implementation across all the considered FPGAs was examined, which revealed that the requirements for flip-flops and look-up tables changes among the FPGAs. However, all FPGAs under consideration requires equal numbers of Block RAM (BRAM), input/output (IO) pins, global clock buffers (BUFG), and digital signal processing (DSP) units. The performance analysis shows that the FFANN implementation on the Kintex-7 FPGA achieved the best performance, surpassing the lowest-performing Artix-7 low voltage FPGA by 81.84%. In terms of power consumption, FFANN is most power-efficient on Kintex-7 low voltage FPGA, with a total power consumption of 9.566 watts."

With respect to previously developed solutions, the proposed strategy determines the locations of the radar sensors considering not only the terrain topology and the sensor characteristics but also the mutual radar interference arising when different radars field of regard overlap. Results of the optimization algorithm in identifying optimal locations for the sensors are assessed by checking the main performance parameters (i.e., network coverage, Cramer-Rao Bound and probability of detection) in the whole environment. The strategy is validated using two real world scenarios and demonstrates that the optimized radar network is able to fulfill the required surveillance performance, while minimizing the radar mutual interference."

The transition towards electric aircraft requires higher bus voltages to meet increasing power demands. As bus voltages rise, high-voltage semiconductors become essential for propulsion, making traditional two-level converters unsuitable due to higher dv/dt, larger filter requirements, and increased switching losses. To address these challenges, neutral-point-clamped multilevel converters have been widely studied in the literature. However, ensuring fault-tolerant operation is critical for propulsion system reliability in electric aircraft. In light of this, this paper proposes a fault-tolerant modular multilevel converter (MMC). The proposed MMC consists of two submodules in the arm and operates without requiring a capacitor voltage balancing algorithm.

However, concerns remain about whether FL-trained models learn in the same way as their centralized-data counterparts. This paper examines the impact of FL on model behavior, utilizing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques and correlation metrics to compare feature importance. By applying two XAI metrics across four public datasets and evaluating multiple FL strategies, we assess how closely federated models align with traditionally trained ones. Although models often achieve similar classification performance (Matthews's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) > 0.9), we observe significant differences in attribution patterns, especially in async approaches, with correlation scores below 0.7 Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) on several occasions and below 0.4 SRCC for the worst scenario. These findings suggest that identical performance does not always imply equivalent learning. Furthermore, since these findings were obtained under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) settings, it is expected that under non-IID settings, the results might be even worse, underscoring the need for explainability-driven validation tools to ensure the reliability, fairness, and trustworthiness of FL models in practice."

A multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is established to minimize annual energy losses and voltage deviations under planning and operational constraints. The model integrates photovoltaic (PV) plants and biomass DGs (BMDGs) into the IEEE 33-bus system. The loading and PV generation uncertainties are modeled by a data-driven probabilistic state-based approach instead of general probability distribution functions (PDFs) to improve the planning reliability. The proposed optimization model is solved using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, incorporating operational constraints using the optimal power flow (OPF) analysis. The results demonstrate significant reductions in energy losses and improvements in voltage profiles, indicating the efficacy of the proposed probabilistic modeling and optimization method."

    "abstract": "Pneumothorax, the abnormal presence of air in the pleural cavity leading to lung collapse, requires rapid and reliable diagnosis. Manual interpretation of chest radiographs can be time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. In this paper, we propose a unified deep learning pipeline that integrates four modules: (i) automated image quality control using blur detection, (ii) ResNet50-based classification of pneumothorax versus normal cases, (iii) mask-based localization of affected regions, and (iv) an explainability layer using LIME to highlight clinically relevant areas. Trained and evaluated on the SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation dataset (12,000+annotated radiographs), the system achieved 99.7% classification accuracy, 99.5% precision, 99.3% recall, and a Dice coefficient of 0.91 for segmentation. Unlike prior works that focus solely on classification or segmentation, our novelty lies in the integration of model-agnostic interpretability (LIME) within a complete diagnostic pipeline, thereby improving both accuracy and trustworthiness. By combining performance, robustness, and interpretability, the proposed framework offers a practical tool for deployment in real-world clinical settings."

    "abstract": "To investigate the fatty acid composition, antibacterial activity, and antioxidant activity of badger oil, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyze the components of badger oil after methylation treatment with potassium hydroxide-methanol alkaline catalysis. Antibacterial activity was evaluated via gradient dilution against six microbial strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined to evaluate its antibacterial spectrum and capacity. Antioxidant activity was assessed by measuring DPPH, ABTS, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and total reducing power. A total of 14 fatty acids were detected in badger oil, with the main components being oleic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid. Unsaturated fatty acids accounted for 65.27 % of the total, with oleic acid being the most abundant. Different concentrations of badger oil exhibited varying antibacterial activities.

The second, an “aggregated analysis” workflow, is designed for high-throughput environments and maintains 86.2% accuracy by analyzing statistical trends in traffic data. Evaluated on the VNFCYBERDATA dataset, our fine-tuned models outperform traditional methods.

    "abstract": "Plugged-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are crucial for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of microgrid (MG) operations. PHEVs can optimize energy use and lessen dependency on grid electricity by serving as mobile energy storage units that can store excess renewable energy and release it during periods of high demand. Their bi-directional power transaction capability commonly termed as grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) facilitates frequency regulation and load balancing, and their incorporation with demand side management (DSM) programs reduces operating expenses, encourages the use of renewable energy sources, and guarantees a dependable, sustainable microgrid system. This paper proposes a recently developed one-to-one based optimizer (OOBO) to minimize the operation cost of a MG system for varying arrival state-of-charge (SOC) and arrival-departure period of PHEV. Two different load shifting strategies are also implemented and their impact on cost-effective operation of the MG system is compared. Numerical results show that higher arrival SOC and price dependent optimal load shifting method are economic practices among the others."

This industry is a highly cost driven market where major OEMs in India are fighting to strive in the Indian market. In a day-to-day operation of 3-Wheeler EV more that 10 % of the vehicle kinetic energy can be converted back into useful electrical energy back into the battery under urban driving cycle.A reverse throttle mechanism which will enable single throttle operation i.e. both acceleration and deceleration has been proposed to further enhance the driving operation and simultaneously prompts energy recovery. A Reverse throttle regeneration control strategy has been developed and integrated in the Vehicle Control Unit which is based daily driving operation. Typical Real World Usage Pattern driving cycles are simulated to understand the effectiveness of the reverse throttle control strategy. Results shows that using the reverse throttle regeneration operation there is a substantial increase in the ease of driving, enhanced energy recovery rate and ensuring safety while braking. The other advantages of using reverse throttle are also highlighted in this research."

    "abstract": "Computational Microscopy applications require substantial computing resources that local infrastructure cannot efficiently provide. Cloud-based virtual machines (VMs) can provide computing resources on demand. However, traditional one-on-one VM assignment has the issue of capacity availability especially for high-performance GPUs. This paper presents a novel cloud-based microservices architecture for the ZEISS X-ray Microscopy Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (ART) 5.0 [1], featuring dynamic virtual machine (VM) pool allocation and intelligent resource management. Our system employs two specialized services: a deployment service for VM lifecycle management, and a restart service for runtime operations. The deployment service implements Microsoft Entra ID SSO for administrative access while the restart service uses JSON Web Token (JWT)-based authentication with client certificates for customer operations. The key innovation is a dynamic VM pool allocation system that allocates pre-provisioned VMs from multiple regions and data centers. Experimental results demonstrate <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$33-40 \\%$</tex> provisioning time reduction and 66 % cost reduction. The architecture supports seamless third-party integration through comprehensive REST APIs for system management and gRPC for real-time, large-data streaming applications, enabling automated workflows for enterprise deployment. This architecture is based on Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure but can be potentially migrated to other major cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), etc."

    "abstract": "Even though it is usually assumed that data centers can always operate at maximum capacity, there have been recent scenarios where the amount of electricity that can be used by data centers evolve over time. Hence, the number of available processors is not a constant anymore. In this work, we assume that jobs can be checkpointed before a resource change. Indeed, in the scenarios that we consider, the resource provider warns the user before a change in the number of processors. It is thus possible to anticipate and take checkpoints before the change happens, such that no work is ever lost. The goal is then to maximize the goodput and/or the minimum yield of jobs within the next section (time between two changes in the number of processors). We model the problem and design greedy solutions and sophisticated dynamic programming algorithms with some optimality results for jobs of infinite duration, and adapt the algorithms to finite jobs. A comprehensive set of simulations, building on real-life job sets, demonstrates the performance of the proposed algorithms. Most algorithms achieve a useful platform utilization (goodput) of over 95%. With infinite jobs, the algorithms also keep fairness by having a relative minimum yield above 0.8, meaning that each job gets a good access to the platform (80% of the time that it would have had if each job had its perfect share of the platform). For finite jobs, the minimum yield can be low since very short new jobs may have to wait until the beginning of the next section to start (and finish), significantly impacting their yield. However, for 75% of the jobs within each workload, the yield ratio between these jobs is at most at a factor two, hence demonstrating the fairness of the proposed algorithms."

    "abstract": "The selection of the appropriate artificial intelligence (AI) model from a variety of different classes of models for network security is a challenging and time-consuming task. In this study, we introduce a meta-learning approach for optimizing model selection for network intrusion detection tasks that eliminates the necessity of repetitively training and evaluating each model on new tasks. The first phase of our framework involves training an ensemble of seven state-of-the-art AI models, each with varied hyperparameters resulting in a total of 64 unique model configurations. By leveraging the output probabilities of these models as inputs to train our meta-learning regressor, we generate expected probabilities that predict the performance of each model configuration on unseen data. Our meta-learning mechanism streamlines model selection by using a regressor to identify the optimal configuration, avoiding costly evaluations. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing superior performance on the NSL-KDD and CICIDS-2017 datasets with significantly lower inference time compared to conventional model selection strategies. We evaluated our regressor models using frequency analysis to rank model configurations based on their top-1, top-5, and top-10 performance across datasets. We also used the Hit-at-k metric to precisely measure how well our approach selects the suitable AI model for unseen samples and how predicted probabilities align with true class probabilities. We apply paired t-tests to determine whether the performance differences among the proposed meta-learners are statistically significant. We also conduct a benchmark evaluation of two prominent automated machine learning (ML) frameworks, H2O AutoML and Auto-sklearn, using our two datasets. We have released our source codes for the community to access as a baseline framework for meta-learning in network intrusion detection tasks."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of drone technology and its widespread application in various fields, low-altitude drone detection has become an important technological approach for ensuring public safety and implementing effective supervision. This paper addresses issues such as small drone targets, object occlusions, and environmental interference leading to missed detections and false alarms in complex backgrounds by proposing a solution based on the YOLOv10n algorithm. The algorithm first introduces a BiFPN module into the neck of the YOLOv10n model, combining the advantages of PANet (Path Aggregation Network) and weighted feature fusion to promote efficient integration of feature information at different levels. It also employs a Concatenation module within the same layer to enhance the network’s ability to detect small targets. Additionally, in the Backbone section, the C2f module is replaced with the C2fCIB module to increase the capability to capture features at different scales and improve small target detection performance. Finally, inspired by the TOOD structure, the Head part incorporates a DCNv2 module to boost the network’s ability to handle complex environments and multi-scale targets. Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv10 model achieved mAP@50 of 93.8% and mAP@50:95 of 65.5%, with a model size of 1.6M parameters. Compared to the baseline YOLOv10n model, this represents accuracy improvements of 2.3% and 5.6% respectively, while reducing the parameter count by 42.5%. In summary, the enhanced model effectively handles low-altitude drone detection tasks under diverse environments, providing robust technical support for public safety, intelligent decision-making, and regulatory requirements."

    "abstract": "Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) is a new technology that can achieve beamforming in the electromagnetic wave domain, which greatly benefits the reduction of processing delays. Motivated by the constraints of limited satellite resources, this letter proposes a SIM-enabled satellite integrated sensing and communication system. Specifically, the SIM-equipped satellite conducts dual-function precoding in the wave domain, without traditional digital beamformers, to simultaneously sense multiple aerial targets and serve multiple downlink communication users. To realize this, we employ a penalty function-based gradient ascent algorithm to maximize the sum rate of communication while ensuring the sensing performance. Simulation results validate the high compatibility of SIM technology with satellite systems, highlighting its potential for future applications."

    "abstract": "Achieving effective self-interference cancellation (SIC) in full-duplex (FD) wireless communication systems under time-varying channel conditions remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel adaptive SIC solution through leveraging Hyper Neural Networks (HyperNet) and incremental learning (IL). Unlike the existing methods that rely on offline training or lack real-time adaptability, our approach enables autonomous learning and fast adaptation to the complex, nonlinear, and time-varying nature of self-interference (SI) channels. It effectively addresses dynamic adaptation challenges, such as catastrophic forgetting, through the use of experience replay (ER). Our experimental results show that traditional model-based methods exhibit limited adaptability under dynamic channel conditions, while conventional data-driven models fail to maintain consistent performance without the adaptive capabilities provided by IL. In contrast, the proposed HyperNet-based IL model reduces training time by 33% and achieves three times faster convergence compared to a standalone HyperNet trained separately for each static condition. Extensive evaluations using simulated datasets that emulate real-world scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves SI suppression down to the noise floor. It also delivers significantly lower computational complexity and training time. These improvements collectively enhance the efficiency and reliability of FD communication systems operating in dynamic wireless environments."

Therefore, active cell balancing is important for safe operation and long life of the batteries. In this study, active cell balancing is simulated with Model Predictive Control (MPC) in MATLAB/Simulink, and its comparison with the performance of conventional balancing methods in load and no-load situations is analyzed. The two balancing topologies analyzed were ćuk converter-based balancing and bidirectional multiple transformer-based balancing. The study aimed to look into how effective MPC was in optimizing the charge transfer with regard to balancing time and efficiency. Simulation results showed that MPC offered advantages over the others in terms of SoC equalization time, thus confirming the efficacy of MPC towards EV battery applications and performance."

    "abstract": "Buffer overflow attacks remain a critical threat to software security, with existing defenses like ASLR and stack canaries proving insufficient against sophisticated exploits. Nvariant systems, which execute diverse program variants to thwart coordinated attacks, offer a promising solution. However, manually generating such variants is costly and unscalable. To address this, we propose an AI-driven pipeline that automates the creation of N-secure code variants by leveraging programming expertise embedded in existing code repositories. As a foundational step, this work benchmarks the ability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to identify semantically similar code snippets from a repository that match the coding constructs of a given human-written code. We evaluate multiple RAG architectures on their retrieval accuracy, diversity of returned snippets, and ability to surface distinct coding expertise (e.g., security-aware implementations). Our analysis reveals how RAG models can systematically curate programming variants that preserve functionality while differing in structure, libraries, or security practices. The retrieved snippets will later train a modelfree reinforcement learning (RL) agent to generate N diverse variants, introducing security by diversity against buffer overflow attacks. By rigorously assessing RAG models now, we ensure the subsequent RL phase has high-quality, relevant exemplars that are critical for generating robust variants. We evaluate two different RAG models: Code specific RAG model and a Generalized RAG model. L2 distance and cosine similarity metrics are used to measure the ability of RAG model identify code segments from a given human code repository that capture diverse coding human expertise. We believe our work bridges AI-powered code retrieval and generative security, offering a scalable path to N-variant systems. Our proposed scalable path to N-variant systems involves feeding the output of RAG to a model free Reinforcement Learning algorithm."

    "abstract": "Node authentication in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is essential for ensuring security, data integrity, and efficient operation in resource-constrained environments. It helps to prevent malicious node attacks, such as impersonation and data tampering, by verifying the identities of participating nodes. In this paper we propose an innovative authentication framework which combines artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with Identity-Based Authentication (IBA) methods to bolster security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). While traditional cryptographic techniques are valuable, they often fall short in adapting to the changing threat landscapes commonly found in resourcelimited WSN settings. Our methodology utilizes machine learning algorithms to scrutinize the behavioral patterns of sensor nodes, resulting in a multi-layered authentication architecture that merges the benefits of cryptographic validation with behavioral analysis. This new framework shows marked improvements in identifying unusual authentication attempts, all while keeping energy consumption in check-a vital factor for WSNs. Experimental findings indicate a detection rate of 93.2% for complex attack vectors, accompanied by a mere 2.5% false positive rate. These results imply that integrating AI with IBA is a promising strategy for enhancing the security of future WSNs while simultaneously extending their operational lifespan."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) face escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly from GPS spoofing and jamming attacks, which endanger flight safety and mission integrity. This paper introduces a novel UAV cybersecurity framework that integrates statistical extreme value meta-learning (EVML) with a dual-path classifier to detect and classify GPS attacks. The method overcomes the key limitations of some existing approaches, such as excessive training data needs, zero-day threat vulnerability, and disjointed detection/classification. In particular, the proposed framework includes two stages. The first one enables zero-day attack detection through few-shot meta-learning with prototype-based anomaly detection where support sets contain only benign flight data while query sets include both benign samples and synthetically generated attack patterns. Moreover, a prototypical OpenMax layer and extreme value theory are exploited to identify suspicious patterns in GPS telemetry data. The second stage utilizes a novel dual-path architecture that independently processes position-related and signal-related features to classify detected attacks as spoofing or jamming. Our results on real-world attack data demonstrates that the proposed method has exceptional performance with 97.33 % detection accuracy and 0% false alarm rate, which significantly outperform the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, attack classification achieves 82.33 % accuracy for spoofing and 94.31 % for jamming attacks, with an overall F1 score of 0.88."

    "abstract": "Recommendation systems play a vital role in various digital platforms, including e-commerce, movie streaming, and online learning environments. Their primary function is to predict user preferences and provide personalized suggestions. In a recommendation system, rating prediction is a core task that aims to predict the rating or score a user would give to an item (e.g., movie, product, etc.) based on their past behavior or preferences, as well as the behavior of other users. The goal is to make personalized recommendations by predicting which items users are likely to rate highly or engage with in the future. In this study, we will discuss four models: Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), Singular Value Decomposition-Based Matrix Factorization (SVD-MF), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) to figure out how well they predict ratings. We used the MovieLens dataset to check which one of these models performs best for rating prediction. We trained each model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss to track mistakes, adjusted them with the Adam optimizer, and checked their scores with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results show that SVD-MF performed worst, NCF performed somewhat better but GNNs and HGNNs give the best results, with HGNNs having the least RMSE."

    "abstract": "This paper studies transformer models, especially Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), to identify sarcasm in text. Detecting sarcasm is difficult because it depends heavily on understanding the specific context, which makes it an implicit challenge. Sarcasm often relies on subtle cues, such as tone, word choice, and contextual references, making it difficult for traditional machine learning models to identify accurately. The primary goal is to enhance the model’s ability to effectively distinguish sarcastic expressions by leveraging BERT’s deep contextual understanding. This capability helps the model grasp the complex connections between words and their context, both from left to right and right to left. This approach is particularly valuable in sarcasm detection, where the meaning often contradicts the literal text. Additionally, the research explores BERT’s cross-cultural adaptability by evaluating its performance on datasets in various languages and cultural contexts. This is achieved through transfer learning, where a model trained on one dataset (e.g., English) is adapted to a new dataset in a different language or cultural context without requiring extensive retraining. The goal is to assess how well BERT can generalize across different social and cultural norms, which may affect how sarcasm is expressed and understood. The findings demonstrate that BERT holds significant potential for cross-cultural sarcasm detection, showing that transformer-based models can be effective in diverse settings."

District cooling systems have emerged as a promising solution to meet this growing demand, offering significant benefits in energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. In addition to these benefits, District Cooling Systems (DCSs) are essential in enhancing grid flexibility by providing Demand Response (DR) capabilities through Thermal Energy Storage (TES) and load shifting. The pipeline network also acts as a TES medium, using its dynamic thermal properties and inherent thermal inertia to absorb, store, and slowly release cooling energy. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of district cooling systems as a DR mechanism, highlighting various DR strategies that can be implemented, such as load curtailment, real-time pricing, and automated demand-side management. It also examines how these strategies can be integrated into energy infrastructure to optimize grid performance. Furthermore, this paper reviews national and international pilot projects demonstrating district cooling systems' effectiveness in supporting DR initiatives. Additionally, it addresses the technical challenges associated with integrating district cooling systems as DR."

    "abstract": "Conventional methods for measuring joint angles and body movement, such as goniometers and inertial measurement units (IMUs), can be impractical for home-based use due to the need for physical setup, calibration, or supervision. This has led to a growing interest in AI-based, markerless pose estimation techniques as a more convenient alternative. This study compares two real-time AI-powered computer vision models—MediaPipe and You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), specifically the YOLOv8n and YOLOv8s variants for their reliability, error percentage, and inference time in tracking knee joint angles during three rehabilitation exercises: Seated Knee Extension, Half Squat, and Sit-to-Stand. During the rehabilitation exercises, the knee was connected to a goniometer and performed by one participant while another person supervised to compare its readings with computer-based measurements. Each exercise set was repeated four times under supervision. The objective of this study is to develop a non-invasive and low-cost motion tracking framework suitable for remote rehabilitation, aiming to improve patient monitoring and exercise compliance. MediaPipe outperformed both YOLOv8 models, demonstrating the lowest error at full extension <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\left(180^{\\circ}\\right)$</tex> at 0.7779 % and the fastest inference time (approximately 35 ms). YOLOv8n performed well at 90° flexion (error: <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{0. 0 5 \\%}$</tex>) but showed a higher error at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{180}^{\\circ} \\boldsymbol{(} \\mathbf{4.94 \\%} \\boldsymbol{)}$</tex>.

This project presents an innovative approach to enhancing the capabilities of video surveillance systems through the integration of YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, for the specific task of human Violence detection. The proposed Intelligent Video Surveillance System leverages the speed and accuracy of YOLOv8 to detect violent activities in live video streams. YOLO’s ability to simultaneously identify and classify objects within a single pass through the network makes it particularly well-suited for real-time surveillance applications. The system employs a YOLOv8 model that has been fine-tuned on a diverse dataset of violence and normal activities, enabling it to distinguish between various forms of human Violence, such as physical altercations, aggressive gestures, and unmannered Pose. Key components of the system include video feed acquisition, preprocessing, YOLOv8-based object detection, and post-processing techniques to reduce false positives. The proposed system offers several advantages over traditional surveillance approaches. It significantly reduces the workload of human operators by automating the detection process, ensuring continuous monitoring, and responding promptly to potentially dangerous situations. Moreover, the integration of YOLOv8 allows for scalability and adaptability, making it suitable for deployment in various surveillance environments, from public spaces and transportation hubs to private facilities."

    "abstract": "Medical text categorization is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current training data for large language models usually come from the Internet, and thus the generalization ability of large language models is poor when it comes to domains such as healthcare. To address this problem, we propose a DL framework called Note-BERT to improve the model’s classification effect in the case of sparse samples. Current mainstream language models usually use a single feature extraction algorithm to convert textual information into signals, which is not sufficient to fully extract the information in text. Therefore, we propose to fuse the features extracted from text by basic BERT and pre-trained RNN feature extraction modules. A small amount of data is not enough to support a transformer model to perform the classification task correctly. Based on this problem we also designed a keyword extraction module to enhance the weight of disease-related words on the feature vector. In addition, we expanded the dataset using the masking mechanism of BERT to improve the robustness of the Note-BERT model. Experimental results show that our Note-BERT tests 3% more correctly on the congenital heart disease ultrasound report dataset compared to the BERT model. This shows its potential as a classification framework for sparse datasets."

    "abstract": "Against the background of digital media, this study explores Influencer-Generated Content (IGC) creation on Xiaohongshu (Rednote) through semi-structured interviews with 11 influencers. This study aims to reveal how influencers adapt their content to fit algorithmic imaginary. It indicates that they adopt data-driven strategies, structured optimization, and expressions of “real sense”. Such practices lead to real-time iteration but cause content homogenization, exaggeration, and authenticity compromise. Influencers, driven by traffic anxiety, commercial pressure, and recognition of fans, navigate tensions between algorithmic expectations and ethical content creation. It constructs an interaction framework between the algorithmic imaginary and IGC creation, identifies core characteristics of IGC creation and the reverse shaping pathway, and clarifies psychological motivations, offering references for platform algorithm optimization and ethical creation."

Traditional Braille learning poses significant challenges, particularly for late-onset blindness cases requiring prolonged training. This work presents a contactless Braille recognition system based on a fully integrated optical sensor platform. The monolithic GaN-on-sapphire chip serves dual functions as a light source and a photodetector, minimizing the device footprint. Through the ray-tracing simulation, the hemispheric epoxy lens with optimized geometric parameters is incorporated for consistent and excellent Braille detection. The integrated device demonstrates rapid response characteristics and operational stability when processing arranged Braille patterns, with extracted photocurrent signals processed by microcontroller circuitry. The line-scanning results undergo wireless transmission via Bluetooth to portable mobile devices, enabling the conversion into accessible audio-visual formats. This innovative design not only enables efficient Braille recognition but also offers potential for advanced human-machine interfaces with broad applicability in assistive technologies and beyond."

    "abstract": "Specific attributes of microfluidic adsorption-based sensors of biomolecules are the process of convection of the analyzed sample in a flow-through reaction chamber, and slow diffusion of large analyte molecules in the sample toward the adsorption sites on the sensing surface and away from them. Apart from that, some biomolecules (e.g. proteins) interact between themselves, thus forming multilayer adsorbed structures, while some experiments are designed so that target molecules capturing and signal amplification are achieved through multilayer adsorption. Therefore, it is important to take into account mass transfer (convection and diffusion), and multilayer adsorption in the analysis of microfluidic biosensor response. In this paper, we present a simple model of sensor response in the case of two-layer adsorption coupled with mass transfer. The developed model is an important result, because it enables the analysis of the influence of mass transfer processes on the sensor response. This is useful for the optimization of sensor design and experiments, which are aimed to decrease the influence of mass transfer on the response kinetics. The model also enables correct interpretation of measurement results. Additionally, the model is devised in a convenient form for future analyses of stochastic fluctuations of sensor response, and for the development of a theoretical model of sensor adsorption-desorption noise."

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play a critical role in environmental monitoring, surveillance, and battlefield communications. There has been an increasing demand for WSNs that optimize network lifetime and energy consumption, a critical design challenge. Previous research has made use of two separate optimization paths: global deployment geometry to reduce communication costs to transmit to the Base Station (BS), or optimization of local network topology to improve routing efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the Optimal Rhombic Cylindrical Hybrid Intelligent Deployment (ORCHID) protocol that will synergize the two optimization paths. ORCHID operates by considering tessellation within a geometrically optimized cylinder. This structure enables an intelligent protocol architecture, featuring a deterministic, energy-aware cluster head selection process that replaces probabilistic mechanisms found in other protocols. We will compare the performance of this protocol to a previously proposed cylindrical LEACH implementation. Through simulations, ORCHID shows improvements in network lifetime, cumulative throughput, and energy consumption. The protocol has very low overhead, which will be scaled along with performance to compare to the most recent similar protocols such as PEG-GA-VC(3) (2019), a Hybrid k-means clustering algorithm (2017), and LEACH3D (2015)."

Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage has received increasing attention for its ability to enable data matching while protecting security and confidentiality. However, existing multi-party PPRL methods, though efficient in data integration, suffer from risks of private key leakage and involve overly complex processes. To address these limitations, we propose an Attribute-Based Encryption approach for PPRL. In our scheme, private keys are generated based on user attributes, ensuring that only users whose attributes satisfy the predefined access policy can decrypt the data. This effectively mitigates the risk of private key leakage by means of an efficient access control policy. Experiments show that this method has higher linkage quality and data matching accuracy than other PPRL methods, better privacy protection, and is more suitable for secure computing."

This paper presents an Enhanced Lossless Secret Image Sharing (SIS) scheme designed to securely divide grayscale, color, and high-bit-depth medical images into multiple shares. The method employs polynomial interpolation over large prime fields combined with efficient bit-packing to achieve exact recovery without pixel distortion or truncation. By supporting extended bit-depths such as 24-bit color and 32-bit medical imaging, the scheme overcomes traditional limitations in lossless reconstruction, security, and computational efficiency. The proposed approach simplifies share generation while maintaining strict threshold-based secrecy, making it highly suitable for secure image sharing across critical domains like healthcare, defense, and secure multimedia transmission."

Some organizations such as Toastmaster international try to help people to improve their public speaking skills by providing a supportive and positive environment for individual to practice, and speakers could receive feedback from their peers on their performance during each meeting. It is expected that there is a tool which could provide assessment more often, easy and without anybody help. Assessing speaking ability is complex, involving both feature extraction from unimodal data such as text, speech, and images, and fusion of cross-modal data, and is a challenging problem to be solved in the field of multimodal learning analytics. In this paper, we first design different feature extraction models for the three modalities of visual, auditory and textual information. The proposed facial feature extraction model based on improved PFLD is able to use a multi-scale region learning strategy to better capture the details and differences of facial features and enhance the extraction of visual features. The proposed Transformer-TCN speech feature extraction model consists of an encoder module, a feature fusion module, and a time-domain convolutional network, which improves the accuracy and reliability when processing time-series data. Thirdly, we used a pre-trained BERT model with a 12-layer Transformer structure for text feature extraction. Based on the extracted features from three modalities, this paper proposes a TMJP(Tri-Modal Joint Representation) learning method based on the cross-modal Transformer, which is centered on the cross-modal attention mechanism. The cross-modal attention mechanism adapts the flow from one modality to another by focusing on information from different modalities. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed TMJP public speech evaluation model achieves the best performance in all three metrics compared to other multimodal analysis models, and could be used for Toastmasters students public speaking evaluation tool. When more modal data are available in the future, it is flexible to extend to four, five modal data or even more based on the design principle of the method."

Furthermore, moving to electric vehicles (EVs) is an essential step toward sustainable transportation. Even with government programs and increased awareness, EV adoption is still quite low. The growth of the EV industry and consumer preferences are influenced by several factors, including technological, policy, infrastructure, and economic considerations. In this study, thirteen main factors influencing EV adoption in India are carefully analyzed and ranked using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). FAHP is a popular multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique that utilizes expert opinions and pairwise comparisons to provide a systematic assessment of multiple elements. Major drivers examined in the study include battery technology, car performance, government incentives, charging infrastructure, and upfront expenses. By giving these parameters relative weights, the study determines which enablers and barriers are most important in affecting the adoption of EVs. Policy awareness and lack of Government Incentives and Financial Support are the primary factors influencing EV adoption, according to the study, with Battery technology, high upfront cost, and coming of age being of less priority. Consumers' worries about high upfront costs and a lack of charging infrastructure continue to highlight the need for new financing options and battery innovations."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have seen extensive growth in both civilian and military sectors, driven by their versatility, ease of deployment, and expanding range of applications. However, this expansion has also exposed UAV systems to a growing number of cybersecurity threats. The MAVLink protocol, widely adopted for UAV-ground station communication, lacks native encryption, making it susceptible to interception and manipulation. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution based on the use of Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect cryptographic keys and secure data transmission using the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm. Our approach integrates the HSM into the drone system, ensuring that sensitive keys are securely generated, stored, and accessed. We present the architecture, implementation details, and simulation results that confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance the security of UAV communications with minimal performance overhead."

This study, grounded in cold climate characteristics, creatively investigated the quantitative impact of fan placement within Personalized Thermal Comfort Systems (PCS) on localized thermal environment regulation in learning areas using Cradle CFD software. A room model incorporating a human body, desk, and fan was constructed. Simulations of three typical fan configurations-front-facing, left, and right-were conducted using the RNG turbulence model, monitoring the temperature and thermal distribution at key human body parts. Results demonstrated that fan placement significantly influenced personalized thermal comfort and cooling efficiency across different human body parts. The research revealed that the forced convection heat transfer mechanism, driven by direct airflow, is crucial for enhancing heat transfer efficiency. The front-facing placement, by fully leveraging forced convection, exhibited a significant advantage in cooling effectiveness for the face, chest, and legs. Its overall temperature reduction was substantially superior to side placements; specifically, face cooling effectiveness decreased by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$32-76 {\\%}$</tex> when using side placements compared to the front-facing setup.

    "abstract": "Building windows in northern winters exhibit significant heat loss in the 1000-2000 nm thermal radiation band, where heating systems primarily radiate. The insufficient spectral selectivity of traditional glass leads to low heating energy efficiency. Existing research reveals insufficient fine-grained optimization of multilayer glass for this specific band and a lack of precise quantification of the nonlinear coupling effects between thickness combinations and thermal radiation transmittance. This paper aims to minimize radiant heat transmission through a three-layer glass structure in the 1000-2000 nm band by optimizing the thickness of each layer. Inspired by neural network training principles, the study parameterizes glass thicknesses and constructs a forward model from thickness to spectral transmission characteristics based on thin-film optics theory. The total transmitted radiant energy within the target band is defined as the optimization objective function. Automatic differentiation is employed to calculate gradients, and the Adam optimization algorithm, combined with a multi-start strategy, is used for iterative optimization of the thickness combination. The results indicate that the optimal three-layer glass thickness combination is L1* ≈ 9.39mm, L2* ≈ 8.61mm, and L3* ≈ 9.49mm. With this structure, the total transmitted radiant energy in the 1000-2000 nm band is reduced to 126.79 W/m,<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> approximately 32.11% lower than that of a single-layer glass of equivalent total thickness, significantly enhancing the blockage of specific-band thermal radiation.

The developed model is evaluated on the balanced IoT healthcare dataset, comprising of 67, 545 instances and 5 physiological features labelled with binary anomaly indicators. The Adaptive-LSTM architecture integrates dual-layer LSTM blocks with a dropout rate of 40% which is followed by a dense sigmoid classifier.

Results show that the Adaptive-LSTM achieved a classification accuracy of 99.68%, while maintaining a latency as low as 0.89 seconds. The simulated energy consumption is 1.05 mJ. While GRU offer faster inference time of 0.78 seconds, its accuracy is $\\mathbf{9 7. 4 5 \\%}$. Adaptive-LSTM provides a strong trade-off between the classification accuracy, computation time and energy efficiency.

Traditional filters like the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and its variants assume ideal Line-of-Sight (LOS) scenarios and struggle in complex indoor environments. To address this, we propose the NLOS-Aware Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (NA-AEKF), designed to improve robustness and accuracy under dynamic conditions. NA-AEKF uses machine learning to classify real-time measurements as LOS or NLOS, adjusting filter parameters accordingly. This integration improves adaptability to changing conditions and mitigates NLOS-related errors. Simulations show that NA-AEKF outperforms EKF, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), the Adaptive EKF (AEKF) and the Improved adaptive EKF (I-AEKF) [1], achieving higher precision in complex indoor settings."

Unlike other models, he existing deep learning models apply a computational burden and require a pre-trained network, so they utilize large scale frameworks which are not efficient. Thus, PneuNet's design adopts a seven-layered structure that achieves a better balance between functionality and efficiency. The model has been trained and tested for a clinically verified dataset containing 5856 publicly available images. There is a systematic algorithmic approach to preprocessing aimed at high-quality data augmentation and standardization. With PneuNet, the accuracy reached is of 96% in the test set with good precision and recall particularly in cases of pneumonia. PneuNet's structure offers progressive filter scaling, global average pooling, and dropout regularization, enabling its use in resource-constrained environments. The results suggest that PneuNet significantly improves diagnostic support for health systems that lack radiologists or high-end systems making it a practical solution."

However, leveraging the \"mobile energy storage\" capability of EVs, combined with an orderly charging/discharging strategy, can not only assist microgrids in peak shaving and valley filling—enhancing economic efficiency and stability—but also substitute traditional energy storage systems, thereby reducing microgrid operation and investment costs. This study proposes a V2G capacity substitution factor to quantify EVs' energy storage substitution effect and establishes an optimization model to minimize total power supply costs. The model considers time-of-use electricity pricing, actual EV travel demands, EV usage patterns in industrial parks, and other uncertainties to optimize energy storage configuration in a PV-storage-charging integrated microgrid. Probabilistic analysis is employed to mitigate source-load uncertainty, and Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to derive the V2G capacity substitution factor and the system’s minimal electricity procurement cost."

First, hospitals may be unable to provide large-scale annotated medical datasets with regional characteristics. Second, the heterogeneous morphological features of brain atrophy, which are highly indicative of AD, have not been fully exploited in existing diagnostic tasks. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Morphology-Aware Transformer Network (EMAT-Net). This method leverages a pretrained Transformer-in-Transformer (TNT) model and introduces two key architectural innovations: a Morphology-Aware Patch Encoder (MAPE) and a Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (ConvFFN). In addition, a two-stage training strategy is employed, enabling the model to be finetuned with limited data while incorporating feature extraction capabilities that adapt to regional characteristics. Extensive experiments on the publicly available ADNI dataset demonstrate the significant advantages of EMAT-Net, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models trained on the full dataset while using only 20% of the labeled data."

An integrated multi-output AC-DC-DC power supply is developed. The design uses a forward-boost LLC topology and PWM modulation to convert AC 220V to DC 28V, which is further converted into four regulated outputs: DC +5V/1A, DC -5V/1.5A, and DC ±12V/1A. A three-level cascaded topology and a feedforward-feedback compound control circuit are used to suppress low-frequency ripple. Dual power supply parallel superposition and PWM modulation reduce high-frequency ripple. Active ripple compensation, multi-level π-type Chebyshev filtering, and three-dimensional layered differential shielding improve EMC performance. Experimental results show conversion efficiency exceeds 88%, with peak-to-peak ripple ≤28mV. The design meets GJB151B EMC standards and ensures reliable power delivery for drone swarm launch systems in high-altitude environments."

One of the popular methods for tackling the PQ issue in the power system is the integration of a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) with solar PV. In this article, PV-DSTATCOM is linked with a three-phase weak grid under unbalanced and non-linear loading circumstances. This study proposes a control technique derived from unit vector templates (UVT). The UVT approach regulates the PV-DSTATCOM, and the maximum power point technique (MPPT) is utilized for controlling the boost converter. The grid and PV-DSTATCOM system have been designed and implemented using the MATLAB/Simulink platform, and the simulation results have been authenticated on a real-time simulator based on OPAL-RT. This control method enhances voltage quality at the point of common coupling (PCC) during grid voltage variations, effectively reduces the harmonic components in the grid current, under nonlinear load condition and under unbalanced load conditions, the grid current remains balanced. The findings show the efficacy of the UVT-based control over the synchronous reference frame-based controller."

The paper proposes a strategy for accurate proportional power sharing among inverters with less transients and fast dynamics in case of CIL (constant impedance load) and CPL (constant power load). A modified robust droop controller based strategy is proposed for voltage source inverter and small signal stability based modelling is used to identify and determine the control parameters to achieve reasonable damping using eigenvalue analysis. An equivalent thevenin model of VSI is formed and bode plots are drawn for corresponding transfer functions to select appropriate value of virtual resistor. The improved steady state and transient performance are achieved simultaneously with the proposed strategy thereby contributing better dynamics. Simulations with proposed approach are done in the MATLAB/SIMULINK plateform and its comparison is done to justify the efficacy of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of focal and non-focal EEG signals is critical for effective diagnosis and management of epilepsy. This work presents a novel hybrid framework that uniquely integrates signal processing and image-based analysis to capture the complex, nonlinear nature of brain dynamics. Filtered EEG signals are converted into composite 2D visual representations by combining Poincare plots, spectrograms, and recurrence plots-offering a rich fusion of time-frequency and phase-space information. Unlike conventional methods, the proposed approach extracts discriminative features not only from these hybrid images using statistical, entropy, and texture-based techniques but also from signal-domain characteristics rooted in Poincare lag analysis. These two domains are strategically fused into a unified feature space that enhances model generalization. Among the evaluated classifiers, an ensemble combining XGBoost and AdaBoost achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.87%, along with robust sensitivity, specificity, and calibration performance. The proposed methodology demonstrates significant potential as a reliable, automated tool for focal EEG detection and offers a novel direction for integrative, image-assisted neurodiagnostic systems."

    "abstract": "Battery management systems are a crucial part of electric vehicles (EVs). Rechargeable batteries are the main fuel source of modern motorized EVs. In commercial EV battery packs, two of the most important parameters are the State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH). Real-time charge estimation of the battery is a preliminary and integral part of the battery management system. Over the decade, accurate SOC estimation methods have been an important field of study as electric mobility becomes more prevalent around the world. This paper proposes a state space model of a lithium-ion battery and estimates the SOC using a discrete Luenberger observer in dynamic load conditions to observe the SOC variation with the real and estimated models in a noisy environment. Also, the equivalent circuit model (ECM) is considered for the battery to calculate the numerical equations of the state observer. With the help of the initial SOC, a piecewise linear interpolation is used to find the SOC-OCV (open circuit voltage) relationship. The terminal voltage is also estimated from the true voltage and a Luenberger observer. The gain of the Luenberger observer is calculated using the Ackermann method, which is easy to implement in the MATLAB 2023b software used for the validation of the model. The experiment was done with pulse current profiling and dynamic stress testing (DST) to observe the SOC estimation error. The error was observed with simulated Gaussian noise added to the true system to find the observability error distribution in the estimation. The results show minimum error with minimum estimation time."

The PU activity is realistically modeled as a two-state Markov chain, with signals transmitted via Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Simulation results demonstrate that our adaptive threshold approach significantly enhances detection accuracy while reducing total error probability at low SNR conditions (from -25 dB to 0 dB), thus effectively increasing idle channel utilization compared to traditional fixed threshold techniques."

Black Myth: Wukong takes this a step further by using advanced 3D scanning and realtime rendering technologies to digitally reconstruct 27 cultural heritage sites in Shanxi with remarkable detail. This has led to the rise of the popular “Follow Wukong to Explore Shanxi” travel trend. This study explores how the digital recreation of game scenes influences players' travel intentions, using the Stimulus Organism Response model (SOR) as a framework. To gather insights, we surveyed 300 players who had completed the main storyline of Black Myth: Wukong and had either travel experience or plans. The survey examined key factors such as scene realism, destination image, travel intentions, cultural interest, and game engagement. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to assess the effect of scene realism on the destination image, and the Bootstrap method helped test the mediating role of destination image between scene realism and travel intentions. Finally, multi-group comparisons and interaction analyses were conducted to understand how cultural interest and game engagement affect these relationships."

The project aims to automate the labor-intensive and timeconsuming process of collecting golf balls that are scattered across large open areas with a focus on terrain adaptability and efficient mechanical collection. The robot's mechanical platform features a four-wheel drive (4WD) chassis constructed from laser-cut mild steel, powder-coated for enhanced durability in outdoor conditions. This 4WD configuration, powered by 10 -inch BLDC hub motors, provides enhanced traction and stability on uneven terrains typically found in golf driving ranges. A key evolution in mechanical design was the replacement of polycarbonate ball picking components, which were found to cause surface scratches on golf balls, with modular 3D printed PETG discs. These discs offered a smoother finish, effectively eliminating damage to the balls during collection. The modular design also allows for easy assembly, repair, and scaling of the picking mechanism based on operational requirements. On the electronics and control side, the system features a distributed architecture that uses a Raspberry Pi 5 and an ESP32-S3 microcontroller. The Raspberry Pi handles high-level computational tasks such as ball detection and centering using computer vision, utilizing the ROS 2 framework for modular and scalable development. The ESP32-S3, equipped with Micro-ROS, manages real-time control tasks including PID-based motor speed regulation. Communication between the Raspberry Pi and the ESP32-S3 is handled via a serial UART interface, enabling fast and reliable command execution."

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for weather forecasting, traditional meteorological data processing methods face many challenges in the fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data and modeling of spatiotemporal features. In particular, it is difficult to effectively capture complex patterns across time and space in high-dimensional meteorological data with strong spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these problems, this paper proposes a multi-source meteorological data fusion modeling method based on spatiotemporal Transformer. First, in response to the spatiotemporal complexity of meteorological data, this paper designs a spatiotemporal modeling method based on the Transformer architecture, which captures the dependencies of different temporal and spatial scales through the self-attention mechanism, and effectively integrates meteorological data from different sources. Then, combined with the multi-head attention mechanism, this paper dynamically weights multiple meteorological variables, so that key information can be highlighted in the data fusion process while reducing the interference of redundancy and noise. Finally, in order to improve the generalization ability of the model, this paper also introduces residual connection and position encoding technology. The experimental results show that under the condition of single-source data, the mean squared error (MSE) of the spatiotemporal Transformer is 0.066 and the R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> value is 0.975. In addition, in the generalization ability test of different climate regions, the prediction effect of spatiotemporal Transformer in tropical, temperate and cold regions showed high accuracy and stability. In the above data conclusion, spatiotemporal Transformer can effectively capture the spatiotemporal dependencies in meteorological data, provide more accurate predictions, and has strong adaptability and generalization ability."

Conventional diagnostic techniques such as fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are resource-intensive and subject to interobserver variability. To address these limitations, deep learning—particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—has emerged as a powerful tool for automated glaucoma detection. A key enabler of deep learning in this domain is transfer learning, which allows the use of pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 on smaller medical datasets. These models can be fine-tuned to enhance classification and segmentation performance while reducing training time and computational demand. Recent studies have explored strategies such as domain adaptation, self-supervised learning, and multimodal fusion. This paper has provided a review of various deep learning methods and has proposed a system with pretrained models. The proposed model has performed well in terms of loss reduction as well as improvements in precision and recall."

The proposed workflow consists of three main stages. In the first stage, case analysis and design vocabulary generation are conducted using Deepseek, and the extracted design vocabularies are then transformed into conceptual imagery via Midjourney. In the second stage, ControlNet, which utilizes line drawings and semantic segmentation, is employed to generate precise master plans. Finally, Stable Diffusion is applied to produce visual renderings of landscape nodes based on preliminary SketchUp models. The case studies demonstrate that generative AI significantly reshapes the traditional landscape design process, fostering a collaborative “designer decision-AI execution” model. By integrating generative AI tools throughout the entire design workflow, a comprehensive human-AI co-creation system is established, redefining the relationship between designers and technology and giving rise to a new form of productivity driven by complementary strengths."

In this study, a comparative analysis of three frequently used Word Embedding models, namely Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, is performed using three different fiction texts. A sample of the three major genres was selected for the study- the epic of Mahabharata, the Harry Potter fantasy series, and the detective narratives of Sherlock Holmes. The emphasis is made on how these models perform with regards to stylistic features of each particular genre, and in terms of capturing semantic relationships as well as coping with such words that hardly ever appear in different texts. Understanding the behavior of these models in various types of texts allows us to draw useful conclusions for those who use them for the tasks connected with certain genres in the field of NLP."

    "abstract": "Velocity vector imaging (VVI) can suffer from poor signal-to-noise (SNR) conditions, eventually restricting the estimation of velocities at low SNRs. Cascaded dual-polarity wave (CDW) imaging has been shown to enhance blood-SNR, thereby improving cross-correlation-based VVI. However, the CDW decoding process is sensitive to motion, where imperfect summation and cancellation of pulses can lead to reduced amplitude gain and ghost pulses outside the main pulse. Multi/dual-angle transmits, combined with either autocorrelation- or cross-correlation-based axial velocity estimation, are commonly used for VVI. Both techniques have intrinsic limitations, such as speckle decorrelation and aliasing, and strengths, where autocorrelation is known to be more resistant to noise and cross-correlation results in more accurate estimates in high SNR conditions. This study evaluates the benefits of CDW imaging for both autocorrelation- and cross-correlation-based VVI using the FLUST simulation toolbox and experiments, including parabolic and rotational flow scenarios. The results indicate that autocorrelation performs consistently across the entire SNR range, while cross-correlation is more accurate and precise in high SNR conditions. CDW improves estimation performance in low SNR conditions, particularly for estimation of low velocities, with a more substantial performance boost for cross-correlation compared to autocorrelation. In general, CDW imaging shows to be beneficial for VVI, independent of the used velocity estimator."

    "abstract": "Hand-related impairments from stroke and neuromuscular diseases are rising globally, increasing the demand for prosthetic hands using surface electromyography (sEMG) for hand movement and grasp activities. sEMG systems also support human-robot interaction (HRI), aiding assistive robots in manipulator tasks. However, sEMG sensors often struggle to capture comprehensive muscle activity and are vulnerable to external hazards. In such scenarios, classical dimensionality reduction techniques often underperform, particularly when the intrinsic spatial structure of the data is overlooked. Addressing this limitation, local manifold-inspired learning techniques, such as locality preserving projection (LPP), are investigated in this study. In particular, orthogonal LPP (OLPP) helps extracting features from high-dimensional data by leveraging the orthogonal properties of nonlinear mappings from input to feature space. Nevertheless, traditional projection kernels are typically constructed based on Euclidean similarity between data points, making them highly sensitive to noise and outliers. To overcome this challenge, we have incorporated two additional similarity measures derived from the complex Euler space and Grassmannian manifold, which effectively explore the local structure in Riemannian spaces. A novel uncertainty-aware Bayesian model averaging (UaBMA) approach is proposed for integrating similarity weights from various manifolds, thereby enhancing the projection discriminability. Extensive experimental studies on both laboratory-acquired and benchmark NinaPro datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed technique over existing methods."

    "abstract": "This paper integrates two data-driven learnable modules into the conventional distributed multi-sensor resolvable group target tracking (RGTT) framework based on the labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter to improve tracking performance. First, in RGTT scenarios with densely distributed targets, the LMB filter is prone to track fragmentation and label switching, which reduce accuracy and complicate multi-sensor data association. While some studies have attempted to address this, their methods typically overlook the group structure and are often offline and computationally intensive. To overcome this, we propose a track optimization module based on attention mechanism that alleviates these issues efficiently in an online setting. Second, we replace traditional data association algorithms, which rely on fixed similarity metrics, with a track matching module based on message passing network (MPN). This module leverages historical track data and learns to infer latent similarities across sensors, significantly improving matching accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules."

    "abstract": "Medical microwave imaging (MMWI) prototypes have demonstrated potential in various clinical applications. For successful clinical translation, these systems must be reliable and yield consistent results, that is, they must demonstrate high repeatability. This systematic review critically appraises the existing literature on repeatability in MMWI, with particular attention to the protocols, metrics, and outcomes reported. A systematic search of Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and PubMed was conducted on April 29th 2025, identifying 21 studies that quantitatively evaluated repeatability in MMWI. Two reviewers independently performed full-text screening and data extraction, with disagreements resolved through consultation with a third reviewer. Descriptive analyses were performed using tables and figures to characterise study design, methodologies, and findings. Considerable heterogeneity was observed in sample size, imaging protocols, and the selection of repeatability metrics. Almost all studies were restricted to breast imaging applications. Frequently reported sources of variability included subject repositioning, tissue changes, and hardware-related factors. Although most studies reported acceptable repeatability, the absence of standardised protocols and metrics limits cross-study comparison and the establishment of benchmarks. The review concludes with recommendations to harmonise approaches that contribute to accelerate the clinical translation of MMWI systems."

    "abstract": "Tabular data have been playing a mostly important role in diverse real-world fields, such as healthcare, engineering, finance, etc. The recent success of deep learning has fostered many deep networks (e.g., Transformer, ResNet) based tabular learning methods. Generally, existing deep tabular machine learning methods are along with the two paradigms, i.e., inlearning and pre-learning. In-learning methods need to train networks from scratch or impose extra constraints to regulate the representations which nonetheless train multiple tasks simultaneously and make learning more difficult, while prelearning methods design several pretext tasks for pre-training and then conduct task-specific fine-tuning, which however need much extra training effort with prior knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep Tabular Representation Corrector, TRC, to enhance any trained deep tabular model's representations without altering its parameters in a model-agnostic manner. Specifically, targeting the representation shift and representation redundancy that hinder prediction, we propose two tasks, i.e., (i) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Tabular Representation Re-estimation</i>, that involves training a shift estimator to calculate the inherent shift of tabular representations to subsequently mitigate it, thereby re-estimating the representations and (ii) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Tabular Space Mapping</i>, that transforms the above re-estimated representations into a light-embedding vector space via a coordinate estimator while preserves crucial predictive information to minimize redundancy. The two tasks jointly enhance the representations of deep tabular models without touching on the original models thus enjoying high efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art deep tabular machine learning models coupled with TRC on various tabular benchmarks which have shown consistent superiority."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs), as crucial components of online services, can help users efficiently obtain information they may like. In reality, RSs face long-term threats. Attackers manipulate recommendation results by injecting malicious data in order to obtain benefits. At present, research on the security of RSs lacks a comprehensive understanding of attack capabilities. Moreover, existing defense strategies have not yet been systematically associated with attack characteristics. More importantly, existing defense methods rarely focus on real unlabeled data in practical application scenarios for anomaly detection and forensics. Therefore, this survey systematically analyzes the security of RSs and provides new insights. Specifically, we first categorize attack models from an attack perspective into: attack strategies based on targets, attack strategies against security and privacy, attack strategies based on prior knowledge, and attack strategies against other RSs. From a perspective of defense, existing detection models, second, can be divided into: behavioral representation based on statistics, detection based on hidden features, detection against privacy attacks, anomaly discovery based on association mining, and abnormality forensics for real-world data. Finally, we propose several potential research directions aimed at providing guidance for the security research of RSs. Additionally, to facilitate experimental reproducibility and comparative research, this survey also provides a repository of resources for attacks and defenses (<uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://github.com/xiaofengbbb/RS-Papers</uri>)."

Given the stringent power constraints in satellite systems, especially in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, energy efficiency becomes a critical design requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel design for energy-efficient holographic metasurface-based modulation and beamforming for LEO satellite communication. Our approach employs a single radio frequency (RF) chain, significantly reducing power consumption compared to the conventional MIMO scheme while maintaining communication performance. To address the Lorentzian constraints inherent in holographic metasurfaces due to their magnetic polarizability, we introduce a beamforming strategy that effectively mitigates the impact of these physical limitations. Simulation results show that our proposed system achieves significant energy efficiency improvements over conventional fully digital and existing holographic beamforming architectures, with only a small trade-off in achievable data rate."

    "abstract": "Through the utilization of machine learning, this research endeavors to examine the modeling of evolutionary processes that occur inside biological systems at the same time. After initially concentrating on artificial genetics methods, the methodology eventually develops into a framework that is more scalable and predictive. This framework makes use of a collection of models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, and Neural Networks, in order to evaluate genetic datasets that are derived from the actual world. With the use of genetic characteristics and environmental circumstances, these models attempt to forecast the results of evolutionary processes. There is a substantial focus put on performance evaluation, which makes use of a variety of measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices. A better understanding of the performance of the model and the patterns in its evolution may be achieved via the application of visualization tools. The Random Forest algorithm comes out as the most successful among the models that were evaluated. It achieves a high level of accuracy and provides reliable predictions over a wide range of biological datasets. The work that has been done here establishes the framework for future advances, such as the incorporation of deeper learning models, the utilization of bigger datasets, and the possibility of real-time processing of evolutionary trend forecasts."

Hybrid converter topologies have gained significant attention in addressing these challenges. This paper comprehensively reviews recent hybrid input converter architectures for battery charging applications. Key attributes, such as isolation, power flow management between the grid, PV, and EV, and the number of passive components and switching devices, are critically analysed.

We innovated on the collection of trace data and improved several coverage mechanisms. With our efforts, LLVM-Cov achieves a robust mapping of coverage to the source code with the support of compiler optimizations, measuring line, branch, and MC/DC coverage. We present the first comprehensive coverage results (including MC/DC) for the Linux kernel. The MC/DC coverage using the current Linux test suites is low (7 %). By contributing our work back to the open-source community, we enable test suites to be enhanced to improve MC/DC coverage over time. Moreover, we describe DO-330 qualification. We certified our usage of LLVM-Cov to meet Criterion 3 of the tool impact criteria in DO-178C §12.2.2. at a Tool Qualification Level of 5.

Traditional fault diagnosis methods often struggle with accurate and rapid fault detection. This paper proposes an advanced approach combining Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) for detailed signal analysis and the Random Forest machine learning classifier for accurate fault detection and classification. The proposed method efficiently identifies subtle faults in PV arrays by analyzing both high and low-frequency components of the system’s signal at multiple levels.

Our evaluation shows that, under replay attacks, the attacker's signal can overpower legitimate transmissions, leading to a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) difference of up to -7.8 dB during reentry and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$-6.5 \\mathbf{~ d B}$</tex> during launch. To mitigate these threats, we propose a more secure receiver design incorporating a phase-coherencydependent decision-directed (DD) equalizer with a narrowed phase-locked loop (PLL) bandwidth. This configuration enhances resilience by making synchronization more sensitive to phase distortions caused by replay interference."

Collision risk for an airspace is required to meet a Target Level of Safety (TLS) such as 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−9</sup>. Collision Risk Models (CRM) for airspace operations use pairs of flight tracks for the proposed airspace procedures to assess the Actual Level of Safety (ALS). Since airborne collisions are rare events, a large number of pairs of flight tracks are required (e.g. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\times 10^{7}$</tex>) to achieve a reasonable confidence interval. Researchers have recently developed AI algorithms capable of generating flight tracks, known as synthetic flight tracks. One question that must be answered before the pairs of synthetic flight tracks can be used in the collision risk analysis, is do the synthetic flight tracks represent realistic aerodynamics? This paper describes “physics-based” realism checks for individual synthetic flight tracks to ensure that they abide by fixed wing aerodynamic properties. Metrics for the lateral profile and vertical profile are described. The metrics are demonstrated with a case study. Implications of these methods, limitations and future work are discussed."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of wireless devices and the ever-growing demands for multimedia applications have resulted in bandwidth shortage and are putting a massive strain on the network resources. To overcome these shortcomings, semantic communication has come to the forefront, where only the important data features can be transmitted instead of the conventional bit-level transmission, thereby saving bandwidth and resources and achieving sustainability. Depending on the application and data, semantic features can be extracted with the help of deep learning (DL) techniques and embedded into the transmitted data. At the receiver end, the semantic features can be extracted to recover the original data or utilized to perform specific tasks. However, semantic communication research remains in its nascent stages, for which an exhaustive literature review has been presented in this domain, and the deep learning architectures employed for capturing semantics, along with the associated performance metrics, have been elaborated upon."

A piezoelectric multilayer structure is generally used in these devices which are composed of a two-layer piezoelectric structure with a passive layer in between the two piezoelectric layers. It is a multilayer aspect paired with mass component and a coupling mechanism that circulates the mechanical vibration generated in the piezoelectric layers to the skull associated with the user. Standard designs however have the transducer placed directly on the skin of the head hence the skin gets irritated or eroded and are therefore not useful in rare instances of long term use. Hearing implants Bone conduction hearing implants and active middle ear implants avoid these problems, but they require surgical implantation that can result in skin complications. With this study, the researcher focused on developing a new type of hearing aid based on bone conduction where the hearing aid does not require surgical interventions and does not place pressure on the skin. The novel method entails substituting a portion of the conventional piezoelectric device special electrode with pinna skin and, therefore, changing the piezoelectric product in a special and less intrusive manner."

The performance of the system is measured in terms of outage probability using the log-normal fading channel model. We also elaborate on the power distribution optimization between the relay and destination nodes in the FD-NOMA case for minimization of outage probability.

Researchers have effectively replicated and utilized these designs, leading to significant advancements in various scientific fields. The elytra of beetles, for example, display outstanding mechanical strength, effectively protecting the soft tissues underneath from potential damage in their natural environments. Despite being composed of relatively common materials, the remarkable mechanical properties of beetle elytra can be attributed to their hierarchical, layered structure. This study focuses on the Sagra femorata purpurea Lichtenstein beetle, employing biomimetic modeling techniques to construct four layered models with interlayer angles of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$90^{\\circ}, 60^{\\circ}$</tex>, and 0° for parallel bottom plates, as well as 0° for vertical bottom plates. A series of experiments and numerical simulations were conducted on these models to analyze the effects of varying fiber block orientations across the layers on the mechanical behavior of these multi-layered structures. The findings show that the structure with 0° parallel bottom plates demonstrates superior mechanical properties compared to other configurations, while the structure with 0° vertical bottom plates shows relatively lower performance. However, considering the multi-directional impact forces beetles endure in their natural environments, the configuration with a 60° interlayer angle offers superior overall performance in terms of multi-directional impact resistance."

Therefore, maintaining Round-the-Clock (RTC) energy availability is eminent while shifting to Hydrogen Electrolyzers (HE) based HCIs powered by variable grids. However, relying on RTC supply from the grid may increase emissions and costs, affecting economics and sustainability. Besides under the current regulations, HCIs must follow Renewable energy (RE) temporal correlations to ensure the hydrogen produced is green. Thus, effective HE operations with suitable HE technology are critical for HCIs with constrained downstream operations. Hydrogen storage (HS) may facilitate partial hydrogen supply for HCIs and ensure RE accommodation at peak times. However, this cannot be accomplished without appropriate operational flexibility in HEs acting as the core for sustainable hydrogen adoption, enabling dynamic load management to align production with fluctuating RE. This well-articulated study advocates the role of model fidelity and operational flexibility in sustainable HCI operations under rigid downstream operations. The proposed aspects enhance compliance with regulations and targets, adjust electricity demand, and minimize grid stress and curtailments. This synergistic approach ensures a path toward decarbonized industrial processes.

It enables attackers to inject harmful scripts into trusted sites that compromise sensitive user data and system integrity. The primary objective of our work is to classify cross-scripting attacks to enhance web security. This proposed approach categorizes the XSS attacks into three types of payloads: reflected, stored, and DOM-based. Each entry contains an encoded URL or script that exploits a weakness in web applications. A benchmark dataset is accessed from the IEEE Dataport repository to train, test, and performance analysis of the model. As per the earlier study, the machine learning model plays a crucial role in XSS attack detection and classification. However, these models lack in terms of proper feature selection techniques. So in this research, we have applied the widely used ML algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision tree, Support vector classifier, KNN, and Naive Bayes approach, along with the most preferred feature selection techniques to design the model. The model outcome shows that Random Forest’s testing accuracy is 0.9908 without feature selection. Accordingly, using feature selection techniques for Random Forest, the SelectKBest Chi<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> method achieved an accuracy of 0.8933, while SelectKBest Mutual Information reached 0.9167. Using the wrapper-based approach (RFE), the highest accuracy was 0.9789 with Random Forest, followed by KNN with 0.9433. Then the embedded method resulted in an accuracy of 0.9100. Though the Random Forest model without using feature selection holds the highest testing accuracy, it is suspected to be overfitting. Therefore, feature selection methods are utilized to minimize overfitting and increase the ability of the model to generalize. Therefore, in this research work, we have primarily focused on the feature selection techniques to mitigate this issue."

Experimental results demonstrated that larger cells (average equivalent spherical diameter, ESD <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8.45 \\mu ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex>) experienced stronger dielectrophoretic forces. After being captured by the light patterns, they were able to move following the displacement of the light patterns. In contrast, smaller cells (ESD <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6.72 \\mu ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex>) experienced weaker dielectrophoretic forces. After being captured by the light patterns, their movement speed lagged behind the moving speed of the light patterns. Ultimately, the differing dielectrophoretic forces resulted in the gradual separation of cells by size. Compared to traditional physical channels or fluorescence labeling methods, this approach avoids chemical damage and allows real-time adjustment of channel parameters. The study confirms the high sensitivity and reliability of ODEP virtual channel technology in eukaryotic microorganism sorting, providing a versatile platform for single-cell analysis."

By constructing a quantitative framework including data processing, time series prediction, strategy implementation and back testing evaluation, the BiLSTM-Attention model is used to capture the long-term time series dependence of Kweichow Moutai (600519) stock price, and generate price prediction signals for future trading days; It also designs a composite signal system, integrates RSI, MACD, volatility indicators and dynamic position management module, introduces multiple risk barriers, index gradient position adding mechanism and sliding window profit and loss stop strategy, and realizes risk adaptive control. The results of the back test show that in the extreme market from June to September 2024, the traditional Martingale Strategy has suffered a large loss, while the improved Martingale Strategy has avoided the loss caused by large-scale overweight by virtue of multi-dimensional technical indicators. The improved Martingale Strategy significantly reduces the loss risk in the trend market by filtering invalid signals through technical indicators, adjusting position size through volatility and active profit and loss stop mechanism, and verifies the effectiveness of the collaborative optimization of the deep learning model and traditional trading strategies. This framework provides an extensible technical path for low-frequency quantitative trading, and is suitable for personal lightweight financial product development."

The transformer is subjected to multiple stresses, such as thermal, electrical, ambient, etc., leading to degradation of the insulation, causing sudden failures. It is really quite difficult to estimate the real age or real life of the transformers. In the present paper, a novel technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is used to estimate the remaining life of the high-voltage power transformers. This method focused on calculating the percentage of available degradation and corresponding to its ranking. The proposed method is validated with 9 diagnostics attributes that significantly affect the life of the transformers that have been taken into consideration. Onfiled data collected from 15 transformers with their pre-known age taken from Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board, India, is used. All the data is normalized within a linear range to maintain consistency and comparability. The proposed approach successfully addresses all the limitations of traditional estimated methods. The proposed method introduced the new basement for life estimation of transformers. This technique is beneficial for diagnostic experts and the power industry for properly estimating the life of the transformers. This work is beneficial for timely taking decisions on maintenance, management and replacement of the asset."

Subsequently, wavelet transform is applied to extract time-frequency features, and the Fisher discriminant ratio is employed again to optimize the selection to 30 optimal channels. Results demonstrate that the selected channels are primarily distributed in frontal and temporal lobes, with significant differences between groups observed in theta band energy mean and complexity mean. Classification using these two features achieves an accuracy of 74.3%. These findings are consistent with neuropathological research and show promising clinical application potential. This study validates the effectiveness of the multi-scale MEG channel selection strategy and provides new insights for constructing lightweight objective assessment models."

In the task research, this paper introduces two algorithms: one is the improved depth-first search algorithm (IDFS), which is used to optimize the path selection; The other is adaptive reinforcement Learning (AER) for real-time decision support. By combining these two algorithms, a new cooperative optimization algorithm (CAO) is generated, which shows significant performance improvement in solving real supply chain problems.

These oscillations can significantly affect the stability and safety of WPP, especially in Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) systems. This paper explores DFIG WES and reviews traditional SSO mitigation techniques that use Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers. It also introduces a novel supplementary damping controller with rotor speed as its control input. Time-domain simulations evaluated the performance and limitations of these mitigation techniques. The analysis revealed a need for a more effective solution, leading to the application of a Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm to optimise the parameters of the controllers within a DFIG framework. Results from the optimized system show substantial improvement in SSO damping across various wind speeds and compensation levels, providing a more effective approach to SSO mitigation. The study uses the IEEE First Benchmark Model integrated with a DFIG-based WES to investigate these dynamics."

    "abstract": "These days, the increasing prevalence of internet threats such as phishing, spam, dangerous intent, fraud, and other related threats have posed many risks to individuals and organizations across the world. Previous research in this scope primarily focused on rule-based or keyword-driven approaches, which were mostly limited to single-language datasets and lacked the adaptability required for multilingual contexts. The need of detecting these messages multilingually arises from the growing number of digital dangers. This paper explores the use of LLM (Large Language Models), for identifying potentially suspicious content across multiple language contexts. MBERT model utilizes a transformer-based bidirectional attention mechanism to extract the meaning of words in multilingual messages and offers reliable detection of risks across diverse languages. Flan-T5 is fine-tuned using a broad set of task-specific instructions, improving its performance on unseen tasks. Moreover, approaches like zero-shot learning allow the system to get used to work on/adapt to different languages, on which it is not trained. Both our models show promising results with synthetic multilingual datasets. The overall accuracies are 82.3% and 83.33% for MBERT and Flan T5 respectively. The results obtained are helpful in dealing with messages involving cyber threats."

    "abstract": "The proposed work presents a technique to enhance the stability in the ego vehicle, that has advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features deployed on board, from an estimation of the attitude parameters of target vehicles derived from LiDaR data measurements. The method addresses the important problem of crashes in the context of adverse road conditions when vehicles are part of a convoy, with adaptive cruise control (ACC) enabled as part of ADAS functionality. It uses LiDaR point cloud data (PCD) for tracking and detection of vehicles, and to estimate the attitude parameters (roll, pitch, yaw), and the longitudinal, lateral and rotational velocities in the scenario of sub-optimal terrain conditions. A VoxelNet algorithm for 3D object detection is used, followed by a Kalman filter for robust tracking. Attitude estimation is done by deriving the Eulerian attitude angles from a decomposition-based rotation matrix. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of this approach in different driving conditions associated with ACC, such as straight and turn sections of roads, and unevenly paved road conditions. The system exhibits robust real-time performance in tracking, detection and attitude estimation of vehicles, with potential improvements towards more robust ADAS use cases while also minimizing road accidents due to adverse road and driving conditions."

    "abstract": "As the electricity market transitions from a traditional planned economy model to a market-oriented operation, the competition mechanisms, transaction rules, and regulatory systems are encountering significant challenges and opportunities. In particular, power generation companies serve as key players within this market, making the rational utilization of their market power and effective oversight especially critical. The current structure of the electricity market often reflects characteristics of oligopoly, with a limited number of large power generation companies dominating market supply. These companies wield considerable influence and authority due to their scale, capital, and technological advantages. However, such a market structure can also facilitate the potential abuse of market power, which can adversely affect fair competition and the optimal allocation of resources. This article aims to explore a method for identifying the market power of oligopolistic power generation enterprises through the lens of game theory. This method effectively assesses market entities by constructing a bidding strategy model tailored for power generation enterprises operating within a regional oligopoly, alongside an index system for identifying abusive market power behaviors. Ultimately, this approach seeks to accurately determine the extent of market power to foster fair competition and promote the healthy development of the power market."

    "abstract": "The efficient performance of an electric power train primarily depends on motors and their control. Currently, permanent magnet synchronous motors are the preferred choice for electric propulsion due to their high efficiency. In contrast, synchronous reluctance motors are constructed without rare earth permanent magnets, making them a cost-effective alternative for traction applications. However, synchronous reluctance motors experience significant torque ripple due to their anisotropic rotor structure and nonlinear magnetic characteristics. Structural modifications and advanced controllers are typically employed to mitigate torque ripple. This paper proposes different methods to reduce the torque ripple in synchronous reluctance motor drives. One approach involves modifying the rotor configuration to decrease the torque ripple within the motor itself. Another method consists of applying field-oriented control strategy and maximum torque per ampere with field-oriented control to the synchronous reluctance motor drive to minimize torque ripple. Simulation results indicate a substantial reduction in torque ripple. Overall, the proposed methods enhance the feasibility of synchronous reluctance motors for next-generation electric vehicle propulsion systems."

To address this, we propose a Latency-Aware Gated Cascade (LAGC) mechanism, which optimizes the accuracy and inference speed trade-off through a routing policy and a fusion strategy between CNN and Transformer models. On a synthetic dataset, the LAGC achieves 96.8% accuracy, close to the Transformer's 97.2 %, but with a much faster inference time of 0.42 ms, a 42 % reduction. The LAGC is significantly more accurate than the CNN's 91.8 %, while only being slower by 0.03 ms, showing a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency."

    "abstract": "In traffic scene object detection, edge devices are limited by storage and computing resources. Traditional AlexNet models suffer from parameter redundancy and high computational complexity, resulting in insufficient real-time performance and difficulty meeting deployment requirements. Among existing lightweight methods, static quantization easily causes feature distortion due to fixed thresholds, while random pruning may damage key feature channels. Neither can balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight model, Mini-AlexNet, based on quantization and pruning. The model achieves lightweight through collaborative optimization of dynamic quantization and structured pruning: Dynamic quantization adjusts quantization parameters (scaling factors and zeros) in real-time during inference, compressing 32-bit floating-point parameters into 8-bit integers to reduce storage requirements. Structured pruning screens redundant channels based on the gamma values of BN layers, removing filters with weak responses to non-critical features in traffic scenes (with a pruning ratio of 30%) while maintaining the consistency of residual connections to avoid topological damage. Experimental results show that the size of Mini-AlexNet is reduced to 39.5 MB (an 83.3% compression), computational complexity is decreased by $\\mathbf{7 8. 2 \\%} \\boldsymbol{(} \\mathbf{0. 3 1 G}$ FLOPs), and the frames per second (FPS) is increased to 11.2. Meanwhile, it maintains detection accuracy for core targets such as vehicles and pedestrians. Visualization results indicate more concentrated confidence and fewer redundant annotations.

    "abstract": "In modern industrial production, robots and intelligent equipment continuously generate massive time series data, making timely detection of anomalous patterns crucial for ensuring equipment safety and production efficiency. However, industrial scenarios face challenges including scarcity of anomalous samples, diverse and complex anomaly patterns, and strict real-time requirements, while existing deep learning methods still exhibit limitations in handling long-range dependencies and parallel computation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes TOCA (Transformer-Based Contrastive One-Class Time Series Anomaly Detection), a Transformer-based sequential contrastive learning model. The model innovatively integrates Transformers into the sequential contrastive learning framework, employing a multi-layer convolutional feature encoder to extract original representations, utilizing Transformer networks to model global dependencies for generating reconstructed representations, and designing a sequential contrastive learning module to achieve negative-sample-free contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate that TOCA achieves RPA F1 scores of 41.67% and 57.55% on IOpsCompetition and UCR datasets respectively, and 65.27% on real industrial robot datasets, significantly outperforming existing baseline models and validating the model’s effectiveness and practicality in industrial anomaly detection tasks."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target detection faces critical challenges in identifying small, dense targets within complex aerial environments. The current YOLO architecture has problems with extracting features at different scales, using dynamic attention mechanisms, and combining features in a way that adapts to the needs of unmanned aerial vehicles. This paper introduces HBM-YOLO, an improved detection framework that solves these problems with three new architectural ideas that work together. The hierarchical grouping enhancement C3k2 (HGE_C3k2) module uses multi-scale convolution and smart channel partitioning instead of the standard C3k2 component to better capture different spatial patterns. Second, the convolutional Double-layer Routing Attention (C2BRA) mechanism takes the place of the C2PSA component. It adds hierarchical attention paths so that selective feature aggregation can happen in the top-k region while using less computing power. Third, the Hybrid Aggregation Network (MANet) takes the place of the C3k2 module in the detection head. It does this by using multipath processing and residual refinement to adaptively fuse features. Comprehensive tests on VisDrone-DET2019 showed that HBMYOLO did very well: mAP @ 0.5 reached 35.4%, and $\\mathrm{mAP} \\text{@} 0.5: 0.95$ reached 20.7%. These were 2.2% and 1.4% higher than the baseline YOLOv11n, respectively. This framework has set a new standard for finding targets with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It solves problems like changes in scale, limited computing power, and how to represent features in real-time aerial environments."

This research demonstrates a deep learning-based approach to identify and categorize the footprints of several animal species, including raccoons, dogs, horses, bears, and rats. This technique uses strong CNNs with deep learning architectures to extract the characteristics of an animal's footprints. To make the system robust to a variety of real-world scenarios, training is done using a tagged and preprocessed image dataset.

A hierarchical search algorithm is employed for the optimal estimation of the OIRS orientation, followed by a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) based fingerprinting method for position inference.

    "abstract": "Personalized recommendation models are often constrained by data sparsity and model complexity, which limits the discovery of users’ latent preferences. To address this issue, a multi-dimensional collaborative recommendation model based on an implicit trust network is proposed. Multi-dimensional user profiles are constructed by integrating user attributes and spatial-geographical features. Preference correlations between users are quantified using cosine similarity, and significantly correlated nodes are identified through dynamic thresholding to construct an implicit trust network based on potential preferences. The Louvain algorithm is then employed to perform hierarchical community partitioning of the implicit trust network, where the modularity index is iteratively optimized to form highly cohesive sub-communities, thereby reducing the temporal and spatial complexity of global similarity computation. Within each sub-community, a temporal penalty mechanism and an item popularity penalty term are further incorporated to suppress popularity bias and improve robustness. Experimental results on the MovieLens 1 M dataset indicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of MAE, RMSE, accuracy, recall, and $\\mathbf{F 1}$ score, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness."

This study explores the effects of wildfire-induced soiling on solar energy output using a combined modeling approach. Linear regression is used to establish baseline relationships, while an artificial neural network model is used to enhance prediction accuracy by addressing nonlinear environmental effects. Data collected during a 51-day study period, including a 7-day wildfire-affected period, are analyzed to evaluate the regression and neural network models' performance under varying environmental conditions. Results show that the artificial neural network model consistently achieves lower prediction errors and higher accuracy compared to regression alone, particularly during wildfire periods where environmental variability is highest. The findings demonstrate the importance of addressing soiling and dynamic environmental factors in photovoltaic performance forecasting. This research provides valuable insights for improving the reliability of solar power systems in regions prone to extreme weather events, supporting energy resilience in wildfire-prone regions."

Mixed Reality offers an interactive space that combines physical and digital spaces together. This paper describes a mixed reality application aimed at enhancing surgical preplanning by offering a fast and reliable framework for visualizing patient anatomies for medical professionals. The application enables multiple users to interact with a 3D anatomical model in a collaborative setup. Users can manipulate the 3D model through intuitive hand gestures (scaling, rotation, and translation), ensuring that all collaborators share a consistent view of the model’s transformations in both time and space. The application is developed for Microsoft Hololens 2, using Unity, Vuforia, and the Mixed Reality Toolkit, it relies on marker-based tracking for the precise registration of 3D anatomical models in the real-world environment. The application creates an immersive and interactive environment for the user to gain a better understanding of the complex anatomical structures. The reliability of marker-based tracking was evaluated by measuring translation error, rotation error, and the latency between marker recognition and model deployment. A negligible delay of less than 0.05 seconds was observed for the model to achieve a state of zero translation and rotation error. The results reveal that marker-based tracking has the potential to ensure consistency in the deployment of models during surgical planning and decision-making workflows."

    "abstract": "Compression models have gained popularity in recent years as method of increasing the efficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs) deployed on edge devices. However, the compression process may increase misclassification risks and impair model accuracy. As a result, how to efficiently find and rectify faults in compressed models with limited resources has become an essential topic that must be addressed. This study provides a test prioritization strategy for compressed classification models with the goal of prioritizing the discovery of test samples that are more likely to be misclassified by compressed models, hence enhancing model performance while reducing overall label costs. To capture the behavioral shifts caused by compression, this method initially constructs intrinsic attributes based on the prediction disparities between the compressed model and the original model, as well as the embedded features of the input instances. A graph neural network is subsequently introduced to derive the neighborhood structural features of each test sample, reflecting its structural association with known error samples in the feature space, by constructing a similarity graph between training data and test data. Ultimately, the two kinds of features are combined, and a neural network is employed to forecast the misclassification probability of the test samples, thereby achieving ranking. Empirical research indicates that the method outlined in this paper can significantly enhance the accuracy and adversarial robustness of compressed models following retraining with restricted samples, and it surpasses the performance of current general test ranking methods. The results substantiate the potential of compressed model test ranking methods to enhance model performance and decrease the cost of manual annotation."

However, training neural networks relies on large, diverse datasets that are often unavailable in aviation. Vision-language foundation models offer a promising alternative, but their accuracy for aviation tasks is an open question as the aerial perspective might not be adequately represented in the original training data. Against this background, this paper investigates the performance of two vision-language foundation models, CLIPSeg and CAT-Seg, on an aerial image dataset. Our experiments show that the models can achieve competitive semantic segmentation performance without aviation-specific training. This paper further examines prompt engineering and discusses challenges of deploying these models in aviation. While certification and runtime constraints pose significant hurdles, our findings suggest that vision-language foundation models have potential for improving environment perception in aviation and may reduce the need for extensive training data in the future."

    "abstract": "Induction machines are increasingly being adopted for automotive applications as a competitive alternative to permanent magnet motors, emphasizing the need for reliable and safe operation. The significance of online condition monitoring is driven by the challenges posed by motor faults, which can result in significant downtime, maintenance costs, and revenue losses. However, a major obstacle in fault detection is the absence of an accurate analytical model to characterize faulty motors. With the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) across various industries, AI-based techniques have emerged as powerful tools for improving electric motor performance, particularly in fault detection and diagnosis. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent trends of AI applications in induction machine drive, with a specific focus on early fault detection for automotive applications."

This study optimizes hydrogen supply chains by allocating hydrogen production plants to 12 fueling stations in France. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model with constraints on plant capacity, station demand, and transportation costs. Three solvers—Gurobi, Scipy, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)—are compared. While Gurobi produces a suboptimal solution due to the non-convex nature of the problem, Scipy and PSO obtained nearoptimal solutions with significantly lower costs compared to Gurobi. However, Scipy struggles with multi-plant allocation scenarios. PSO is therefore selected for its scalability and robust performance. The study examines three scenarios with two, three, and four production plants to minimize total costs. The results show that deploying four plants achieves the lowest cost of $138 million by reducing transportation distances and balancing installation expenses. Future work will explore dynamic plant allocation, real-time demand integration, and uncertainty modeling to enhance scalability and practical applicability."

To address these challenges, the Higher Airspace Operations concept has been introduced to allow decentralized traffic management, in which vehicle operators can cooperatively maintain safe separation through strategic conflict negotiation. Our paper introduces an enhanced multi-party negotiation model that shifts from resolving each conflict within the scenario sequentially to simultaneous conflict resolution. The model enables multiple operators to concurrently propose and respond to maneuvers using a multithreading technique. Automating this process reduces the biases and delays associated with manual coordination, which ensures rapid and reliable conflict resolution. We implement and simulate a scenario involving three aircraft with overlapping conflicts to illustrate how the system achieves valid, conflict-free outcomes over multiple negotiation rounds.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) serve as a firstline defense mechanism to detect and identify various cyber threats. However, traditional IDSs frameworks come with their own challenges, such as high computational costs, limited generalization to evolving variants of cyberattacks, increasing complexity, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a meta-learning-based IDS framework using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to particularly combat adversarial attacks in IoT networks. The designed architecture optimizes model initialization by performing inner-loop updates using adversarially perturbed data. It aggregates gradients from these adversarially adapted models in the outer loop to achieve a resilient initialization that generalizes well against adversarial attacks. The proposed approach is rigorously evaluated by training and testing the model on three major adversarial attacks: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and DeepFool. The experimental outcomes indicate the promising performance of the proposed architecture with an average attack detection accuracy of 95.97%. The compact model size of 0.06MB makes it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices and networks. Furthermore, the lower inferencing time ensures the timely detection of intrusion, which is significant for real-time IDSs."

The results show that XLNet outperforms BERT-base-cased and RoBERTa when evaluating models using F1score, recall, accuracy, and precision. The results demonstrate that XLNet achieves superior performance in contextual sentiment recognition because it delivers 99.62% classification accuracy.

The computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture addresses this challenge by performing computations directly within the memory array, reducing data transfer between the processor and memory. This paper introduces a Booth algorithm-based In-MRAM computing architecture (BaM-CIM) using a hybrid voltage-gated spin-orbit torque MTJ (VGSOT-MTJ) and gate-all-around carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (GAA-CNTFETs) for efficient multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) computing. The key contributions of BaM-CIM are as follows: 1) A Voltage divider reference (VDR) cell is proposed, which enables read operations using only a 2T1M cell structure. Compared to complementary read cells, the VDR reduces the area by half and achieves robust data sensing without requiring precharge/discharge operations. 2) The BaM-CIM circuit is proposed to complete 8b-W/8b-IN/21b-OUT computations in only two cycles (1.6 ns), reducing the number of cycles by 75% compared to single-bit input serial operations and by 50% compared to two-bit serial operations. 3) A three-input 8b Booth computing adder (BCA), along with Modified computing shift adder (MCSA) and Modified computing post adder (MCPA), which can achieve higher energy efficiency.

Existing spherical-wavefront model based Methods face two primary drawbacks. First, their underlying assumptions are often invalid in complex real-world scenarios, particularly under Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions. This leads to inaccurate channel parameter estimation and subsequent errors in localization and environmental sensing. Second, they necessitate costly and complex MIMO systems, rendering them impractical for many deployments constrained by budget or hardware. Our proposed method directly addresses these limitations. Our proposed method directly addresses these limitations. It incorporates novel two-step suppression framework of clusters acquisition and preferred expected cluster selection to effectively eliminates the errors caused by non-conforming MPCs, thereby improving the accuracy of both localization and environmental sensing. Crucially, the system only requires a multi-antenna setup at one end, significantly reducing complexity and cost. Additionally, an iterative procedure is embedded in the method to enhance computational efficiency. Through indoor simulations and measurements in various LoS and NLoS scenarios, our method consistently demonstrates higher target localization accuracy and better environmental sensing than comparable benchmarks. This confirms that our solution is not only more robust and widely applicable but also maintains a high level of computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose major challenges due to their stealthy and adaptive behavior. Traditional detection methods based on signatures or heuristics are limited in identifying novel and evolving attacks, while static deep learning models suffer from concept drift and catastrophic forgetting, leading to degraded performance over time. This paper proposes an adaptive APT detection framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with rehearsal-based continual learning using telemetry data from Wazuh, an open-source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platform. Endpoint telemetry is represented as graphs where nodes denote system components and edges describe behavioral interactions among them. Experimental evaluations on real-world Wazuh telemetry augmented with sandbox-executed APT scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves F1-scores above 0.98, outperforming static and fine-tuned baselines in both adaptability and knowledge retention. These results confirm that combining graph-based representations with continual learning offers a scalable, interpretable, and resilient solution for modern SOC and EDR environments facing advanced and evolving cyber threats."

    "abstract": "Emotional artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance personalization in computational social systems by enabling machines to respond to users’ affective states. In education, adapting instruction based on emotions such as engagement and stress may lead to more supportive learning experiences. This study examines whether an emotionally adaptive social robot, driven by real-time electroencephalography (EEG) signals, can improve learners’ engagement and perception of the robot. A between-subjects experiment is conducted with 30 undergraduate students during an XML lecture delivered by the Furhat social robot in one-to-one modality. In the empathetic condition, the robot adapts its behavior in response to EEG-detected engagement and stress levels; in the nonempathetic condition, the robot follows a fixed script. The empathetic robot significantly improved users’ perceptions across all Godspeed dimensions and enhanced perceived usability and reward. EEG data showed a significant increase in engagement. Learning outcomes were statistically similar across conditions. Real-time EEG-guided emotional adaptation improves user engagement and perception of social robots in educational contexts. These findings support the role of affect-driven adaptivity in enhancing user experience in intelligent tutoring systems."

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal traffic data imputation is a fundamental component in intelligent transportation systems, which can significantly improve data quality and enhance the accuracy of downstream data mining tasks. Recently, low-rank tensor representation has shown great potential for spatio-temporal traffic data imputation. However, the low-rank assumption focuses on the global structure, neglecting the critical spatial topology and local temporal dependencies inherent in spatio-temporal data. To address these issues, we propose a topology-induced low-rank tensor representation (TILR), which can accurately capture the underlying low-rankness of the spatial multi-scale features induced by topology knowledge. Moreover, to exploit local temporal dependencies, we suggest a learnable convolutional regularization framework, which not only includes some classical convolution-based regularizers but also leads to the discovery of new convolutional regularizers. Equipped with the suggested TILR and convolutional regularizer, we build a unified low-rank tensor model harmonizing spatial topology and temporal dependencies for traffic data imputation, which is expected to deliver promising performance even under extreme and complex missing scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm and analyze its computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for various missing scenarios. These results reveal the critical synergy between topology-aware low-rank constraint and temporal dynamic modeling for spatio-temporal data imputation."

    "abstract": "The explosive growth of data poses significant challenges for GPU-based databases, which must balance limited memory capacity with the need for high-speed query execution. Compression has become an essential technique for optimizing memory utilization and reducing data movement. However, its benefits have been limited to the necessary data decompression. Querying compressed data conventionally requires decompression, which causes the query process to be significantly slower than a direct query on uncompressed data. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel GPU-accelerated tile-based direct query framework that successfully eliminates the limitation, significantly enhancing query performance. By employing direct query strategies, the framework minimizes data movement and maximizes memory bandwidth utilization. It incorporates tilebased hardware-conscious execution strategies for direct query, including memory management and control flow coordination, to improve execution efficiency. Additionally, adaptive data-driven compression formats are paired with tailored SQL operators to enable efficient support for diverse queries. Our experiments, conducted using the Star Schema Benchmark, show an average improvement of 3.5× compared to the state-of-the-art tilebased decompression scheme, while maintaining the space-saving advantages of compression. Notably, our solution consistently outperforms existing direct execution schemes for compressed data across all query types."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of generative AI (Gen AI), e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Newegg are adopting AI-generated summaries (AIGS) to synthesize online reviews. We analytically study the transformative impact of AIGS one commerce with competing retailers by examining its two key effects: the convenience effect, which reduces consumers' reading costs to access review information, and the filtering effect, which aids consumers in making more informed purchase decisions. Retailers differ in their market reputation (MR), and not all consumers in the market trust AIGS. Our findings suggest that the convenience effect and the filtering effect influence competition in opposite ways. When consumer trust in AIGS is high, its adoption may intensify price competition. We further show that moderately high consumer trust in AIGS enables its adoption to create an all-win outcome for both the platform and competing retailers. Surprisingly, we find that while high trust in AIGS can reinforce high-MR retailers' advantages (a Matthew effect), the adoption of AIGS under low trust may instead reshape market competition by narrowing these advantages. Interestingly, when AIGS is fully trusted and adoption costs are moderate, it improves social welfare but may lower consumer surplus due to elevated prices."

Our approach encodes volumetric blocks to capture and differentiate underlying structures. It further incorporates a CLIP Score mechanism, which provides semantic information to the blocks to guide navigation. The navigation is empowered by a reinforcement learning framework that leverage these semantic cues to efficiently search for and identify desired viewpoints that align with the user's intent. The selected viewpoints are evaluated using CLIP Score to ensure that they best reflect the user queries. By automating viewpoint selection, our method improves the efficiency of volumetric data navigation and enhances the interpretability of complex scientific phenomena."

    "abstract": "Magnetic field characterization is an essential process during spacecraft development to ensure magnetic cleanliness and accurate field modeling. Conventional testing approaches often rely on stable geomagnetic conditions and magnetic shielding facilities, which limit testing efficiency and scalability. Model-based interference compensation methods have emerged as an alternative, but their performance typically depends on large training datasets and careful hyperparameter tuning, reducing robustness across varying electromagnetic environments. To address these limitations, this study proposes an independent linear layer model with output channel isolation (ILinear-OCI) for interference magnetic field compensation during spacecraft magnetic testing in geomagnetic environments. The developed method achieves decoupled linear transformations across output channels through an innovative output-channel independent prediction mechanism while maintaining multi-channel input compatibility. By integrating linear layers with least squares optimization, the proposed approach enables rapid interference prediction without requiring extensive training datasets or hyperparameter tuning. Experiments for spacecraft magnetic moment modeling demonstrate that the model achieves a mean root mean square error of 0.38 nT between predicted and measured interference fields, reducing magnetic dipole moment modeling errors from 30.45% to 0.62%. In single-device magnetic field measurement trials, the average discrepancy between model outputs and baseline measurements in the near-zero magnetic environment reaches merely 0.33 nT. Furthermore, the model effectively suppress low-frequency geomagnetic noise (power spectral density reduced from 268.83 to 0.83 nT/√Hz at 0.01 Hz) while effectively mitigating interference from electrical equipment and the power line."

    "abstract": "The concept of directly recirculating fusion machine exhaust gas, bypassing the tritium plant, to make fuel pellets was proposed in the 1990s and later termed direct internal recycling (DIR). In the DIR concept, the residual fusion fuel in the machine exhaust stream is separated from impurities locally and diverted directly to the fueling systems, bypassing isotopic separation and other processing equipment, and therefore significantly reducing the required size of the fuel processing plant, reducing plant inventory, and thus increasing the economic viability of fusion as an energy source. One concept for DIR consists of a series of cryogenic pumps to separate the impurities from the machine exhaust gas using different triple point temperatures and saturation curves of exhaust constituents. In this concept, the plasma exhaust is initially passed through an impurity trap operating at ~25–30 K to desublimate impurities such as hydrocarbons, argon, oxygen, and nitrogen. The resulting process stream will consist of DT fuel and helium. The process stream is then pumped by a continuous cryopump known as a “snail pump.” This pump is a steady-state continuous cryopump that desublimates all remaining exhaust gas constituents while allowing helium, a byproduct of the fusion reaction, to pass through. The helium is pumped to the tritium plant for processing while the desublimated material is continuously scraped off, heated up, and transported to the fueling system. This article will present the cryogenic DIR concept and outline the design and operation of the snail pump, along with results from preliminary testing. Tests to assess pumping and separation efficiency found that at D<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> flows below 50.7 Pa <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\cdot $</tex-math> </inline-formula> m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>/s with 1% helium, the pump is capable of pumping and separating the gas with a resulting DIR fraction of >99%, with no helium entrained in the primary fuel exhaust stream. The main limitation is due to the thermal performance of the cryogenic circuits of the pump, which will be addressed in future testing."

This paper proposes a reactive power scheduling strategy based on the Multi-Objective Atomic Orbital Search (MOAOS) algorithm, alongside the Multi-Objective Dragonfly Algorithm (MODA), targeting the simultaneous minimization of Active Power Loss (APL) and Voltage Deviation (VD) within a pool-based electricity market framework. The IEEE 30-bus test system is used to validate the suggested methodology. Simulation results demonstrate that MOAOS achieves a $\\mathbf{3 6 . 1 \\%}$ reduction in APL and an $88.8 \\%$ reduction in VD compared to the initial system conditions. Comparative evaluations with results reported in existing literature confirm the superior performance of the proposed algorithms, especially MOAOS, in terms of solution quality and rate of convergence. The findings highlight that integrating demand-side market participation significantly expands the Pareto-optimal solution space, enhancing flexibility for system operators to prioritize operational or economic objectives dynamically. Overall, the proposed method offers a robust and efficient tool for improving grid stability and economic efficiency in market-driven power systems."

Currently, there is a lack of a detailed and comprehensive system or mechanism for investigating high-speed droplet collisions, which poses a challenge in addressing droplet collision issues encountered in practical engineering applications. In this study, we introduce a collision platform driven by a Superwetting wedge structure to examine the deformation process of droplets post-collision. We have devised three distinct wedge-shaped structures, leveraging the wettability gradient difference of the surface to accelerate droplets without relying on an external force field. Subsequently, we combined through a dual-structure pairing methodology to facilitate droplet collisions. The findings reveal that an increase in the velocity of the accelerated droplet corresponds to a greater degree of deformation in the fused droplet following collision. Furthermore, higher droplet counts produce greater deformation during collision events. The three driving structures and collision models we designed provide a new experimental method and platform for studying droplet driving and droplet collision."

In high-precision tasks or high-load environments, such stress can lead to premature wear or catastrophic failure. Understanding stress distribution is critical for ensuring the structural integrity, efficiency, and longevity of robotic joints. This paper proposes a computational framework that integrates mathematical modeling, computational techniques, and sensor placement strategies to optimize robotic joint design and performance. The framework combines analytical, numerical, and experimental methods to enhance stress predictions, reduce computational costs, and ensure sensor reliability. The approach will be validated using case studies to demonstrate its versatility and accuracy in various robotic applications."

Simulation of FVP for large-scale scenarios that maintain today's separation requirements will show whether the number of potential conflicts is also reduced, as it was the case with the introduction of free route airspace.

Its architecture features a modular hardware design for reliability, a sophisticated power management unit with a supercapacitor for graceful shutdown to ensure data integrity, and an independent, solar-ready power supply for long-term autonomous field deployment. Performance was rigorously evaluated through a series of experiments. The results demonstrate that the device operates reliably across a wide ambient temperature range of -40°C to 60°C. Critically, it maintains excellent spectral linearity and energy resolution in high-flux radiation fields up to 301 uGy/h, which corresponds to a raw detector input pulse rate of 1.63 Mcps.

One popular learning method is called SpikeTiming Dependent Plasticity (STDP), which follows the idea that “neurons that fire together, wire together.” By combining STDP circuits with some additional components, we can build hardware that learns efficiently and uses far less energy. In this article, we propose a STDP circuit design and study the functionality of the STDP circuit. The circuit was designed using GF180nm PDK in Ngspice.

Handwriting as a behavioural biometric is a distinctive behavioural trait that offers significant information about an individual’s emotional status through measurable differences in features like stroke pressure, writing slant, pen lift, speed, and letter spacing. With analysis of these attributes, it becomes possible to categorize emotions, which prevail among students during examination times. The research has a multidisciplinary perspective in that it utilizes image processing technology combined with machine learning algorithms for extracting and processing handwriting attributes of scanned examination sheets. The system proposed focuses on accuracy and reliability in identifying subtle emotional signals from handwriting patterns. The results are expected to offer greater insights into the psychological states of students during examinations, providing a new window of opportunity for educators, psychologists, and educational institutions. Such insights can help in developing emotionally supportive learning environments by identifying students experiencing emotional distress and taking timely interventions.

    "abstract": "The UAV market has experienced significant growth, with an expanding range of applications. However, the reliance of UAV missions on GNSS makes them vulnerable to attacks, particularly GNSS spoofing and jamming, which can cause mission failure or even physical damage. To mitigate this risk, we propose a lightweight fleet protocol designed to ensure that drones can complete their missions securely, even when under attack. Our system utilizes intra-fleet communication and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements for positioning, enabling the fleet to maintain formation and reach its destination even under GNSS attacks, or in a GNSS compromised scenario, thus avoiding its vulnerabilities. The proposed protocol was evaluated through extensive simulations using NS-3. The results reveal that the proposed protocol achieves a high mission success rate, reaching 100 % in most single-attack scenarios, and demonstrates robust attack identification even when multiple drones are attacked or compromised. The average attack detection delay was measured at 300 milliseconds for single-attacker scenarios, while the RSSI table was updated every 50 to 55 milliseconds, ensuring data freshness. These findings highlight the potential of our solution to improve the resilience of UAV swarms in GNSS-compromised environments."

This paper proposes a six-leg coupled inductor and PWM rectifier cell-based topology that attenuates the harmonics in transformer winding current to almost negligible value, which allows the use of a regular multi-winding transformer without overrating. The power cell includes a three-phase PWM rectifier that ensures balanced grid current even if there is unbalance at the output side.

Annual power consumption was used as the prediction object to create a regression modeling pattern. In the model training implementation stage, five-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization methods were used to improve generalization ability, and an error monitoring mechanism was added to ensure the stability of the prediction. The experimental results show that the average error rate of the constructed model in multiple samples does not exceed 1.2%, showing a strong fitting effect and robustness. Further analysis was carried out with the help of feature perturbation and strategy simulation, and the trend of energy efficiency changes before and after optimization was evaluated. The use of heat pump control and nighttime shutdown methods can reduce power consumption by more than 5%.

However, frequent battery replacements via surgery pose health risks. This paper proposes a piezoelectric ultrasound energy harvester (PUEH) as a promising solution to prolong IMDs’ battery life. It is noteworthy that confined ultrasound within a small region, such as between human skin and IMDs, generates standing waves. As demonstrated in this paper, these standing waves induce significant oscillations in the output power of a single piezoelectric (PZ) diaphragm as the IMD’s depth varies. Consequently, single-diaphragm-based PUEHs are unsuitable for powering IMDs’ batteries. To address this issue, the proposed PUEH features a multi-diaphragm-based piezoelectric device with different resonant frequencies for each of the diaphragm structures. The performance of the proposed multi-diaphragmbased PUEH has been evaluated using COMSOL Multiphysics, simulating in an environment equivalent to the inside of the human body. The proposed multi-diaphragm-based PUEH optimized for operation in a multi-toned ultrasonic environment, is capable of generating a peak power output of approximately $140 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$ at a tissue depth of around 1.6 mm. Additionally, it is capable to generate over $30 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$ of power at tissue depths up to 6 mm. This makes it a viable solution for powering implanted medical devices, such as pacemakers."

In this context, green hydrogen—produced via electrolysis using renewable electricity—has gained prominence as a viable energy carrier. It offers a low-carbon alternative for sectors with high energy demand and limited electrification potential, thereby contributing to both energy system flexibility and long-term environmental sustainability. This study proposes an Multi-Carrier energy System (MCES) operational framework for biomass-derived green hydrogen production, incorporating photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy, along with biomass electrolyzers, battery energy storage (BES) and hydrogen storage (HS) to enhance system efficiency and reliability. To address uncertainties in renewable generation, energy demand and market fluctuations, an Information Gap Decision theory-based Normalized Weighted-Sum (IGDT-NWS) approach is employed. This approach is applied to solve a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to optimize operational costs and minimize carbon emissions while addressing the inherent uncertainties in the system while addressing the impact of uncertainties. Additionally, this study highlights the advantages of integrating HS with BES to enhance overall energy efficiency. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves a 36.17% reduction in IEH operational costs by using the and a 33.63% decrease in environmental impact, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting cost-efficient and sustainable energy system operation."

Models such as Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are trained using two different embedding methods: Word2Vec and Text Vectorization. All models are optimized using Bayesian Optimization to tune hyperparameters. Despite this tuning, models trained with Text Vectorization embeddings showed poor performance and overfitting.

    "abstract": "Contemporary English is facing rapid changes owing to its users communicating with one another electronically and building a distinct culture in the usages of language. Linguistics are often studied traditionally using manual and semi-automated means, which cannot fully scale and sometimes overlook the subtleties of a dynamic usage of a language. Thus, this research aims to develop a computational framework for the digital assessment of linguistic characteristics in modern English, using advanced NLP tools and a corpus-based perspective to highlight subtle variations in syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Parties that previously researched the isolation of lexical or grammatical features thus explored an integrative approach-combining quantitative frequency analysis, post tagging, sentiment analysis, and contextual interpretation. The proposed hybrid model puts together any useful observations to gain a better understanding of modern in-the-field contextual applications of English, especially in digital and informal contexts. The framework relies on a tagged corpus of contemporary texts in line with NLP processing pipelines. It applies statistical modeling and machine learning classifiers with high precision to identify linguistic trends. The system achieved an overall classification accuracy of 92.4% in the detectable contextual appropriateness and linguistic shifts across genres. The evaluation demonstrated that there were clear distinctions in vocabulary richness, syntactic preferences, and sentiment inclinations for the formal compared to informal domains. Informal texts, it is worth noting, exhibit considerably higher present-past contrast between contractions, emoji use, and pragmatic markers. In conclusion, thus computational approach greatly advances digital evaluation of English language use by providing linguists, teachers, and AI developers with a simple tool for real-time observation of and analysis into the evolution of language."

    "abstract": "In this work we provide an optimal assignment of edge IoT nodes to act as hash calculators for blockchain mining using Pareto dominance sorting. IoT nodes being resource constrained are not suited to execute intensive mining operations individually. But, collectively they can be used small parallel computation cores for hash calculation within a specific nonce range. We propose an assignment algorithm that selects a set of IoT nodes which are expected to consume the least amount of resources by assigning the mining tasks over those nodes. Assuming that a prior empirical relation is known for each node that can predict the expected amount of mining resources like energy and time of mining, before each mining epoch, the proposed algorithm calculates the expected resource consumption values for all the nodes. It then sorts the nodes into different Pareto fronts based on dominated sorting and further, for each front it calculates a cumulative inter-Pareto distance for each node. We show that by selecting the nodes as per the sorted inter-Pareto distance, an optimal selection is achieved that reduces the overall composite resource consumption for block mining. Through detailed experimental analysis, we have corroborated our claims, where we find that proposed algorithm achieves a benefit of $47.71 \\%$ with respect to energy consumption and a benefit of $19.27 \\%$ with respect to improvement in mining time over other selection algorithms."

    "abstract": "Emotion detection from text is vital in understanding human communication and improving interactions across various platforms. While most existing work has focused on monolingual emotion recognition, multilingual emotion detection remains underexplored, particularly in India, where linguistic diversity plays a significant role in daily communication. This study aims to bridge this gap by addressing emotion detection in multilingual text, explicitly focusing on English, Hindi, and Kannada. The proposed approach uses a BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) network with an attention mechanism to effectively capture and classify a wide range of emotions from tweets. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which categorizes text into basic sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral), emotion analysis in this work classifies text into 13 distinct emotions, including joy, sadness, anger, love, and more. The model reduces the feature space compactness by incorporating tokenization, enhancing its efficiency and accuracy. The results highlight the potential of BiLSTM-based models for multilingual emotion detection and emphasize the importance of understanding emotions in diverse linguistic settings, particularly for mental health monitoring and improving communication in multilingual societies."

This article presents a new and hybrid deep learning-based method of diagnosing faults in the drive motors of electric vehicles (EV). In contrast to standard CNNLSTM approaches that depend on SoftMax classification, the introduced framework combines a Random Forest (RF) classifier to enhance the generalization, interpretability, and robustness of fault prediction. Furthermore meant for use on edge computing equipment with IoT integration, the design allows for real-time monitoring in resource-limited settings. The introduced algorithm utilizes a Random Forest (RF) classifier for accurate fault classification after integrating the convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract both spatial and temporal features from motor data. The presented mechanism shows higher accuracy (98.1%) and computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, and it can be implemented in real time on edge computing systems, facilitating continuous motor condition monitoring in electric vehicles."

    "abstract": "Current extended reality (XR) systems predominantly rely on conventional authentication methods such as password entry or iris recognition. However, password-based login in immersive environments is cumbersome due to the difficulty of operating virtual keyboards, while iris recognition often fails for users wearing head-mounted displays or glasses. Inspired by the emerging use of companion devices for realtime authentication, we propose a novel edge-cloud collaborative motion-based authentication framework tailored for XR systems. In our approach, the edge device first employs a lightweight machine learning model to extract a user's action sequence in the form of SMPL-X parameters, which are then encoded into a compact motion-password representation. To ensure both privacy and robustness against motion variability, the encoded sequence is further protected using error correction coding (ECC), transforming it into a secure binary representation without exposing raw biometric features. Finally, the cloud server verifies the ECCprotected motion-password against stored references, enabling scalable, secure, and low-latency authentication for XR applications. We implement a prototype show superior performance to FMCode and MetaFL: 97.3% accuracy, 0.4% EER, stronger low-FPR behavior, and improved scalability. We also include a security analysis under practical threat models."

    "abstract": "The blistering integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in health care and environmental monitoring has brought with it serious cybersecurity issues which have especially involved the safekeeping of sensitive and real-time data. The traditional centralized security architectures also suffer since they are vulnerable to single points of failure and scale poorly as there are more and more distributed IoT devices. To solve these problems, the paper would suggest an intelligent approach with the name Adaptive AI-Driven Federated Cyber Defense Framework (AA-FCDF). The model would merge federated learning with anomaly detection using reinforcement learning to provide real time decentralized real time threat identification without degrading privacy of data. Each IoT object has a lightweight local model that is trained on device-specific data and make encrypted model updates in a centralized aggregator periodically. This will facilitate the continued learning throughout the network and not compromise the information on health and the environment. Further, a scoring system based on trust performs a dynamic evaluation of the behaviour of the devices isolating or applying enhanced encryption protocols to potentially compromised nodes. The responsiveness to the two zero-day attack, internal attack, and spoofing issue is possible due to the flexibility of the system. Experiments on the simulation are showing higher accuracy of detection, less leakage of data, higher response speed than traditional models. The suggested AA-FCDF technique attained an overall accuracy of 97.4% in the assessment of cybersecurity efficiency inside IoT systems."

More importantly, we aim to identify the most influential features driving these predictions through eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques. To this end, we selected Gradient Boosting as our predictive model and applied SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess feature importance. We then generated Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) on the topranking features identified by SHAP to further explore their impact on the model's output. Scores from Item 9, Item 3, and Item 1 of the BDI-II scales, regarding Suicidal Thoughts, Sadness and Failure emerged as key predictors in the model."

    "abstract": "Human action recognition plays a critical role in applications such as surveillance, sports analytics, and assistive technologies. With the increasing availability of video data, developing models that are both accurate and efficient has become essential. Despite progress, existing methods struggle to jointly capture fine-grained spatial semantics and long-range temporal dynamics, especially in real-world videos with motion blur, occlusions, and complex scenes. These challenges limit their robustness and scalability. Conventional CNNs efficiently encode spatial information but are insufficient for modeling temporal dependencies. In contrast, pure transformer-based models, though powerful for temporal reasoning, often incur high computational costs and underperform on spatially localized patterns. To address these limitations, this study propose a Dual-Path Hybrid Action Recognition (DP-HAR) framework that integrates a CNN path based on EfficientNet-B3 and a transformer path using MobileViT-S with 128-dimensional embeddings and 4-head attention. The outputs are fused via late concatenation followed by a lightweight 1D convolutional layer (kernel size = 3) for spatiotemporal integration. This work evaluate DP-HAR on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, comprising 13,320 and 6,766 videos across 101 and 51 action classes, respectively. These benchmarks include challenging conditions like camera motion, occlusion, and background clutter. DP-HAR achieves 93.6% Top-1 accuracy on UCF101 and 71.5% on HMDB51, outperforming existing CNN and transformer models. It maintains real-time performance at 110 FPS with only 14.2 M parameters and 28.6 GFLOPs. In conclusion, DP-HAR offers an effective and lightweight solution for video-based action recognition, combining high accuracy with low latency for deployment in practical environments."

The application of lean system development assurance processes boosts confidence in the system design while minimizing additional overhead. Certification considerations are identified and addressed during the system design.

However, their early-stage identification is challenging due to latent trajectories and complex dynamics. Traditional forecasting methods often fall short. In this paper, a two-stage framework is proposed, integrating multi-feature indicator prediction with technological network structure analysis to identify disruptive technologies. First, we construct a tripartite assessment framework encompassing technological novelty, market impact, and social effects. Machine learning models are then utilised to initially screen for patents with high disruptive potential. Then, for these pre-selected candidates, we employ graph representation learning, constructing Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to analyze their core node status within the technological network, thereby validating their disruptive nature. Empirical validation using AI-domain patent data demonstrates the framework's effectiveness. The study identifies 8 categories of high-potential disruptive technologies in Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantifies feature contributions, and provides strategic implications."

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is widely used in the navigation of social robotic systems. Model-driven approaches (or Physics-based algorithms) cannot capture the complexity of social compliance, and thus, data-driven approaches are widely used. We study a diffusion-based trajectory prediction algorithm that generates samples of trajectories from a learned distribution. We observe that while the generator keeps the trajectory close to the ground truth trajectory for at least one sample, most of the samples have zig-zag shapes, are kinematically infeasible and unrealistic. These attributes are absent in the model-driven approaches. As the first objective, we force the trajectory generator to output kinematically feasible and smooth trajectories. Since humans can kinematically take sharp turns, our notion of kinematic constraints is soft; smoother turns are preferable, while the model should allow sharp turns if necessary. As another objective, we also critically analyse the public datasets for algorithmic ease of handling corner cases like sharp turns, high densities, high/low travel speeds, a large number of people, etc. and thus characterize datasets by complexity in corner cases. High-interaction datasets have corner cases that are hard to learn, as they represent the heavy-tail problem. We evaluate the datasets specifically on those corner cases. We show that the inclusion of soft kinematics smoothness constraints is particularly valuable for high complexity datasets."

A novel system grounded in the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been developed to enhance financial risk prediction. The system employs the PSO algorithm, which mimics the behavior of swarms in nature, optimizing prediction models through iterative searches for the most efficient solutions. The system identifies patterns and anomalies that signal potential risks by processing large volumes of financial data. The PSO algorithm refines these predictions by dynamically adjusting the system's parameters, leading to a more accurate and timely detection of financial threats. Financial indicators such as market volatility, liquidity, and investment flows are analyzed to assess risk levels. The system's real-time capabilities allow for rapid response, significantly improving decision-making in risk management. Extensive simulations show the PSO-based model outperforming traditional methods regarding precision and computational efficiency.

Therefore, this article presents a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for a PV-interfaced MMC (PV-MMC) aimed at mitigating the issues caused by an unbalanced grid, as mentioned above. The developed MPC simultaneously regulates positive- and negative-sequence currents, DC-link and submodule capacitor voltages of the PV-MMC without needing distinct cost functions. In addition, a variable-rate off maximum power point tracking algorithm is developed to limit solar power generation during grid unbalance. The developed MPC eliminates cascaded proportional-integral loops, complex parameter tuning, and double-frequency oscillations in power and DC-link voltage. It efficiently controls power output of the PV generating station, submodule capacitor voltages, and provides grid support under grid abnormalities. The developed MPC is tested and validated to showcase its effectiveness and robustness using MATLAB simulations under different operating conditions."

The DeepSeek-V3.1 model is integrated into the core iterative process of WOA to achieve adaptive parameter adjustment and intelligent strategy adjustment. Specifically, LLM-WOA is designed with two core mechanisms: 1) The LLM-assisted parameter and strategy decision-making module, which enables LLM to dynamically output the contraction factor a, spiral coefficient b, and exploration/exploitation strategy probability based on the real-time optimization status through precise Prompt engineering; 2) The LLM-guided local optimal escape mechanism, which generates population perturbation strategies to restore search diversity when the algorithm stagnates. To validate the algorithm’s performance, a comparative experiment was conducted with the traditional WOA in the CEC2022 test set. The results show that LLM-WOA outperforms the traditional WOA in eleven test functions, indicating that the introduction of LLM can effectively solve the insufficient adaptive ability of the traditional WOA and provide a more efficient solution for complex optimization problems.

    "abstract": "Existing drug recommendation studies primarily rely on electronic health record data; however, they often lack detailed information on doctor-patient interactions, which makes it difficult to reflect patients’ actual conditions fully. Medical dialogues preserve complete interaction information and hold greater application potential, but their data generally suffers from sparse labeling. To address this, this paper proposes a dialogue-based drug recommendation method that combines contrastive learning with multi-hop reasoning on knowledge graphs to enhance the effectiveness of recommendations. First, we introduce a graph contrastive learning approach based on singular value decomposition. This method enhances data representation through global relationship modeling, mitigating label scarcity while preserving semantic structural stability. Second, we design a knowledge graph multi-hop reasoning model that integrates precursor paths and connecting paths. An attention mechanism distinguishes the importance of different entities and relationships, yielding more accurate semantic representations. Experimental results demonstrate the method’s superior performance in reducing noise interference, inferring missing knowledge, and improving recommendation accuracy. The path attention mechanism further enhances the interpretability of the results."

Such vehicles are essential in applications such as inspection of offshore installations, water sampling, and surveying remote areas. Owing to the vast differences in the physical properties (density and viscosity) of the two media in which these robots operate, designing such a robot presents design conflicts. This research addresses one of those key challenges by focusing on designing a pressure vessel catered to reduce drag along the multiphase fluid flow conditions in the Surge (Horizontal) and Heave (Vertical) axes underwater, which can be extended to air. Optimising the design of the pressure hull plays an essential role in enhancing the efficiency of the overall system. Conventional pressure vessels in the literature focus on streamlining the flow along one of the axes, penalising those designs in their complementary mediums. In this research, multiple designs have been tested for drag coefficients in fluid flow and structural integrity using Static FEA on Solidworks. Simulation results demonstrate that characteristic bioinspired designs (for instance, Manta ray and Bulbous bow inspired pressure vessels) are structurally capable of withstanding the hydrostatic pressure, and these streamlined designs experience less drag when compared to the initial design of the cylindrical hull. This research presents a novel Manta ray-inspired design that significantly reduces drag compared to conventional pressure hulls. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design can achieve a $74.92 \\%$ reduction in surge motion and $64.26 \\%$ in heave motion compared to existing pressure vessels as in the literature."

These lightweight, deployable structures significantly reduce launch mass and volume, making them attractive for small satellites and deep-space applications. However, the performance of such membrane reflectors is highly sensitive to surface accuracy, which in turn is governed by the tension forces applied at the anchor points. Any external disturbance, especially from space debris, can adversely affect these forces and thereby degrade antenna performance. The present study investigates numerically, the effect of the debris impact on the tension forces, deformations of the membrane reflector.

After standardization, encoding, and other processing, multimodal feature fusion is performed to obtain comprehensive data features that reflect the relationship between line loss and influencing factors. Next, a model incorporating improved grey relational analysis, dual weight attention mechanism, and LSTM Transformer hybrid network is constructed to effectively capture the dynamic correlation between features and line loss rate, enhance attention to key features, improve line loss prediction accuracy, and establish a model parameter update mechanism to adapt to dynamic data changes.

Due to their intricate design and operational complexity, these reactors require advanced and dependable control strategies to effectively regulate output power. Among modern approaches, fractional-order control has gained notable interest for its ability to provide enhanced setpoint tracking, better disturbance handling, and improved system stability. Concurrent progress in optimization methods has further supported the creation of fractional-order PID controllers that deliver accurate results with reduced computational demands. This study integrates these advancements by proposing a robust and efficient control method for PHWR power regulation. The method applies the Distance Levy Flight-Based Crow Search Algorithm (DLCSA) to determine optimal parameters for a fractional-order PID controller. Comparative analysis using multiple integral error metrics shows that the DLCSA-based controller achieves superior performance over existing techniques."

This rotor position data is essential for determining the phase commutation points and for calculating the speed. This article focuses on a position sensorless strategy of a three-phase 12/8 SRM. The turnoff angle position and the phase commutation position are determined by comparing the reference flux linkage with the phase flux linkage. The phase flux linkage is calculated without requiring a voltage sensor, as the phase voltages are estimated based on the applied switching pattern. The initial active phase, or the startup phase, is determined using the pulse injection method. The speed is estimated using the phase excitation sequence."

An effective way to address this issue is feature selection, which aims to identify and retain only the most informative features. In problems where label information is not available, unsupervised feature selection becomes crucial. To perform unsupervised feature selection, we can use normalized mutual information to identify features that carry similar information, allowing us to reduce dimensionality without significant loss of relevant information. Here, we present an efficient method for the estimation of normalized mutual information using maximal separation."

    "abstract": "Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (TPMSMs) with Fractional Slot Concentrated Winding (FSCW) are widely used in electric vehicles, due to their high torque density, efficiency, and broad speed range. A major challenge stems from the subharmonic and superharmonic components of the stator’s magneto-motive force, which contribute to increased rotor losses and can also cause saturation effects. This paper examines the impact of introduction of two shifted stators, similar to the base stator but shifted by shift angles on the harmonic contents while maximizing the performance of the motor. Findings reveal that second order stator shifting can effectively minimize harmonics responsible for rotor losses while enhancing the performance parameters of fractional-slot concentrated winding designs. This approach introduces harmonic cancellation as a targeted method to reduce harmonics and reduce the machine’s phase inductance. The principle of stator shifting will be explored, with an analysis of how adjusting the shift angle influences harmonic components and winding factors. Several designs based on double-layer 12-slots/10-pole configurations are examined, each with different shift angles. These designs are compared in terms of power density, efficiency, and torque ripple to evaluate their performance."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of brain tumors based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images relies heavily on the doctor's personal experience and visible lesion features. At the same time, when faced with a large number of MRI images, the doctor's diagnostic speed and accuracy are easily affected. To achieve rapid screening and reduce misdiagnosis rates, artificial intelligence technology has gradually been applied to the diagnosis of brain tumors. This article proposes a dual branch autoencoder model, abbreviated as DCA, which uses the encoder of traditional denoising autoencoders to extract multi-level features, introduces a classifier model at the end of the encoder, and introduces skip connections between the encoder and decoder. Compared with completing two tasks independently, collaborative learning of denoising and classification tasks is achieved by sharing encoder features, effectively reducing the number of model parameters. At the same time, due to the ability of one training and inference to simultaneously complete both denoising and classification tasks, it has higher diagnostic efficiency. This article conducted extensive experiments on the brain tumor MRI dataset from Kaggle. The experimental results show that firstly, the DCA model exhibits good classification and denoising capabilities on images with different levels of noise; Secondly, under the same noise intensity, the classification and denoising performance of the DCA model is significantly better than that of a simple classification and denoising model."

However, with advancements in detection technologies, there is a growing need for faster and more efficient methods to assess the threat levels of these objects. The proposed system uses machine learning techniques to classify NEOs and predict their potential risk. The goal was to determine whether an object is potentially hazardous or not based on the patterns in this data. This study demonstrates the value of combining traditional scientific approaches with modern data-driven methods. As the volume of astronomical data continues to grow, machine learning techniques will play a key role in enhancing global safety from potential asteroid threats."

In the absence of citric acid, zein formed uniformly sized spherical structures. Treatment with 0.1% w/v citric acid preserved the spherical morphology but reduced the number of assemblies while increasing their size. In the presence of 0.4% w/v citric acid, zein assemblies exhibited a bimodal size distribution, with tightly packed small particles and loosely aggregated larger particles. Further increasing the citric acid concentration to 0.7% w/v resulted in a decrease in smaller zein self-assemblies and improved the average size and height. Notably, 1.0% w/v citric acid drastically reduced assembly quantity and generated exceptionally large structures. These results highlight that citric acid critically regulator the self-assembly dynamics of zein. This work provides a foundation for tailoring zein nanostructures via citric acid mediation."

    "abstract": "A core challenge in uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) path planning lies in the potentially high risks caused by deviations between planned paths and actual flight trajectories in complex dynamic environments. In this paper, we study path planning through two phases of pre-flight and in-flight planning. A ground risk map is constructed by integrating real-world spatial characteristics. Based on this map, a pre-flight path planning method combining BRESENHAM and A* algorithms (B-A*) is proposed, aiming at balancing the path distance with the risk cost, as well as achieving path optimization. Highfidelity simulations of actual flight trajectories are performed to calculate confidence intervals, thereby constructing an operation volume (OV) that ensures the actual flight path remains within a safe envelope. During the in-flight phase, a real-time collision avoidance strategy based on time windows is proposed for dynamic environments. Alternative paths are generated via a path offset model, and collision risks with dynamic obstacles are evaluated by calculating the closest point of approach (CPA). The optimal avoidance path is selected by comprehensively weighing risk and distance costs. A reverse fitting method is designed to recover the original path smoothly after collision avoidance. Experiments using simulations demonstrate its ability to significantly reduce flight risks in complex environments while enhancing path safety and execution stability."

Due to discontinuous mode operation, number of sensor required is less and grid side synchronization is not required in order to operate at unity power factor. The interleaved structure reduces the ripple in the grid current resulting into improved power quality. The study of the converter operation and parameter design are presented in this paper. A simple control using a single current controller is used to regulate the converter output current for battery charging application.

This relation is crucial for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including textual entailment, search query expansion, and machine translation. In this systematic literature review, the hypernymy relation in the context of NLP is investigated, with a focus on identifying hypernymy-related tasks, employed approaches, available resources, and future research directions. The reviewed studies were extracted from five pre-defined databases, covering the period from 2018 to March 2023. The review process identified 75 primary studies that were analyzed to extract the targeted tasks, languages, approaches, representations, and datasets. The synthesized data were used to address the review questions. The review identifies the main hypernymy-related tasks, including hypernymy extraction, detection, directionality, graded lexical entailment, and discovery. The evaluation practices employed were summarized, including accuracy, F1, Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Spearman’s correlation coefficient. The targeted languages are highlighted, with English being the most studied; however, multilingual coverage is steadily growing. Several benchmark datasets for each task are presented, along with their statistics, characteristics, and construction techniques. Additionally, representation techniques are summarized, ranging from Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe to hypernymy-specific representations. Finally, research gaps are discussed, and potential future directions are outlined. This review consolidates scattered findings and provides a practical map of tasks, resources, and techniques for researchers building hypernymy-aware NLP systems."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of road segmentation in remote sensing images—such as elongated structures, blurred boundaries, and the high cost of annotations—this paper proposes a semi-supervised segmentation framework tailored for low-label scenarios. The framework effectively reduces reliance on large-scale annotated datasets by fully leveraging latent structural information from unlabeled data. Specifically, a structure-aware reliability reweighting module (SRRM) is introduced to dynamically adjust the confidence of pseudo labels based on edge priors, improving label quality in boundary regions. In addition, a cross-fusion supervision (CFS) mechanism is designed to integrate predictions from different augmentation paths via channel-wise attention, enabling bidirectional optimization and complementary learning of pseudo labels. To enhance feature representation capabilities, a dual-branch network architecture combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers is constructed. The CNN branch focuses on capturing local textures and spatial details, while the Transformer branch models global contextual dependencies. These two branches work collaboratively to accommodate the complex structural characteristics of roads in remote sensing imagery. On top of this backbone, several task-specific modules are further introduced to address common challenges in road segmentation, such as elongated shapes, multi-scale variation, and ambiguous boundaries. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, DeepGlobe and Massachusetts, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 80.51% and 81.67% MIoU, respectively, with only 1/32 of labeled data, significantly outperforming existing mainstream methods and showcasing strong generalization ability and practical value."

    "abstract": "Pandemics often arise from the diffusion of infectious diseases over large regions, spanning multiple continents. Effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) at the onset of an outbreak can significantly curb the spread. However, the complexity of human interactions can hinder the strict and timely imposition of such measures. Given the extensive damage caused by COVID-19, it is imperative to develop computational strategies that control and prevent the global spread of infectious diseases. This study proposes a model of COVID-19 spread networks, formulated based on daily confirmed cases per country, with mutual information as a measure of interdependence between countries. Utilizing graph theory, this approach identifies key nodes (countries) that play influential roles in the COVID-19 spread network. A control framework based on network theory is then introduced to mitigate and potentially eradicate further infection spread. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework holds substantial promise in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 and similar outbreaks when implemented promptly."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made resource exchange and collaboration across diverse IoT domains commonplace, necessitating secure and privacy-preserving cross-domain authentication. However, existing schemes suffer from critical limitations: they lack time-bound access control, leading to persistent unauthorized access and heightened security risks, and most are incomplete, requiring resource-intensive redeployment of cryptographic mechanisms and increasing management overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic time-bound anonymous complete cross-domain authentication scheme that leverages consortium blockchain for decentralized trust, embeds dual temporal constraints, expiration time and permissible authentication periods, into credentials for fine-grained access control and automatic natural revocation, and employs accumulators and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">NIZKs</i>) to enable anonymous authentication while ensuring strong privacy protection. Crucially, the proposed scheme achieves complete cross-domain authentication without modifying existing cryptographic mechanisms, significantly reducing overhead in computational, communication, and storage. Security and performance analyses confirm that the proposed scheme not only guarantees robust security and privacy but also outperforms existing schemes in efficiency."

    "abstract": "6-DoF grasp pose estimation is crucial for achieving robust robot manipulation. Despite significant progress in data-driven methods, the cross-view adaptability of 6-DoF grasp pose estimation remains insufficient. Under the condition of observing some certain viewpoints, the performance of pose estimation is relatively low. In response, this paper introduces VRGraspNet, a novel 6-DoF grasp pose estimation model designed to enhance the robustness and performance of robotic grasping across diverse viewpoints. The key to the VRGraspNet lies in filling in the holes in the scene point cloud and learning multimodal features for seed points. The former provides dense neighborhood points for the seed point, while the latter provides richer information for extracting geometric features of the local area to which the seed point belongs. Furthermore, this paper proposes a Performance-Viewpoint jointly Weighted Loss (PVWL), with the key being two weight factors: a static viewpoint position dependent weight factor that focuses on challenging samples, and a dynamic performance related weight factor that focuses on samples difficult to learn. Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1Billion dataset demonstrate that VRGraspNet achieves SOTA performance and strong cross-view robustness. Real-world robot experiments further validate its practicality in robotic manipulation tasks. Our source code is available at https://github.com/huamo555/VRGraspNet."

OSA is characterized by repeated pauses in breathing during sleep, leading to oxygen deficiency and disrupted sleep patterns. It produces irritation, daytime drowsiness, and various other disease states like cardiovascular illnesses. We are using Machine Learning algorithms like (XGBoost, Random Forest, KNN etc.), Deep Learning algorithms like (CNN, RNN, LSTM) and combined in a stacked ensemble. Diagnostic for detection of the Obstructive sleep apnea through the implementation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.Likewise, the traditional method Polysomnography (PSG) (PSG is a long study of sleep in which it considers more than one body sign like brain waves, heart beat, breathing, and blood oxygen level are monitored continuously while sleeping.) is utilized to detect sleep disorders but time-consuming, expensive, and always continuous patient monitoring. A cheaper, improved, and light detection method of OSA was conceived. ECG signals allow cardiac activity to be captured by a low-cost and non-invasive method. It can be a marker of sleep apnea event. We used publicly available Physionet CinC Challenge-2000 database for electrocardiogram signal-based detection of Obstructive sleep apnea. There are 70 original records. The duration of the ECG signal for all the patients ranges from 25,200 minutes to 36,000 minutes.

Given that sound signals in industrial settings are often accompanied by high-frequency noise interference and that fixed-bandwidth filter banks struggle to effectively capture features with significant time-frequency local characteristics, this paper proposes a model called ASLMgram (SCSA) for mechanical equipment anomaly sound detection based on adaptive noise reduction and frequency-domain feature fusion. The model’s performance was evaluated using the anomaly sound detection dataset provided by DCASE 2020 TASK 2. The results showed that the model achieved AUC, pAUC, and mAUC ($\\min$ AUC) performance of 91.36%, 84.47%, and 81.14%, respectively.

Various research endeavours aim to alleviate these oscillations through the utilization of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices are conducted, providing efficacious remedies to enhance system stability. Complex nonlinear problems can be handled using fuzzy logic controllers, which apply human knowledge-based control principles. Consequently, in order to minimize inter-area oscillations in power systems, this work presents a unique Fuzzy Logic Wide-Area Damping Controller (FLWADC) based on the Static Var Compensator (SVC). To find the system’s critical inter-area mode, the suggested method is first linearizes the system around the equilibrium point and then performs eigenvalue analysis. The appropriate wide-area feedback signal is then chosen using a geometric approach. The controller parameters are tuned using a metaheuristic Fuzzy Logic (FL) apporach to achieve the desired damping for critical mode. The performance of the suggested control technique is validated on a two-area, four-machine test system. Time-domain simulations and frequency responses to small-scale disturbance demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested controller. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the suggested controller is tested over a wide variety of time delays."

These vulnerabilities are further exacerbated in low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), where the absence of centralized coordination renders the network an attractive target for jamming attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel split and classification mechanism designed to enhance LoRa packet delivery under both constant and reactive jamming conditions. Our approach partitions each LoRa frame into sub-packets and applies a realtime classification algorithm to identify and mitigate corrupted segments, thereby improving the effective data extraction ratio (DER). We validate the mechanism through extensive simulated scenarios across diverse network densities. Comparative analysis against the standard LoRa protocol demonstrates a significant increase in packet success rate and commensurate gain in DER, without incurring additional energy overhead."

By utilizing clean energy for battery charging, the proposed SPV array promotes sustainable and eco-friendly operation. A bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDDC) is installed to improve operational efficiency by recuperating and storing braking energy during regenerative braking events, thereby enhancing the vehicle's driving range. In place of a conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller, a variable structure active disturbance rejection controller (VSADRC) is used to enhance the disturbance rejection and noise suppression capability of the system while estimating speed. To achieve optimized torque control by minimizing the currents, the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) technique is applied. Accurate rotor position estimation is critical for vector control and it is obtained through an adaptive sliding mode observer (ASMO) coupled with a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC) technique. The ASMO demonstrates superior robustness against parameter variations and external disturbances in the estimation of back EMFs with minimal chattering. Meanwhile, the CDSC method efficiently acquires the rotor position and speed from the estimated electromotive force (EMF)s. The proposed control scheme integrates these advanced techniques to improve the dynamic performance, accuracy, and distortion-free operation of the PMaSyRM drive-based LEV. As a result, it also enables the smooth and efficient operation of the LEV."

During the recordings of the EEG signals, the movement of the eye balls and eye blinks leads to the ocular artifacts. Hence, elimination of the artifacts plays a major role in the diagnosis and illustration of the EEG signals. In the proposed work Empirical wavelet transform (EWT-FB) filter bank employing points of dyadic boundary is utilized for the segmentation of the artifact affected EEG signal. For the denoising application Savitzky-Goley Driven Total Variation (SGD-TV) filter is employed. The filter signal is obtained by applying SGDTV filter to the first subband generated from the segmented signal.

Additionally, there is a growing need to explore emerging technologies in IoT and TinyML to modernize healthcare monitoring and address existing gaps in system intelligence, scalability, and privacy. This paper presents a privacy-preserving intelligent system designed to predict the compliance of operating room environments with ISO standards by continuously monitoring key parameters such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and pressure.

Simulations were performed using an IHP's 130 nm CMOS standard cell library in Cadence Spectre, focusing on propagation delay and power consumption across different supply voltages, temperatures and transistor dimensions. The Power Delay Product (PDP) was used to evaluate overall efficiency.

    "abstract": "To be able to integrate solar power into the electrical grid successfully, grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems are critical to the shift towards renewable energy sources. Yet they are susceptible to cyberattacks, especially False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, due to their dependence on digital control and communication networks. By recognizing weak points along the power converter control system, i.e., along the MPPT and Voltage Source Converter (VSC) control loops, this paper explores the cyber-physical security of these systems. Specifically, the reference DC-link voltage and the PV current are two significant FDI attack vectors that are explored. The MATLAB/Simulink simulation results prove that attacks result in a drastic drop in system performance, such as distorted current of the grid, degraded MPPT functioning, instability of actual DC-link voltage and a peak rise in the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the grid current---far exceeding IEEE standards. The subsequent power quality problems, system losses and resultant damage to converter components from voltage stress are also analyzed in this study. These observations indicate an immediate need for effective detection and mitigation methods to ensure grid-integrated PV systems run reliably under situations of cyberattack."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses SAFAAI, a smart plastic waste management system designed to increase waste segregation and encourage sustainable disposal by using deep learning and the Internet of Things (IoT). SAFAAI uses an object detection model based on the YOLOv5 architecture that is incorporated into a smart bin that contains sensors and a camera to correctly identify plastic waste. Users authenticate themselves using RFID cards and receive credit incentives for proper disposal, encouraging consistent recycling habits. Non-plastic waste is automatically redirected for separate handling. Additionally, real-time tracking of waste levels helps administrators streamline collection schedules and optimize bin capacity. The technologies that comprise SAFAAI can be applied at scale to resolve deficiencies in the previous models which only recognized certain types of plastics and a set of standards lacked systems of engagement to create user properties so that the user engages with the system when they were motivated to act, and not limited to using only a couple of types of plastics. On the whole, SAFAAI provides durable, data-driven, and user-centered framework for addressing plastic waste, while promoting a sense of environmental stewardship in both public and institutional contexts. There is also the added provision for a compression unit, which would shred the collected plastic waste to facilitate its recycling for repurposing in sustainable products, such as plastic bricks."

A key component of the design is the uplifting system, which includes the following procedures: split up forecast that modify, and scale. These coefficients for intricacy and approximations can be efficiently computed by dividing the samples that are input between odd and even elements. The technique uses a block-based scanned technique for the updating component and an overlapping block-based scanned method for the forecasting block. There are fewer processes needed and less demand for temporary storage thanks to this architecture. In comparison to other approaches, the suggested methodology achieves a far greater overall accuracy of 99%."

Successively, compressor performance was analysed by varying the pressure and rate of hydrogen supply between metal hydride beds using thermodynamic properties and PCI data. Also, the accurate difference in the pressure caused during hydrogen transfer is presented in the form of a thermodynamic cycle.

This paper proposes a piezoelectric vibration energy harvester with self-adjusting resonant frequency to address the narrow operating bandwidth and environmental adaptability limitations of conventional devices in responding to stochastic excitations. By integrating elastic elements at the initial fixed end of the cantilever beam, axial displacement constraints are released. When environmental excitation frequencies vary, the cantilever beam can elongate or contract through elastic element deformation to adapt to changing vibrational stimuli. A dynamic model of the energy harvester was established, and a simulation platform was developed in MATLAB to investigate the influence of equivalent stiffness parameters on output performance. Comparative experiments with conventional fixed-frequency harvesters demonstrate that the proposed self-adjusting device achieves 33.3% wider effective bandwidth and 20.61% higher peak output voltage."

Systems like LipNet and AutoAVSR have shown strong performance in translating lip movements into textual transcriptions using deep learning. However, challenges remain in sentence-level coherence, especially under noisy conditions or with open-vocabulary inputs. In this work, an LLM-augmented AutoAVSR method for lip reading is proposed and compared against the state-of-the-art LipNet model to enhance transcription accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the dataset like GRID, LRS3, and a custom noisy dataset (VideoVault) demonstrate that LLM-augmented AutoAVSR consistently outperforms the baseline models across all metrics, achieving the lowest Word Error Rates (WER) and highest sentence accuracy. These results underline the importance of coupling visual models with contextual reasoning capabilities for robust real-world lip-reading applications."

Designing an inductive power transfer (IPT) charger that supports both constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) modes while maintaining a unity power factor offers difficulties due to fluctuating load conditions. This paper presents a new parameter tuning approach employing source transformation for the double-sided LCC (DS-LCC) compensation topology. Utilising symmetric LCC networks at both the transmitter and receiver, two resonant frequencies are analytically determined to achieve zero-phase angle (ZPA) operation in both CC and CV modes. A systematic design methodology is established for selecting compensation parameters that reduce reactive power and switching losses, thereby improving over-all efficiency. Time-domain simulations performed in MATLAB/Simulink corroborate the theoretical analysis, exhibiting stable CC and CV modes across diverse loads. The suggested methodology is validated by MATLAB Simulink simulations, illustrating its efficacy in attaining reliable and efficient WPT."

    "abstract": "High-resolution aerial image small object detection faces challenges such as varying scales, insufficient details, and low computational efficiency. This paper proposes a method called Enhanced Cascaded Zoom-in Detector (CZ Detector), which combines adaptive cropping and score enhancement for efficient detection. The method uses a two-stage cascade for detection: the first stage identifies basic targets and dense areas across the entire image, while the second stage applies adaptive cropping to select high-confidence regions for high-resolution zoom-in re-detection. The small object score enhancement strategy increases the classification score based on the relative area of the target, reducing missed detections. This method does not require additional learnable modules; it can be integrated into mainstream detection architectures (such as Faster R-CNN or FCOS) by simply adding “density cropping” auxiliary annotations. Tests on the VisDrone and DOTA datasets show significant improvements in small object detection performance (with the average precision for small objects increasing by up to 4.6%). Additionally, it maintains robustness even without relying on high-resolution feature layers (such as FPN-P2), providing an efficient and lightweight solution for small object detection in high-resolution images.

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties of the porous biomimetic scaffolds need to closely match those of the defective tissue. Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) have gained widespread application in tissue engineering because of their smooth surface transition and low stress concentration. It is worth noting that the influence mechanism of surface curvature on the mechanical properties of these scaffolds remains unclear. In this paper, two typical TPMS lattices are selected to construct structures with identical porosity but varying surface curvatures, and the influence mechanism of surface curvature on the mechanical properties of the scaffolds is revealed based on finite element analysis (FEA). At the same time, the intrinsic relationship between porosity and surface curvature is also discussed. The results show that for structures with the same porosity, a more concentrated surface curvature distribution correlates with enhanced mechanical properties. Taking the structure with porosity of 55% as an example, the elastic modulus of the I-WPT structure is 1.37 times that of the I-WP structure, and the elastic modulus of the GT structure is 1.38 times that of the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$G$</tex> structure. Changes in porosity impact the surface curvature distribution, with higher porosity leading to a more dispersed curvature distribution, which can easily lead to stress concentration of the structure and weaken its bearing capacity. For different types of lattices, mechanical properties are less sensitive to surface curvature than macroscopic geometric features."

Stochastic modeling of forecasted irradiance and PV power is conducted within robust lower and upper bounds based on the availability of irradiance. A total of 1,000 scenarios are generated per hour using a Markov chain and subsequently reduced to 100 scenarios through Gaussian and Weibull clustering techniques. The 100 scenarios reduced by the Gaussian clustering technique are employed to determine the Gaussian probability of the forecasted irradiance and PV-generated power. The probability of the alternative set, reduced by the Weibull clustering technique, is evaluated using the Weibull probability density function (PDF). The forecasting accuracy of both models is assessed using performance metrics, specifically the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results indicate that both Gaussian and Weibull distributions exhibit a reasonable level of predictive probability; however, the Weibull distribution yields lower error rates and higher accuracy. This study provides insights into the applicability of these statistical models for reliable short-term solar forecasting, expanding body of research aimed at improving forecasting techniques for large-scale solar energy projects."

    "abstract": "With the wide application of 5G technology, the global Internet scale has grown sharply, putting forward higher requirements for both traditional network traffic prediction technology and network traffic prediction technology based on deep learning. Especially when dealing with large-scale data, the computational load and accuracy often fail to meet the actual demands. To overcome this problem, this paper introduces quantum technology and for the first time explores the challenge of applying quantum generative adversarial networks to network traffic prediction. Due to the advantage of efficient data processing capabilities of quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN) and the sensitivity of long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to time series, the combination of the two provides a new research direction and application potential for time series analysis and prediction in the quantum field. This paper proposes a quantum generative adversarial network with an LSTM layer added to the generator. The temporal features extracted by LSTM are repeatedly embedded into the quantum circuit of the generator by using Angle encoding and data re-upload strategies. This enables quantum generative adversarial networks to handle temporal dependencies and enhances the expressive power of quantum circuits. Prediction experiments were conducted on the simulation platform using real network traffic data and compared with existing quantum neural network models for time series prediction such as QLSTM. The MAPE, $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$, MAE and RMSE indicators reached $3.4 \\%, 98.6 \\%, 0.018$ and 0.027 respectively, all showing significant advantages."

In particular, we focus on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, introducing some modifications to improve the algorithm's convergence. The PSO algorithm has already been used to design such filters, but in its basic form, it was insufficient to find global extrema for filters longer than about 20. Therefore, we adopted a different approach to the design of such filters. FIR filters of longer lengths can be divided into two or more shorter sections connected in series. Convolution of the impulse responses of these sections allows for the creation of filters with longer impulse responses and thus better frequency properties. In this approach, each section is designed separately by the PSO algorithm. Under certain conditions, it is also possible to design a single short filter and then connect several identical sections in series. This significantly simplifies the entire procedure. Firstly, only a single, short-length filter is designed, and secondly, the PSO algorithm operates in lower-dimensional spaces. This also allows for relatively fast convergence that leads to solutions close to optimal. In this work, we compared the results obtained for 60-length filters designed using the proposed approach and the Blackmann window."

    "abstract": "Current ship detection methods suffer from inherent limitations, including excessive operational complexity, high false detection rates, and frequent missed detections—issues that severely hinder their practical application in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To address these challenges, this study proposes an enhanced lightweight detection algorithm based on YOLOv8, named YOLO-MSFF. First, a lightweight multi-scale hybrid convolution module is designed to mitigate feature redundancy in the downsampling process of the YOLOv8 backbone network, which strengthens the extraction of multi-scale features and thus lays a foundation for the accurate detection of ships with varying sizes. Second, an improved Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) with two cross-layer connections is developed in the neck network to optimize feature aggregation. Additionally, the C2f-Faster module is incorporated to reduce computational overhead during feature fusion, while the Coordinate Attention mechanism and an optimized loss function are introduced to improve the localization accuracy of small ships-a major challenge in ship detection, attributed to their low pixel ratio and weak feature representation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-MSFF outperforms the baseline YOLOv8 model: it achieves a $\\mathbf{2. 2 1 \\%}$ higher detection precision on the constructed ship dataset, with 36.66% fewer parameters and 18.47% lower computational complexity. Notably, the model size is merely a few megabytes, and this ultra-compact characteristic provides a novel and practical solution for deploying ship detection systems on mobile terminal devices with stringent resource constraints."

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave radar systems are extensively applied in intelligent traffic systems (ITS) due to their superior sensing capabilities. As resolution improves, a single detected target may occupy several radar resolution cells simultaneously, known as the extended target (ET) effect. Conventional radar target detection and tracking systems employ the detect-before-track (DBT) framework. However, existing DBT frameworks treat detection and tracking algorithms as independent steps, and their performance degrades significantly when encountering complex scenarios with several nearby targets due to interference from both the ET's own neighboring cells and other ETs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a closed-loop detection-tracking framework exploiting radar ET tracking information. By incorporating a feedback mechanism that utilizes the obtained target shape and motion information from tracking modules into the detection process, the proposed method effectively mitigates inter-target echo interference, achieving mutually reinforcing improvements in both detection and tracking performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances detection and tracking capabilities in complex multi-extended-target scenarios compared to conventional DBT approaches."

This paper therefore explores the significant impact of different material properties on the system performance of an optoelectronic component widely used in varied aerospace system applications, a prospect that will leverage an array of computational tools in the simulation and the analysis of material behaviors under different operational conditions. References underscore the limitations of the traditional experimental models in the evaluation of the complexities found in aerospace materials.

In this, the fundamental role of these simulations in the prediction of material performance as well as in the optimization of the aerospace optoelectronic design parameters remains essential. This paper therefore employs a combination of MD and FEA simulations in the modeling of the behaviors of the aerospace optoelectronic materials that include indium phosphide (InP) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) under different operational and environmental stresses. The findings establish that structural configurations and material composition significantly enhances the performance characteristics of aerospace optoelectronic materials.

The findings therefore validated the efficiency of the simulations based on optimized models."

    "abstract": "While the transparency of blockchain enhances security, it also exposes users' transaction privacy. While existing coin mixing protocols are effective in improving privacy, their fixed participation mechanisms and triggering methods have limitations in terms of flexibility and privacy. In this paper, we propose a flexible hybrid protocol, DPCoinShuffle, which combines a dynamic participation mechanism with an improved shuffling algorithm to enhance the anonymity, unlinkability, and efficiency of the protocol, and supports hybrid triggering strategies based on the number of transactions or time to ensure that the protocol can still operate effectively under the scenarios of uncertain number of participants or uneven transaction arrivals; at the same time, it combines the CLSAG ring with a fixed trigger method, and the CLSAG ring with the CLSAG ring. At the same time, it combines the CLSAG ring signature with the Fisher-Yates algorithm to disrupt the order of output addresses and enhance the perturbation ability of the output addresses. Experimental results show that DPCoinShuffle can enhance the privacy protection while maintaining performance."

    "abstract": "Behavioral biometrics is an emerging field that uses unique human interaction patterns, such as typing rhythms, gaits, and mouse movements, to enhance identity verification and security systems. A 2024 report by Yubico revealed that $54 \\%$ of respondents still rely on username and password combinations for their work accounts, with $39 \\%$ considering them the most secure form of authentication. This reliance persists despite the growing sophistication of cyberattacks exploiting these methods. The financial impact of such vulnerabilities is significant. In 2023, Ireland experienced €126 million worth of fraudulent payments, marking a 26% increase from the previous year. This rise is attributed to increasingly sophisticated methods fraudsters employ to bypass security systems and exploit digital marketplaces. This surge underscores the limitations of traditional authentication methods in the face of evolving cyber threats and hence proves the need for a new proficient method for enhancing security. This paper revolves around analyzing gait-based biometric authentication using the WISDM dataset. This is a type of biometric system that uses an individual’s walking pattern as a means of verifying their identity. Various machine learning models are applied to analyze gait patterns, and their performance is compared to determine the most effective approach. Random Forest was determined to be the most efficient, accurate, and precise gait identification system during the comparative examination, with 0.8941 testing accuracy."

A three-channel system with identical spacing is taken into consideration. Three distinct wavelengths 1.4 μm, 1.55 μm and 1.6 μm are taken into account, and the output is analyzed using FFT and electric field distribution. The result is examined for different relative permittivity values of the nonlinear Kerr materials while taking into account the transverse electric field. The findings indicate that when the relative permittivity increases, the peak value of electric field increases. Furthermore, as the nonlinear Kerr material's relative permittivity rises, the concentration of high amplitude frequency components increases. In the context of four wave mixing, this work will be helpful in creating a framework that can serve as a guide for choosing nonlinear materials with particular relative permittivity values in order to maximize the performance of WDM systems."

The implementation of stable features for broad changes in hand gestures remains a challenging task to achieve effectively. The latest CNN network allows automatic feature extraction from video data allowing direct learning of discriminative spatial-temporal features without manual human-designed features. Multiple video streams including colour information, depth clue and body joint location data are input to the CNN for creating combined colour, depth and trajectory information.

For this purpose, a two-stage multi-objective scheduling approach that integrates the economic interests of EV aggregators, the operational requirements of the DNO, and the monetary concerns of EV owners is proposed. In the first stage, EVs are scheduled to minimize the overall charging costs. In the second stage, EVs are rescheduled with the goal of reducing network losses and maximizing the profit of EV aggregator, while ensuring that the total charging cost does not exceed the optimal value determined in the first stage. The multi-objective problem of the second stage is solved using weighted-sum method.

Despite the continued complexity of spotting manipulated content, the study stresses the importance of localizing detection methods for languages that are often overlooked. The obtained outcomes stress the necessity of designing AI systems that account for linguistic and cultural nuances, particularly in regions with limited access to verification resources. By training models on Arabic-specific facial expressions and lipsync patterns, the developed system showcases how detection capabilities can be optimized for local environments. Expanding upon this research, our next steps entail broadening the Arabic dialect spectrum represented within the dataset. Simultaneously, incorporating audio-visual components is expected to improve recall performance.

This work proposes a joint deception-based anti-jamming framework that integrates pseudo secondary users (PSUs) with a non-cooperative game model of rate adaptation and frequency hopping. The interaction between secondary users (SUs) and an adaptive jammer is formulated as a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE), where the SU's utility function incorporates both channel capacity and risk-aversion, and the jammer optimizes disruption by targeting high-capacity channels. Closed-form equilibrium strategies are derived, showing that SUs probabilistically avoid high-risk channels, while PSUs increase the jammer's attraction probability, diverting attacks away from genuine users. Simulation results demonstrate that higher PSU attraction probabilities (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\delta_{p}= 0.7-0.9$</tex>) significantly reduce jamming probability across risk-aversion levels, enabling SUs to exploit high-capacity channels with improved robustness."

This research paper presents the Secretary Bird Optimisation Algorithm (SBOA), which is used to reconfigure solar PV arrays. The SBOA is a nature-inspired meta-heuristic formulated on the unique hunting and survival habits of the secretary bird. By means of the powerful global search ability of SBOA, the complex nonlinear programming problem for the reconfiguration of the PV array can be solved without falling into local optima. In order to enhance power extraction and minimize mismatch losses, the proposed technique meticulously optimizes the PV module configuration. Simulations are carried out under standard and various shaded patterns. The proposed SBOA was compared with two popular algorithms, the particle swarm Optimisation (PSO) and the TCT-linked scheme. It is obvious from the data that SBOA outperforms the TCT, discharging 8.7% (TCT) and $\\mathbf{6. 3 \\%}$ (PSO) more power in severe shading scenarios. SBOA also shows better stability and quicker convergence, suggesting its availability in real-time implementation. This work also shows that SBOA is a new and possible Optimisation method for increasing the energy efficiency of PV systems, particularly under environmental varying conditions."

    "abstract": "Ensuring the reliability of machine learning models requires that new data aligns with the assumptions made during training. Model predictions become less trustworthy when incoming data deviates from the original distribution. This paper introduces conformance constraints, a data profiling method that quantifies the degree of deviation and helps to assess when model inferences should not be trusted. Unlike traditional approaches such as functional dependencies and denial constraints, conformance constraints focus on numerical attributes and leverage low-variance components from principal component analysis (PCA) to establish stronger constraints. Furthermore, a scalable technique is proposed for efficiently discovering these constraints, growing linearly with data size and cubically with the number of attributes. Additionally, to evaluate the impact, a quantitative measure of non-conformance is introduced, aiding in applications such as trusted machine learning for identifying unreliable predictions and data drift detection for monitoring distributional shifts more accurately than existing methods. Moreover, the evaluation results demonstrate that conformance constraints enhance both the explainability and trustworthiness of machine learning models by providing a structured way to detect unreliable inferences and track data variations over time."

By building a hierarchical system architecture, integrating SLAM mapping, global and local path planning, dynamic obstacle avoidance and real-time replanning modules, the robot can achieve efficient autonomous inspection in complex power scenarios. In this paper, a typical substation simulation environment was constructed on the ROS and Gazebo platforms, and multiple groups of navigation experiments were conducted. A quantitative comparative analysis was conducted with the traditional path planning algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the traditional scheme in terms of path length, navigation time, obstacle avoidance success rate and replanning response time, and has good real-time and robustness. Some functions were verified in the actual substation sample area, further proving that the system has engineering application potential."

We discuss defensive strategies that involve Zero Trust models, such as AI-based policy enforcement and micro-segmentation, and emphasize mitigation techniques like adversarial training, data sanitization, ensemble learning, and continuous retraining of the model in CI/CD pipelines. Our discussion also emphasizes AI-powered cyber resilience capabilities, such as automated threat identification, rapid response, and self-healing, that minimize downtime and ensure compliance in multi-tenant cloud environments. The resulting framework provides actionable guidelines for developing stable, AI-enabled network automation solutions that can withstand sophisticated adversarial attacks in today's SaaS implementations.

When integrating such models into aeronautical applications, a top-down safety assessment process must influence both the model performance metrics selected, and their acceptable range of values. Often, however, the relationship of system safety objectives to model performance requirements and the associated metrics is unclear. Using an example of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt component (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first describes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior. Then, based on that abstraction, an initial method is given to derive the minimum safety-related performance requirements, the associated metrics, and their targets for the both MLC and its underlying deep neural network, such that they meet the quantitative safety objectives obtained from the safety assessment process. We give rationale as to why the proposed method should be considered valid, also clarifying the assumptions made, the constraints on applicability, and the implications for verification.

    "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) has become an increasingly popular medium across gaming, education, and healthcare. However, users often experience VR differently depending on personal and situational factors, making the concept of \"immersion\" highly subjective and difficult to measure. This study proposes a machine learning-based approach to predict user immersion levels using basic user and session data. We collected a public dataset from Kaggle consisting of 1000 VR users, with features such as age, gender, headset type, session duration, and motion sickness feedback. After preprocessing, we trained several baseline models including KNN, Random Forest, GBDT, SVM, and ANN. GBDT and KNN showed the strongest individual performance and were used to build an ensemble model based on predicted probabilities. SHAP analysis was applied to the best-performing model (GBDT) to interpret feature importance. Results show that the ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score, and SHAP revealed that gender, headset type, and motion sickness are the most influential features. Our approach offers a data-driven method to estimate user immersion in VR, enabling potential applications in adaptive VR content delivery and personalized design."

    "abstract": "In order to improve the perception ability of human-computer interaction systems on users' emotional states, this paper proposes a multimodal emotion recognition system based on deep neural networks. The system integrates three types of modalities: facial images, voice intonation, and physiological signals. It uses CNN, Bi-LSTM, and MLP for feature extraction respectively, and completes feature fusion through the attention mechanism. In the sentiment classification stage, a two-layer fully connected structure is constructed and combined with softmax to output sentiment labels. The experiment is based on the SEMAINE dataset, and the evaluation results show that the system is significantly better than traditional methods in terms of accuracy, F1-score and robustness. In human-computer interaction scenarios, the system demonstrates good real-time responsiveness and user satisfaction, and has broad application potential. This research provides technical support for building efficient and natural intelligent interaction systems, and also provides a feasible path for multimodal emotion understanding."

This design integrates the conventional quadratic boost converter with an additional boost module, leveraging its benefits including continuous input current. Due to its continuous input current and Enhanced voltage gain, the suggested converter is especially well-suited for solar photovoltaic systems and fuel cells. The modified quadratic boost converter (MQBC) attains an Enhanced voltage gain compared to other recently introduced converters that feature two controlled switches and the conventional quadratic boost converter. The analysis of voltage gain is conducted in continuous conduction mode (CCM), which takes into account the non-ideal characteristics of passive components and semiconductor devices in the MQBC. In addition, the selection of semiconductor devices and the design of reactive components according to voltage and current ratings are described in detail. The results of numerical simulation validate the suitability of the MQBC and support its theoretical foundations. Power electronics play a crucial role in renewable energy harvesting by enabling efficient conversion, control, and distribution of power generated from various renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and fuel cells."

    "abstract": "Soft robotic operation is a significant trend in daily life and industrial fields. However, soft manipulators are prone to failure during long-term operation under complex working conditions. This paper proposes a novel scheme merging with knowledge intelligent and fault-tolerant control into an alterable grasp configuration soft gripper (AGCSG). Firstly, a knowledge intelligent fault-tolerant soft robotic operation (KIFTSRO) framework with failure detection, knowledge reasoning, and fault-tolerant control is constructed. Next, the available gripper combinations are inferred from all the grasp configurations and different failure cases, and a progressive failure detection strategy is designed to assert the failure cases of sensing modules, and actuation modules as sensing modules are intact or failed. Then, a fault-tolerant soft robotic operation knowledge graph (FTSROKG) with dual input layers is designed to achieve available gripper combination reasoning with ACNet-ConvE algorithm. Finally, the UR5 robot guides the AGCSG to perform complex tasks under the fault-tolerant control scheme. The experimental results reveal that failure detection can be achieved regardless of whether the sensing modules are available or have failed. Moreover, the AGCSG can perform fault-tolerant grasping for different objects with different shapes and hardness, and accomplishes complex tasks including mobile phone charging, tea brewing, kitchen items organizing, daily objects sorting, and items arranging."

We propose a novel Target Speaker Speech-Image Retrieval task and a framework that learns the relationship between images and multi-speaker speech signals in the presence of a target speaker. Our method integrates pre-trained self-supervised audio encoders with vision models via target speaker-aware contrastive learning, conditioned on a Target Speaker Retrieval Extractor (TSRE) module. This method enables the extraction of semantic content from the target speaker's speech and aligns it with images representing the corresponding semantic meaning. Experiments on SpokenCOCO2Mix and SpokenCOCO3Mix show that TSRE significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 36.3% and 29.9% Recall@1 in 2- and 3-speaker scenarios, respectively-substantial improvements over single-speaker baselines and state-of-the-art models. Our approach demonstrates potential for real-world deployment in assistive robotics and multimodal interaction systems."

    "abstract": "Automatic spoken dialect identification (DID) is a challenging task as dialects of a given language have high similarities. Lack of sufficient training data to train deep learning (DL) based DID systems, which is common for low-resource languages like Romanian, makes it further challenging. While transfer-learning can be used to improve the performance in such low-resource conditions, it is not a trivial task to select a pre-trained model and a suitable layer for DID-specific feature extraction, as the ability to encode DID-specific content vary largely across models and their layers. Furthermore, due to high inter-class similarities, the features obtained from such pre-trained models may contain only limited dialect-discriminability, necessitating explicit methods to improve the discriminability of the learned features. Motivated by all these, we propose different methods to build efficient DID systems for identifying Romanian dialects, in low-resource settings. Specifically, we first explore pre-trained models like wav2vec2, HuBERT and XEUS for Romanian DID along with determining their optimum layer for this task. Furthermore, to address the performance degradation due to high inter-class similarities and intra-class variations, we employ metric learning techniques like center loss (CL) and centroid similarity loss (CSL). Obtained results indicate that DID system trained using 4<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>th</i></sup> layer of XEUS model, when combined with CSL gives the best performance on Romanian DID."

To enhance the therapeutic effects of facial masks, many additives are used, which inevitably leads to a series of problems, such as safety issues. Therefore, we proposed an efficient and safe antimicrobial plasma-activated hydrogel mask (PAHM). PAHM combines a plasma-activated ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer hydrogel (PAAH) and a plasma-activated mask substrate (PAMS). The plasma produced liquid-phase reactive species in PAAH which disrupted the cross-linking structure but had highly effective and short-term sterilizing effects. While plasma etching of cotton fibers can produce reactive functional groups, and PAMS has a long-term antimicrobial effect. Moreover, PAAH can load uniformly on PAMS and prevent water evaporation. The synergistic effect of them enhances the effectiveness and duration of PAHM. In vitro studies revealed that PAHM could kill more than 99.99% of S. aureus and P. acnes, and is effective for more than a week. In vivo experiments revealed that PAHM could effectively treat acne symptoms, inhibit the expression of inflammatory factors and reduce epidermal layer thickness without significant irritation. This work presents a novel approach to plasma application and, which has great potential for cosmetic and dermatological treatments and other applications."

These studies mainly transfer the inherent motion patterns from the source videos to the edited ones, where they often produce inferior results with inconsistency to user intentions, especially when shape changes between the edited and original objects might occur, due to the lack of particular alignments between the delivered motions and edited content. To address this limitation, we present a shape-consistent video editing method, namely StableV2V. Our method decomposes the entire editing pipeline into several sequential procedures, where we first edit the initial video frame, then simulate the shape-aware alignment between the delivered motions and edited sequence, and propagate the edited content to all other frames based on such alignment. Furthermore, we curate a testing benchmark, namely DAVIS-Edit, to offer a comprehensive evaluation of video editing, considering various types of prompts and difficulties. Experimental results and analyses illustrate the superior performance, visual consistency, and inference efficiency of our proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art video editing studies."

This proposed adaptive thermal management framework utilizes the previously developed online prediction algorithm to accurately model the thermal effects of IMDs, informed by data from spatially distributed heat sensors. The improvements in our approach are validated through both COMSOL software simulations and an in vitro experimental system. Results demonstrate that the proposed thermal management framework achieves higher power levels while preventing the risk of tissue overheating compared with the state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "High-speed imaging, which captures the fleeting dynamics of moving objects at extreme frame rates, has become an indispensable tool across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Yet, the pursuit of high temporal resolution often comes at the cost of significant image degradation, due to the inherent limitations of imaging sensors and the extreme conditions of ultra-short exposure and massive data throughput. As a result, high-speed cameras often produce images marred by strong noise and severe color distortions. In this work, we propose a deep image signal processing (ISP) paradigm that enables high-speed cameras to maintain extremely high frame rates while achieving image quality comparable to that of digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras. To this end, we make two key contributions: 1) constructing RHID, the first large-scale real-world high-speed imaging ISP dataset, comprising 282,912 RAW images captured by high-speed cameras and corresponding sRGB images captured by DSLRs, featuring complex degradations intrinsic to high-speed acquisition; and 2) proposing a misalignment-robust ISP learning framework (MisISP), equipped with a prior mapper-guided image alignment module (PMIA) and a spectrum-guided weakly-aligned image supervisory loss, which effectively addresses inherent pixel misalignments caused by heterogeneous sensor characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our paradigm substantially advances the performance of existing deep ISP models for high-speed imaging, achieving remarkable improvements in noise suppression, brightness enhancement, and color preservation.

    "abstract": "Technologies such as intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-assisted free-space optics (FSO) systems, are capable of providing connectivity with varied bandwidth through flexibly allocating resources on a planer panel. This flexibility provides new opportunities in handling inter-rack traffic that is often unevenly distributed in space and time. In this paper, we explore a new type of resource allocation scheme by taking full advantage of this flexibility. The key ideas include: (1) dynamically divide the resource on the planar panel into two planes, such that the small and large flows can be handled separately; (2) in the plane serving small flows, use multi-hop routing with variable bandwidth connections to handle skewed traffic between source-destination pairs; (3) in the plane serving large flows, use direct links with variable bandwidth to schedule unevenly distributed demand. In essence, through flexible resource allocation in and between the two planes, this scheme is able to make more efficient use of resources. We theoretically analyze the capacities of the proposed scheme, where the effectiveness conditions and performance bounds for dynamic resource adaptation are derived and the traffic scheduling with flexible bandwidth in two planes is proved to be able to achieve constant factor approximation to the ideally optimal performance. We then propose a set of lightweight algorithms with performance guarantees in each of two planes, collectively called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FlexAlloc</i>, to realize the flexibility and adaptivity of the proposed scheme, and discuss an example of this scheme in the context of IRS-assisted FSO systems. Our simulation results show that <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FlexAlloc</i> exhibits significant superiority over existing schemes for unevenly distributed traffic at low computational complexity, and can reduce the average flow completion time by 56-81%."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a harmonic magnetic field balancing method to effectively reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems caused by the leakage magnetic field in electric vehicle (EV) wireless power transfer systems. As the power level increases for fast-speed wireless charging of EVs, specific harmonics may significantly exceed EMI standards, and multiple harmonics are more likely to approach EMI standards. The proposed method provides a resonant circuit design method that enables adjustment of harmonic current magnitude and phase. Through this, a balance in the magnitude and phase of the harmonic magnetic field is achieved, which effectively reduces specific problematic harmonics while also reducing overall harmonics. The proposed method was validated through simulations and experiments. The experiment results showed that the third, fifth, and seventh harmonics, which significantly exceed the EMI standards, were reduced by 21.66, 15.58, and 18.38 dB, respectively, while an overall reduction of harmonics was also achieved."

    "abstract": "Abstract-Motivated by technology licensing practices in emerging technology industries with high demand uncertainty, we investigate firms' production timing decisions and technology licensing strategies in a supply chain consisting of two original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and a common supplier. Both manufacturers source their key components from the common supplier, and the innovative manufacturer can license its quality-improving technology to the supplier. Considering the demand variability of quality-improving innovation, firms may adopt an ex-post production scheme (PS) to avoid market risk and choose an ex-ante production scheme (AS) to obtain market leadership. Our findings reveal that firms' production timing and technology licensing decisions depend on the demand variability and the market potential difference. Interestingly, if a low-quality manufacturer implements AS, the innovative manufacturer may benefit from AS under no licensing. However, neither firm will obtain more benefits if both implement AS under technology licensing. When the innovative manufacturer adopts AS and its competitor adopts PS, the technology licensing will hurt the common supplier. Technology licensing makes low-quality OEMs more cautious and prefer PS, while high-quality OEMs are more aggressive and prefer AS. Moreover, the innovative OEM and supplier can reach a technology licensing agreement when the difference in market potential is greater than a small threshold. The intensity of competition among two manufacturers will raise the threshold for technology licensing. The extended model of innovation costs and licensing fees verifies the robustness of production timing decisions and licensing strategy choices. Our study provides novel insights and contributes to the growing literature on technology licensing under demand uncertainty. licensing to the supplier may unintentionally reduce overall supply chain profit, especially when both OEMs choose AS. Managers of low-quality OEMs are advised to adopt ex-post production (PS) to hedge against market risk, especially when facing technology licensing. For suppliers, strategic acceptance or refusal of licensing contracts should be based on the specific combination of OEMs' timing strategies. Therefore, engineering leaders must jointly consider demand volatility, competition intensity, and partner behaviour to decide production timing that maximize long-term value across the supply chain."

    "abstract": "The Flight Centric Air Traffic Control (FCA) concept represents a paradigm shift from the conventional sector-based air traffic management approach which requires a high level of coordination and communication, and can lead to uneven workload distribution between sectors. FCA aims to address these challenges by eliminating sector boundaries and allowing multiple Air Traffic Control Officers (ATCOs) to work within the same airspace. Instead of being assigned to specific sectors, controllers are responsible for individual aircraft from entry to exit within the entire FCA airspace. This new approach promises significant benefits, including increased airspace capacity, longer lookahead time for conflict resolution, and efficient workload distribution among ATCOs, leading to a potential reduction in the number of required controllers and lower fuel consumption. The transition from a sector-based Air Traffic Control (ATC) system to the FCA concept fundamentally changes the tasks not only of the air traffic controllers, but of other roles such as the Supervisor, who traditionally oversees operations in an Area Control Center and assists controllers in managing challenging traffic situations. To define the role of the Supervisor in the FCA context, a dedicated workshop was conducted with Ukrainian air traffic controllers and Supervisors, as well as operational, safety and human performance experts. The workshop had three major goals. First, it aimed to explore how the Supervisor's general tasks and responsibilities change in FCA compared to a sector-based environment. Second, to assess the level of involvement of the Supervisors on FCA-specific operating procedures; finally, to determine which support tools are required to optimally carry out these tasks. The workshop discussions led to a clearer understanding of the impact of FCA on the Operational Supervisor. This paper summarizes the outcome of the discussions and describes the consensus reached by the group. In particular, one new task was identified, three required modifications, and two were considered obsolete. Participants also suggested that a new role might be required in FCA. Finally, three new tools or functions were discussed in some detail, and four might require major adaptations."

    "abstract": "With the growth of digital retail systems, supermarkets now generate large volumes of transactional data, offering opportunities to improve operational decisions through data-driven insights. However, traditional inventory models often treat items independently and fail to consider the interdependence of products commonly purchased together. This gap limits the ability of retailers to align procurement strategies with actual customer purchasing behaviors, especially in joint promotions or bundled sales scenarios. This study integrates association rule mining with an enhanced Newsvendor Model to improve joint procurement decisions for strongly associated product pairs in large supermarket settings. The co-purchase minimum is introduced as a proxy for bundled demand, representing the lower quantity sold when two items are purchased together. This value is used to model realistic paired demand, which traditional single-item inventory models often overlook. To account for seasonality and demand variability, rolling-window and seasonal segmentation techniques are applied during demand estimation. The proposed approach allows more accurate calculation of optimal order quantities, especially for items frequently sold together during promotional periods or holidays. Experimental results using real supermarket transaction data show that this method leads to higher service levels and a noticeable reduction in both overstocking and understocking risks compared to conventional models. The framework is practical, scalable, and well-suited for integration into retail decision-making systems."

    "abstract": "Polyetherimide (PEI)-based composites are widely employed in electronic and optoelectronic components owing to their excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength. In addition to achieving high transparency, these materials must also withstand diverse stresses to ensure long-term reliability. Zirconia, as a refractory ceramic, offers excellent mechanical and chemical stability, with the added potential of modifying optical behavior when incorporated into polymer matrices. In this study, zirconia nanofibers were synthesized via electrospinning of a polyacrylonitrile/zirconium precursor solution, followed by calcination, and subsequently dispersed within a PEI matrix. As the miniaturization of components drives the need to investigate and enhance the nanomechanical properties of materials, the PEI-zirconia composite exhibits notable improvements in crucial properties. Nanoindentation revealed enhancements of 10% in hardness and 14% in reduced modulus of elasticity at 3 wt% zirconia loading, while nanoscratch testing indicated higher resistance to plastic deformation and improved wear performance despite slightly increased friction coefficients. UV-Vis analysis demonstrated that neat PEI retained high transmittance in the visible range, whereas the addition of zirconia at 3 wt%, led to an acceptable reduction. These results highlight the potential of PEI-zirconia composites as multifunctional materials that balance optical clarity with mechanical reliability, supporting their application in advanced optoelectronic and structural systems."

The sensor is fabricated by splicing the two ends of the Bragg hollowcore fiber (BHCF) with the single mode fiber and the suspended core fiber (SCF) without the need for coatings or nanofabrication. The eccentric splicing of the SCF and BHCF establishes an efficient natural gas channel for photothermal detection while enhancing the reflective surface area, thereby improving the contrast of the FPI cavity. The sensor demonstrates high sensitivity for acetylene gas detection with a 1 mm ultra-short cavity length, achieving a noise equivalent concentration of 114 parts per billion (ppb) with a 300 ms locking time constant. This work makes rational use of the features of special microstructure optical fibers, overcoming the limitations in sensitivity associated with traditional short-cavity intrinsic optical fiber gas sensors. The advantages of this sensor include long-term stability, fast response time, a wide measurement range, and low production costs, paving the way for broader applications of optical fiber gas sensors."

Accurate forecasting of electricity carbon intensity is critical for supporting decarbonization efforts and optimizing low-carbon energy strategies. This study evaluated three machine learning methods and proposed the most suitable method for multi-day carbon intensity prediction, leveraging national-level data on the percentage of energy mix, electricity load, and weather conditions in China.

The SHAP analysis suggests the percentage of coal power is the dominant positive driver of carbon intensity, while wind power reveals the strongest mitigating effect. By employing percentage-based variables and lagged features to reduce reliance on absolute data, this study provides a transferable and replicable approach, especially for countries with limited data. Moreover, the achievement of multi-day forecasting encourages short-term response mechanisms for policymakers."

The primary goal is to maintain the stability in grid frequency despite uncertainties in the system's damping and inertia, which are mostly brought on by the influx of renewable energy sources. The concept of virtual inertia (VI) serves as the foundation for the technique used to achieve this goal. The creation of an automated tie-line power scheduling in the two-area microgrid is the second goal. To concurrently accomplish these goals, the proposed Type-II Fuzzy-TID controller is modelled optimally with suggesting an improved Smell-agent optimizer (i-SAO) under several operating scenarios. By using the suggested approach, the errors occurred in microgrid frequency and tie-line power are reduced drastically in addition to offsetting the negative effects of uncertainties and disruptions.

The study evaluates the effectiveness of Coulomb Counting, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and ML models in enhancing battery management system accuracy. Owing to the easy implementation and cost-effectiveness nature of CC predominantly used but suffers from accumulated errors over time. Moreover, the EKF provides better accuracy under system uncertainties, and the nonlinear characteristics of the battery, but its effectiveness depends on the precision of the battery model. Furthermore, the ML-based approach are capable of handling nonlinear characteristics, offering higher accuracy at the expense of computational complexity. The training data and comparative performance metrics are detailed in Table I, and II, respectively. The proposed model is validated using MATLAB/Simulink with a detailed equivalent circuit model of the battery. The outcomes highlight the effectiveness of numerous SoC estimation approaches with good accuracy and minimal error."

    "abstract": "When System-on-Chip (SoC) projects move from concept to implementation, design intent is usually written in plain language by senior architects and then interpreted by several downstream teams. In practice, that hand-off is errorprone: small omissions or wording shifts “micro-anomalies” propagate into RTL code, where they become costly late-stage bugs. We present a verification pipeline that tackles the problem at its linguistic source. A first Large Language Model (LLM) layer converts free-form requirements into concrete artifacts such as module lists, interface definitions, and schematic fragments. A second LLM layer then validates every artifact against a knowledge base that combines relational tables, semantic embeddings, and historical metrics. Detected inconsistencies trigger an automatic feedback loop that refines the artifacts until they align with the stored golden specifications. Experiments across ten representative SoC subsystems show that the framework identifies $95 \\%$ of requirement deviations versus $85 \\%$ for a simulation only baseline and shortens verification turnaround by $33 \\%$. In a case study on a 12-bit $250 \\mathrm{MS} / \\mathrm{s}$ ADC, the system uncovered twelve timing violations five missed by conventional flows while halving manual review effort. Engineers reported clearer traceability and faster convergence when requirements changed mid-project.These results indicate that language-aware, database backed reasoning can shift verification from a postdesign activity to a continuous, intent-preserving process, improving both reliability and schedule predictability for complex SoC developments."

The SMC switching law is formulated using frequency deviation as the primary control input for both the single-area power system and the EV system. The stability of the proposed control approach is ensured through the Lyapunov stability theorem, guaranteeing asymptotic convergence. The effectiveness of the SMC strategy is evaluated through MATLAB simulations under three different operating conditions: step load demand, random load demand, and a short-term EV power outage. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SMC scheme significantly improves frequency regulation by minimizing overshoot, undershoot, and settling time, even under system uncertainties caused by load and wind power variations. By utilizing EV flexibility, the proposed control method enhances grid stability and robustness towards frequency deviations."

Conventional passive blind forensic methods often exhibit elevated false detection rates in complex scenarios due to illumination variations, compression artifacts, and texture interference, particularly demonstrating insufficient sensitivity to spliced edges after blurring operations. This paper proposes a novel blind detection framework leveraging physical consistency verification, which integrates multi-channel noise analysis with an adaptive decision-making mechanism. The core workflow involves independently quantifying noise distribution characteristics in three channels of RGB to construct cross-channel noise synergy metrics for capturing device-source discrepancies in tampered regions; Employing dynamic threshold segmentation to enhance detection sensitivity for faint traces; Achieving pixel-level localization through morphological refinement. The proposed solution effectively addresses limitations of traditional methods in challenging scenarios such as low illumination and high texture complexity. Experimental validation on the UCID dataset demonstrates a precision of 79.75, providing new insights for image forensics in complex environments."

While the increasing number of satellites from multi-constellation GNSS enhances signal availability and possibly positioning accuracy, the presence of degraded signals can significantly deteriorate performance. In general, removing available signals from position calculation may increase the level of dilution of precision (DOP). This study proposes machine learning-aided satellite selection techniques that can identify and exclude low-quality signals while maintaining the DOP level. Several signal quality indicators are employed as input features to train ensemble learning algorithms. Based on the predicted scores from the machine learning output, novel satellite selection criteria are employed to exclude low-quality signals. Experimental results using measurement based realworld urban datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces positioning errors in both single and multiconstellation cases compared to least squares positioning using all available satellites.

    "abstract": "In dynamic environments such as intelligent transportation systems, autonomous vehicle navigation, and wireless communication networks, the ability to discover and adapt optimal routes in real-time is crucial. Traditional routing approaches often fall short when confronted with rapid changes in network topology, fluctuating traffic loads, or varying environmental constraints. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel adaptive routing framework grounded in bio-inspired swarm intelligence principles. Drawing inspiration from the collective behavior of natural systems such as ant colonies and bird flocks, the proposed methodology integrates the strengths of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) into a unified hybrid model. ACO offers exploration capabilities through pheromonebased feedback, while PSO contributes fast convergence by adjusting particle positions and velocities in the solution space. The hybrid algorithm dynamically balances exploitation and exploration to efficiently identify optimal or near-optimal paths in complex, changing environments. Mathematical models were formulated to govern pheromone evaporation, velocity updates, and probabilistic decision-making processes. The system was implemented and tested using a simulated network graph with varying levels of environmental dynamics, including congestion and node failure scenarios. Performance evaluation was conducted by comparing the proposed model against standard ACO, PSO, and Dijkstra's algorithm across metrics such as convergence speed, route stability, energy efficiency, and load distribution. Experimental results indicate that the hybrid swarm approach significantly outperforms existing models in terms of adaptability, reliability, and computational efficiency, especially in highly volatile conditions. Furthermore, the proposed method maintains lower energy consumption and better load balancing across network paths. This research highlights the potential of biologically inspired mechanisms in addressing complex optimization challenges and lays the groundwork for future development in real-time, intelligent routing systems for smart infrastructures and autonomous platforms."

This problem is a major challenge in the NGNM (Next Generation Networks Management) field. It is an optimization problem in the strong sense with resource constraints in the context of real-time reconfiguration systems. It is also related to the operability of distributed highavailability systems used in NGN communications networks (full IPv4, full IPv6, MPLS/IMS, VoIP/IPTV, FTTx/PON, Virtualization, Cloud Computing, Green Computing, 3G/4G/5G/6G, Edge Computing, WSN, VR/AR, and IoT) as well as AI (Artificial Intelligent) infrastructures. The resolution of such problems requires a significant and simultaneous reduction of several performance temporal criteria. The reduction of the execution durations allows optimizing performances of networks resources. From a practical point of view, the reduction of network resources consumption automatically decreases the overall energy consumption in the network. We propose thus an algorithm capable of determining and decreasing in real time the execution durations. This algorithm is based on minimal temporal criteria, lower and upper bounds, dominance rules, a branching scheme and an exploration strategy. Our experiments show that the results of the proposed algorithm are more efficient than those of the existing reference algorithms."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of smart grid construction, automated meter reading (AMR) technology, through the collaboration of smart meters, concentrators, and master station systems, realizes real-time collection and transmission of electrical energy data, significantly improving the operational efficiency of power supply enterprises. As a critical support for the intelligent management of power systems, the accuracy of AMR directly impacts the efficiency of electricity billing and user service quality. However, issues such as equipment aging, environmental interference, and human operation errors have caused the AMR accuracy in some regions to consistently fall below industry standards. Frequent meter reading errors not only trigger billing disputes but also increase operation and maintenance costs. Therefore, improving AMR accuracy has become a research hotspot in the current power industry. In this context, this study systematically analyzes the root causes of AMR anomalies through data statistics, fault diagnosis, and technical optimization. It identifies loose wiring in smart meters and meter-account mismatches as the primary influencing factors. By developing a portable bendable shim to optimize the wiring device and constructing a remote cross-connection detection model, the research ultimately increases the accuracy rate to 98.89%, yielding significant economic benefits. The findings provide reusable technical and management solutions for power enterprises to enhance meter reading efficiency and power supply reliability."

    "abstract": "As the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) grows in various nations, more experts are concentrating on problems pertaining to EV Charging Stations (EVCS). Only taking Distribution Networks (DNs) into account while designing EVCS optimally is not a reliable method. Additionally, the EVCS site must be suitable for the EV user within a specific EV driving range, considering the DN’s efficiency. The optimum model of EVCS and Distributed Generators (DG) in a DN connected to a Transportation Network (TN) is examined in this research. The suggested optimal planning approach seeks to minimize voltage variance, EV driving cost, and active power loss for efficient EVCS and DG planning. The distance between the demand region and EVCS region is determined using Bellman-Ford algorithm. The test system is a 25-node TN overlayed with an IEEE 33 bus and 69 bus DN. For optimization, the modified hybrid WTLBO-PSO method is used, and the outcomes are contrasted with those of the PSO algorithm."

    "abstract": "Classification of medical images is a difficult, time-consuming and error-prone activity that demands for comprehensive subject knowledge. An approach is crucial for automatically classifying medical images. This study suggests unique Deep Learning systems to identify and categorize Epithelial ovarian cancer based on Histopathological images. Epithelial carcinoma, the type of ovarian cancer that is most prevalent, starts in the tissue surrounding the ovaries. The most prevalent sub-type of ovarian cancer, known as highgrade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), frequently spreads without being noticed. To enhance patient care and longevity, this research attempts to classify the five different categories of Epithelial Ovarian cancer. This study uses a set of 4100 histopathology images, separated into training and validation subsets required to train the ResNet 50, VGG19 and DenseNet121 Deep Learning Models. Remarkably, the model's accuracy was 87% for the VGG19, 96 % for the ResNet 50 and 73 % for the DenseNet 121 model. This work is significant in overcoming the difficulties of the human expert assessment, including increased misinterpretation rates and lengthy analysis periods."

As an example of using a recursive solution method, we evaluated the performance of for a recursive implementation of the traveling salesman problem using the brute force method, and found that Julia is much slower than C, which uses a stack, because it acquires memory for each function call. Therefore, it is expected that reducing the number of function calls by converting function calls into a for loop will lead to speedup."

In this paper, we propose a robust communication framework combining a Spider Webinspired network topology with an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-based routing algorithm. Unlike traditional star-topology systems that are prone to central node failures, the spider web model offers decentralized, redundant paths for resilient data transmission. Our ACO-based algorithm dynamically selects optimal communication paths by mimicking pheromone-based path selection, effectively reducing latency and offline error rates. We evaluate the system on parameters such as communication success rate, latency distribution, and redundancy. Results show a significant increase in success rate and reduced latency compared to baseline methods. This hybrid approach demonstrates scalability, adaptability, and robustness for real-time vehicular networks, paving the way for safer and more reliable platooning systems."

    "abstract": "Brain tumor (BT) is one of the most aggressive and life-threatening cancers, necessitating accurate and efficient detection for timely medical intervention. Conventional techniques typically rely on a single classifier for BT detection. However, single classifiers operate with a fixed decision boundary, which may not be optimal for complex datasets. This limitation often results in poor generalization across different data distributions, leading to suboptimal performance on unseen samples. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel ensemble machine learning model that incorporates contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for enhanced BT classification. Our methodology utilizes a publicly available Kaggle dataset, with preprocessing steps including CLAHE for contrast enhancement, Otsu thresholding for image binarization, and median filtering for noise reduction. A minimal yet effective set of features is extracted to improve classification efficiency while maintaining high performance. The ensemble model combines random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM) using a hard voting mechanism, achieving an accuracy of $90 \\%$ without requiring data augmentation. The model operates with a computational time of 5.17 seconds, and ROC curve analysis yields an AUC of 0.91, demonstrating its robustness and reliability. Additionally, K-means segmentation is applied post-classification for precise tumor localization. This study highlights the effectiveness of ensemble learning for BT classification, particularly in scenarios where manual labeling and data augmentation are challenging for medical professionals. The proposed approach offers a computationally efficient, accurate, and practical solution for real-time medical diagnostics."

In this paper, we highlight this critical limitation, and propose a method which enables the vehicles to update their local authentication databases independently from infrastructure availability. Our approach aim to allow vehicles to perform V2V authentication using locally stored data, in order to ensure continuity of secure communications even when disconnected from the Infrastructure. We further analyze the probability of successful authentication under two scenarios, which are the first with up-to-date databases, and the second with outdated ones. The analytical results show that the authentication probability decreases to below <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{7 5 \\%}$</tex> after <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{3 0}$</tex> hours of disconnection with long-lived certificates, while updates keep it above 90% in highway scenarios, even with short-lived certificates.

Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to pre-filter lowquality face images before they are passed to the verification pipeline. Our approach utilizes normalized facial landmarks in conjunction with a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an accuracy of 96.67 %. By integrating this quality assessment module into the face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance, including a 99.7 % reduction in the false rejection rate and enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment techniques while maintaining computational efficiency."

Leveraging the individual advantages and strengths of both fundamentally different approaches, we use a movement detector based on classical image processing methods alongside the already implemented machine learning (ML)-based object detector. Using image processing techniques such as feature detectors, optical flow, filtering, and clustering, the movement detector isolates true moving features from the also moving background in the scene and provides measurements usable in our data fusion stage. Using data collected with a manned ultralight aircraft equipped with a state-of-the-art surveillance sensor, we verify and explore the envelope of the integrated system in flight."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an enterprise bankruptcy prediction model based on hierarchical graph neural networks. By collaboratively integrating the internal attributes of enterprises and the external correlation characteristics, the prediction performance and interpretability are significantly improved. The model innovatively combines the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the Multi-head Graph Attention Mechanism (GAT). Among them, the GCN module extracts the inherent features of enterprises through two-layer convolution operations, and the GAT module dynamically models the influence of the correlation network using four attention heads, and designs a gated fusion mechanism to adaptively adjust the feature weights. The experimental results show that the model achieves an accuracy rate of 0.91 and an F1 value of 0.85 on the dataset of A-share listed companies, which is 8.97% higher than the traditional XGBoost method. Moreover, in A high-noise environment with σ=0.3, F1 only decreases by 6.8%, demonstrating excellent robustness. Although there is room for improvement in computational efficiency, its innovative multi-perspective feature fusion architecture not only achieves precise prediction but also identifies key risk transmission paths through attention weights, providing reliable support for financial risk control decisions."

Despite their historical value, many of these architectural wonders remain overlooked due to limited digital documentation, language barriers, and a lack of informative tools for tourists. To address this, the paper propose an intelligent, image-based recognition system tailored for Bishnupur’s architectures. Tourists can capture or upload a photo of any site to instantly receive its name, historical background, geolocation, and recommendations for nearby attractions with google map locations. The system utilizes preprocessing techniques and a custom-trained CNN enhanced with data augmentation to ensure reliable classification from limited image data. By combining visual recognition with cultural storytelling and location-aware features, our model promotes equitable tourism, enhances visitor experience, and contributes to the sustainable digital preservation of Bishnupur’s rich architectural legacy."

    "abstract": "Cloud storage provides unlimited data storage space, convenient and secure access to files, efficient data management, offsite backup capabilities, and cost-effective usage. However, dependence on a single Cloud Storage Provider ($CSP$) introduces challenges such as vendor lock-in, security vulnerabilities, and cost-related issues. Multi-Cloud Storage ($MCS$) provides strategic solutions to these issues by distributing data across different $CSP_{s}$ but suffers from data integrity, availability, and verifiability issues in the absence of trustworthy ThirdParty Auditors ($TPA_{s}$). To address trust issues among entities, blockchain-enabled solutions store metadata of data chunks directly on the blockchain, resulting in scalability challenges. The proposed model integrates blockchain with the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) to provide a secure and scalable data integrity verification approach for MCS environments. Secure storage of metadata in IPFS improves scalability while effectively detecting malicious CSP in the event of data modification. Experimental results show that the solution is both cost- and storage-efficient, while security vulnerability assessments confirm that the deployed smart contracts are free from vulnerabilities."

    "abstract": "The extraction, summarization, and retrieval of knowledge from video content is a significant challenge due to the multimodal, unstructured, and temporally dispersed nature of information within videos. This paper presents a novel framework that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector database indexing for efficient and accurate video-based knowledge access. The system extracts transcripts from YouTube videos, segments them into temporally-aligned chunks, and embeds these chunks using Sentence-Transformer models into high-dimensional vector space. These embeddings are stored in a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone) to enable low-latency similarity search. The framework includes an abstractive summarization module powered by ChatGPT to provide a high-level overview of the video content. Additionally, natural language queries are encoded, matched against the embedded transcript segments, and passed to ChatGPT for refined, context-aware answers with corresponding timestamps. This architecture enables users to navigate video content efficiently and interactively. Experimental results on a curated dataset of educational YouTube videos demonstrate that our system outperforms conventional baselines. It achieves a ROUGE-L score of 43.2 (vs. 35.7 using BART-CNN) and an MRR of 0.84 (vs. 0.67 using direct GPT-4). Furthermore, response latency is reduced by over $30 \\%$ due to precomputed embedding vectors. This study confirms the effectiveness of combining RAG and vector search for timestamped video content summarization and retrieval. Future work will explore multimodal fusion techniques and domain-specific embedding fine-tuning."

In code-capacity simulations at code distances 3, 5, and 7, the GNN achieves consistently lower logical error rates than MWPM across the tested range of pair-error probabilities. The GNN correction threshold is about 2.5%, surpassing the 2.4% achieved by the MWPM baseline. These results indicate that data-driven message passing can adapt to complex, geometry-dependent noise without hand-crafted correlation models, thereby reducing reliance on manual model specification for quantum error correction."

However, existing interactive games often face problems such as insufficient interaction depth, fragmented narratives, and poor immersion, which limit the player's experience. To address this challenge, this study takes the immersive interactive game \"Identity: Unknown\" developed with the Unity3D engine as the research object, focusing on the optimization effect of interaction design on the player's immersion. By constructing a narrative framework centered on \"a protagonist with amnesia exploring a closed room\", core modules such as environmental physical interaction, multi-step item triggering, dynamic audio-visual effects, and exploratory plot were realized. The study innovatively adopted environmental narrative techniques (such as connecting the plot through interactive music players, tapes, cameras, etc.), and designed a control experiment to verify the effectiveness of interaction design: inviting 20 players to participate in two sets of control tests (simplified interaction version vs complete interaction version), and conducting quantitative analysis of satisfaction ratings. The results show that the optimized interaction design (such as layered sound effects, dynamic lighting, multi-step item interaction) significantly improved immersion scores, narrative coherence, and operational smoothness, proving that refined interaction elements can effectively enhance the immersive experience of the game. This study provides a quantifiable optimization path for interactive game design."

For successful Load Frequency Control (LFC), it is essential to have precisely adjusted controllers that can minimize frequency fluctuations, including both overshoots and undershoots, as well as reduce the settling time. To mitigate frequency deviations and enhance the performance of a two-area power system, a Proportional-Integrative-Derivative (PID) controller optimized using Adaptive Exponential Particle Swarm Optimization (AEPSO) is proposed. The analysis involves a two-area interconnected hybrid power system, which includes thermal, nuclear, hydro, and wind turbines while taking into account physical limitations such as generation rate constraints (GRC) and governor dead band (GDB). The proposed controller's performance is compared with a linear PSO-optimized PID controller under a range of load conditions. Simulation results show that, compared to the linear approach commonly used in existing literature, the proposed control method yields substantial improvements in all areas."

    "abstract": "Civil aviation has a significant impact on climate change, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from this sector is a critical goal. One promising approach to mitigating emissions is the use of wake vortex uplift in formation flying. Initial tests by test pilots have demonstrated the general feasibility of this maneuver. However, for the execution of formation flying, the current safety separation distances between aircraft, as defined by ICAO, must be temporarily suspended. The current separation distances are designed for collision avoidance and specifically to mitigate risks associated with wake turbulence, which can pose significant dangers to aircraft, crew, and passengers. To integrate formation flying into routine civil aviation operations, new procedures are required. These procedures must ensure the efficient utilization of wake vortex effects in formation flying while maintaining current safety standards. Currently, no such procedures exist. We propose a six-phase procedure to address the absence of such protocols and identify key challenges that must be overcome to enable the safe and efficient use of wake vortices in formation flying. The proposed procedure requires only minimal modifications to existing ICAO regulations, making it feasible for rapid integration into current air traffic management systems. Our solution involves several key components: sharing and negotiating adjusted flight plans, utilizing and fusing multiple types of sensors during the flight, and sharing the data collected by these sensors. For effective communication of flight plans, a high-throughput air-to-ground datalink is necessary. Additionally, for using and real-time sharing sensor data, a secure, low-latency air-to-air data link between formation partners is required, a technology that is currently unavailable. We define specific requirements for these datalink systems at various stages of the proposed procedure using heuristic values to guide the design of the communication infrastructure. By combining the proposed formation flying phases, sensor fusion strategies, and the necessary data link requirements, we present a novel framework for integrating formation flying into civil aviation operations."

Integration of features extracted from sky images along with time-series data further improved model performance, especially for advanced methods like XGBoost, Optimized Random Forest, and the LSTM-GRU hybrid model. This study emphasizes the importance of temporal data integration and enhanced feature representations to enhance forecasting dependability. The results highlight how hybrid approaches may be used to tackle the challenges of solar irradiance forecasting, opening the door to more precise and effective renewable energy solutions."

The antenna is intended to have very wide frequency range of 1200 – 9400 MHz to suit the expanding demand for communication systems that should be in different frequency bands. The suggested antenna offers a low profile and a small size suitable for the current communication devices. For the desired broad banding, the design process involves fine tuning of critical parameters, which includes, ground dimensions, patch dimensions, substrate parameters, and feed configuration. Analysis of the performance of the antenna is done and checked with the help of electromagnetic simulation solvers called CST Were variables like S-parameters, radiation pattern was taken into consideration as well as Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR).These results show how effectively the designed antenna is able to cover entire 3.4GHz band with a stable and efficient radiation pattern over a wide bandwidth. This obtained bandwidth of 1.2 GHz to 9.4 GHz shows that the proposed antenna is suitable for wide frequency range operations like cognitive radio, satellite communication and wireless communication. Due to compact size and ease of installation they are suited to be installed in areas of limited space."

    "abstract": "Based on the prominent problems of grid node voltage over-limit and line overload risks under the background of large-scale access of clean power sources, and the poor economic efficiency of traditional expansion plans, this study aims to design a grid upgrade plan optimization method that takes into account economic cost and safety and stability. First, a multi-objective optimization model with the goals of minimizing the total upgrade cost, minimizing the node voltage deviation, and optimizing the line load balance is constructed. The constraints include node voltage safety limits, line capacity restrictions, and topological connectivity. Secondly, in view of the lack of convergence and distribution of the NSGA-II algorithm when solving high-dimensional power grid problems, an adaptive crossover mutation probability mechanism is introduced and the congestion calculation strategy is improved. Finally, a simulation scenario with a high proportion of distributed photovoltaic and wind power access is constructed based on the IEEE 33-node system, and the improved NSGA-II algorithm is used to coordinately optimize and solve the combination of transformer expansion, line capacity increase, and reactive compensation device site selection and capacity determination. While reducing the average total investment cost to 3.21 million yuan, the optimization scheme reduces the voltage over-limit rate to 1.72%, and the number of overloaded lines is reduced to 1 at the minimum. The proposed algorithm can effectively coordinate the economic and technical aspects of power grid upgrades, and provide a quantitative decision-making basis for the adaptive transformation of power grids with a high proportion of clean energy access."

This paper demonstrates the performance benchmarking results of the indigenously developed density-matrix-based quantum computing simulator QSim (qctoolkit.in). We have adopted a framework called “Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for Quantum Computing” for the benchmarking procedure and modified it for our cause.

External optical feedback represents the predominant configuration in laser diode chaos applications. However, various fixed external cavities introduce significant time delay signatures. The previously reported self-chaotic laser effectively addresses this issue; however, its utilization is limited due to the restricted number of output modes. In this paper, we propose a solitary chaotic comb source based on multimode interaction in a laser diode, providing 173 chaotic comb lines within a 100 nm spectral range, with a channel effective bandwidth of up to 8.4 GHz. The channels cross-correlation is consistently below 0.08, satisfying the orthogonality criteria. This scheme can generate an offline random number sequence with an expected data throughput of 32 Tbits/s and can resolve at least 256 multi-armed bandit issues. We have successfully opened a new way to develop low-cost, massively integrated, parallel chaotic comb sources, and this technology possesses the potential to revolutionize entire chaotic application systems."

    "abstract": "With the gradual maturity of deep learning technology and its extensive application in the field of remote sensing, hyperspectral image classification technology has made tremendous progress. The existing methods can achieve excellent classification performance in a closed-set environment (CSE), where the class distribution of the training and test set is consistent. However, in the open environment of the real world, many samples in the test set belong to the classes that never appear in the training set. Therefore, when unknown samples are present, existing closed-set classification methods will predict them as one of the known classes and cannot identify the unknown samples. Open Set Recognition (OSR) aims to solve this problem by simultaneously identifying unknown classes and distinguishing known classes. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction-enhanced prototype network (RePro) for HSI open-set classification. Specifically, the prototypes are constructed for each class in the embedding space, and the classification loss is also introduced to make the samples closer to the prototype of each class. Then the reconstruction loss based on <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub> is adopted to fully exploit the spectral-spatial information of training samples to provide the auxiliary information to identify the samples of unknown classes. Finally,the reconstruction loss and prototype distance are combined to identify samples of unknown classes. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

A min–max strategy and an off-policy homotopic Q-learning (HQ) scheme are then introduced to design a secure control policy without requiring knowledge of the system dynamics. The proposed approach offers two main advantages: it does not require an initial stabilizing control gain, and it guarantees unbiased learning under persistently excited conditions. Furthermore, a rigorous stability analysis of the overall closed-loop system under FDIAs is presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a tunnel diode circuit."

We study nonideal ISLs, focusing on terahertz (THz) and free-space optical (FSO) links with respect to ergodic capacity. A scenario based on the recent 3GPP standard specifies the frequency band, bandwidth, antenna gains, power levels, and channel characteristics for nonterrestrial networks. We also propose a satellite selection method to identify the optimal master node for signal processing, considering both the user–satellite link and ISL channels. For THz ISLs, we derive a closed-form capacity approximation under instantaneous or statistical channel state information, while for FSO ISLs, we present a closed-form approximate upper bound incorporating pointing error loss. We further assess the impact of ISL frequency and pointing errors on spectral efficiency. Simulations show that multisatellite multiple-input multiple-output communications significantly outperforms single-satellite systems, and that the proposed upper bound closely matches Monte Carlo results."

The proposed method offers a data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based modeling, supporting condition assessment and defect localization in high-voltage (HV) insulation systems.

    "abstract": "Although many researchers have found that EV adoption depends heavily on charging infrastructure, few studies have investigated whether and how additional public charging stations operating under the Pay-Per-Use (PPU) mode affect EV adoption. In this mode, consumers pay for usage but do not obtain ownership of the product. To fill this gap, we develop two theoretical models in which a manufacturer sells EVs and private charging piles, while an independent operator provides public charging stations via the PPU mode. We confirm that the entry of public charging stations improves EV adoption. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, our analysis reveals that, although the PPU mode reduces the optimal quantity of private charging piles, it may increase private charging piles' optimal prices and profits. Moreover, decreasing the operational costs of public charging stations benefits the manufacturer and consumers but may not always be profitable for the operator. To assess the robustness of our findings, we extend the models to two scenarios: including multiple EV manufacturers and considering consumer waiting at public charging stations. Besides confirming our main results, the extensions yield two additional findings: (i) As the number of manufacturers in the market increases, the operator's profits decrease. (ii) Consumer waiting costs, dependent on the proportion of public charging infrastructure, negatively affect the public charging and EV markets while benefiting the private charging pile market."

    "abstract": "The fusion of hyperspectral images (HSIs) and multispectral images (MSIs) has been widely focused in the field of remote sensing image processing. Traditional fusion approaches have no consideration of the topological consistency between the target high-resolution HSI (HR-HSI) and the input HSI/MSI. To remedy such deficiency, in this letter, we propose a novel topological consistency network (TCNet) for HSI and MSI fusion. Specifically, two degradation models are firstly constructed to form the spatial mapping between the input HSI and the target HR-HSI as well as the spectral mapping between the MSI and the HR-HSI. With this way, the basic observation model is formulated. The spectral topological consistency loss and spatial topological consistency loss are then established by imposing graph construction on spectral vectors and spatial features, which are added into the basic observation model to acquire the overall loss of TCNet. Thirdly, the gradient descent based optimization strategy is designed to obtain the solutions of the overall loss and determine the final fusion mapping network. Extensive experiments have been implemented to validate that the proposed TCNet method achieves more competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "The efficacy of the Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is fundamentally limited by the divergence between globally optimal strategies and agents’ local, often myopic, decisions during execution. This inconsistency frequently traps agents in local dilemmas, undermining team-level performance. We introduce QMIP, a new MARL method that directly confronts this challenge by explicitly aligning individual policies with a shared team goal. At the core of QMIP is the Macro Intention Prediction (MIP) module, which pioneers the use of a multi-head self-attention network to infer a dynamic, teamwide macro-intention. This intention acts as a powerful corrective signal, guiding agents to escape local optima and fostering robust, coherent collaboration. An average intent loss is designed to ensure stable and effective training of the MIP module. On challenging benchmarks including SMAC, GRF, and MPE, QMIP demonstrates superior performance, substantially outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in both convergence and final win rates. The pivotal role of the MIP module is confirmed through rigorous ablation studies. QMIP not only sets a new performance benchmark but also provides a novel architectural paradigm for developing highly coordinated intelligent agent systems."

To achieve ultra-low energy consumption, this paradigm transforms optimization problems into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and leverages the ability of analog computers to naturally solve ODEs (no need for time discretization) in physically real time. However, this transformation can fail if the optimization problem, such as the general convex nonlinear programs (NLPs) considered in this article, has no feasible solution. To avoid transformation failure and enable infeasibility detection, we introduce the homogeneous monotone complementarity problem formulation for convex NLPs. To achieve scalability and an execution time certificate, this article introduces the Newton-based fixed-time-stable scheme for the transformed ODE, whose settling time <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$T_{p}$</tex-math></inline-formula> can be prescribed by choosing the ODE's time coefficient as <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k=\\frac{\\pi }{2T_{p}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>.

    "abstract": "Microwave-based weed control offers a sustainable alternative to chemical herbicides. This study investigates the feasibility of applying microwave technology for selective weed management in prickly pear cactus plantations, with a focus on minimizing thermal damage to the crop while maximizing weed suppression. A chamber–waveguide device operating at 2.45 GHz was used under controlled conditions to evaluate plant physiological responses, heating dynamics, and optimal orientation for energy delivery. Comparative energy analyses were conducted between the proposed solar-powered autonomous microwave system and traditional tractor-based herbicide application. This analysis reveals that the traditional method requires substantially higher energy input than the proposed microwave-based approach, while relying exclusively on nonrenewable fossil resources. Indeed, the energy embodied in herbicide production, transportation, and tractor-based application contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. On the other hand, the proposed system is powered by solar energy, a renewable and locally accessible resource that avoids the environmental burdens associated with fossil fuels."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a rapid and non-destructive method for detecting multiple chemical residues in pure cotton fabrics, utilizing hyperspectral imaging, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to address limitations of traditional techniques, which have low efficiency and destructive nature. Initially, spectral data were collected from pure cotton fabric samples using a hyperspectral imaging system operating within the 400–1000 nm wavelength range , with each sample yielding one averaged spectrum from 100 pixels. The dataset was split 75:25 for training (9,000 spectra) and testing (3,000 spectra), using stratified sample-wise partitioning to prevent spectral leakage. Subsequently, DWT was applied for data dimensionality reduction, eliminating redundant information while retaining critical spectral characteristics. An optimized 1D-CNN model was developed to automatically extract spectral features and classify multiple residues, including formaldehyde, 4-aminobiphenyl, nonylphenol, melamine, and ethanol. The experimental findings demonstrated that the DWT preserved high information entropy (13.02) even after dimensionality reduction to 75 features. Furthermore, its computational efficiency significantly surpassed that of competitive adaptive reweighted sampling and kernel principal component analysis. In conjunction with DWT for dimensionality reduction, the 1D-CNN model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 99.76% and an F1 score of 0.99, exceeding the performance of the support vector machine and random forest models by 2.03% and 38.53%, respectively. This methodology facilitates non-destructive and rapid detection, achieving over 50% increase in detection speed while maintaining high accuracy in identifying formaldehyde residue. It represents an effective technological solution for ensuring textile quality and safety. Future work will focus on designing lightweight network architectures, implementing data augmentation strategies, and expanding the model’s applicability to detect multiple pollutants, aiming to enhance its practical deployment and generalization capability."

    "abstract": "This study presents a reinforcement learning-based interval type-2 (IT-2) fuzzy formation tracking control strategy for leader-follower flexible joint robots (FJRs), addressing challenges arising from nonlinearities, unmodeled dynamics, and unknown external disturbances. The proposed approach employs fractional-order sliding mode control (FOSMC) to guarantee finite-time convergence of the tracking error with rigorously proven stability. Unlike conventional backstepping methods, the IT-2 fuzzy FOSMC framework effectively addresses uncertainties and disturbances. By considering the memory effect of fractional calculus, a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the formation tracking dynamics is derived using an auxiliary system and equivalent transformation. A novel cost function based on the derivative of the formation tracking error is introduced, resulting in a discounted cost that accounts for the Laplacian matrix <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\widehat{L}$</tex-math></inline-formula> under a performance constraint. The optimal cost function and formation sliding mode control policy are shown to be gradually approximable via policy iteration. To achieve intelligent near-optimal control, a reinforcement learning algorithm based on an actor-critic neural network architecture is implemented, enabling all agents to compensate for system uncertainties and maintain formation tracking with the leader. Lyapunov stability analysis confirms that all follower FJRs can track the leader using actor-critic update laws for neural network weights, with distributed tracking error designs ensuring convergence to optimal values. Simulation results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating reduced chattering, improved formation tracking, and enhanced robustness."

In order to constantly select the scenario that optimizes the loss of energy, the suggested method makes use of conditionally inverted strategies, such as Lower bit inversion, Upper-Lower bit inversion, and Upper bit inverted. This technology improves system effectiveness by lowering the amount of transition on interconnection buses, which results in significant electrical benefits. Through careful hardware optimization, the encoder design reduces latency and helps preserve fixed power. Research comparing the suggested technique to more conventional approaches reveals that it uses fewer resources and causes less delay than XOR-XNOR, Even-Odd inverting, and the earlier Upper-Lower Inverted technique with a predicted overall performance of around 96%."

A mixed-methods approach was adopted by first conducting qualitative interviews of 42 Chinese tourists to Japan and then using structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze results of a quantitative survey among 300 Chinese tourists who had visited Japan. Extraversion is positively connected to social interaction as a motivation to travel and to physical operant resources, and these are also positively related to TTI. Extraversion was not related to cultural operant resources whereas cultural operant resources were negatively linked to TTI. Our results confirmed a positive impact of TTI on tourist satisfaction. Finally, Chinese culture may also explain a general reluctance to engage in TTI. The originality of this research lies in in its incorporation of Chinese cultural concepts to explain a general reluctance among Chinese tourists to engage in social interactions with strangers."

A solar still works by using solar radiation as its primary heat source for the distillation process. As a result, water vapor is separated from contaminants in the salty, contaminated water within the basin. However, one major limitation of solar stills is their low distillate output. In this study, the water depth in the solar still’s basin was varied to assess its effect on performance. It was found that water depth significantly influenced the still’s efficiency, with a depth of 5 cm yielding the highest distillate production."

Rule-based intrusion detection systems and traditional firewalls tend to be inflexible and context-insensitive, with little ability to protect transient, stateless functions. This work proposes a Serverless Intelligent Firewall framework that combines deep learning-based intrusion detection with Zero-Trust enforcement for delivering adaptive, real-time threat detection in cloud-native systems. Drawing on the CICIDS2017 dataset, the novel approach employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture temporal patterns in traffic behavior, thereby discovering thinly disguised anomalies and synchronized attacks that stateless models often miss. To address the inherent bias in class-imbalanced datasets, an undersampling approach was designed through preprocessing to mitigate model bias. The LSTM architecture achieved 98% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, outperforming baseline models, including Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The results validate the efficacy of our suggested architecture in enabling innovative, scalable, and Zero-Trust-compliant security within serverless settings."

This paper tried to solve a persistent issue in research domain of fundus image processing in recent years, challenges like class imbalance of DR category in benchmark datasets. This has been done with selective down-sampling and blending of fundus images from multiple datasets. Smaller lesions like micronaneurysms are difficult to learn by neural networks because of less prominent spatial information and similarity to other healthy tissues. The proposed model achieves an average accuracy of $89 \\%$ in multi-class DR classification.

Carbyne, a carbon allotrope, shows promise in sensing applications, but its stability under radiation, relevant in nuclear and medical settings, is not investigated yet. SAW devices coated with carbyne-enriched films were exposed to 100 kRad of irradiation, and their ethanol-sensing performance was evaluated before and after exposure by measuring impedance, phase angle, resistance, capacitance, and signal response. After irradiation, a slight increase in impedance (approximately 1%) was observed across the frequency range, and the phase angle shifted, with a maximal deviation of approximately 10°. The contact resistance negligibly increased, while the interface capacitance decreased by almost one order of magnitude for some frequencies. Most importantly, the voltage difference between the output and the input signal increased from a 17 mV before irradiation to 172 mV after exposure to 100 kRad, indicating improved sensitivity. Results indicate that irradiation doesn't negatively impact sensor performance; in fact, it enhances sensitivity to ethanol. The study provides insights into the stability of carbyne coatings under harsh conditions and the reliability of carbyne-based SAW sensors following irradiation."

A model of a PV array is introduced to study the impact of temperature and irradiance changes on power output. To boost the SPV system’s output to the desired DC link voltage, a DC-DC boost converter is employed. A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for tracking the Maximum Power Point (MPP) is employed, wherein fuzzy rules provide the optimal duty cycle in response to different environmental conditions. A three-phase DC-AC inverter is used for converting the DC voltage to AC, and the VSG controller improves the inverter output to derive maximum power. The performance of the proposed system is tested under various load fluctuation conditions by using MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results illustrate the robustness and efficiency of the developed control strategies to ensure stable operation and efficiency of the SPV system under dynamic loads."

    "abstract": "This research focuses on the innovative application of depth-generating models in image synthesis. A new algorithm named VGFNet (Variational Generative Flow Network) is proposed based on the fusion of three classical fundamental Models (variational autoencoder VAE, generative adversarial network GAN and Flow Models). Through in-depth analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each basic model, we design a comprehensive new model that not only inherits the advantages of these basic models, but also shows significant advantages in the quality, diversity and computational efficiency of the generated images. VGFNet uses a novel feature extraction mechanism, in which the encoder part utilizes multi-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract deep features from input images, capable of capturing multi-level feature representations from low-level edges to high-level semantic information. At the same time, the flow model component processes latent variables through a series of reversible transformation layers, allowing the model to achieve accurate probability density estimates while maintaining efficient computation. This combination method not only enhances the learning ability of the model, but also improves the realism and diversity of the generated images. In terms of time series processing, although VGFNet is primarily optimized for static image generation tasks, the dynamic nature of its architecture also makes it possible to process data with a time dimension. For example, in application scenarios involving video frame generation or continuous image sequences, VGFNet can ensure visual consistency and coherence of the generated time-series images by imposing smoothing constraints on the underlying variables between successive frames. To verify the effectiveness of the new model, we conducted a series of rigorous experimental evaluations and compared them with current mainstream image synthesis methods. Experimental results show that VGFNet outperforms traditional methods on Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), especially in high-resolution image synthesis and complex scene reconstruction tasks. The new model can provide more realistic and detailed image output. Therefore, the VGFNet proposed in this paper provides a new research idea and technical means for the field of image synthesis, and shows its great potential in practical application. Future research will further explore the potential of the model for processing time series data and its performance in a wider range of application scenarios."

    "abstract": "For future aircraft programs, ecological and economic sustainability will be one of the main design drivers. For the electronic systems on board such aircraft, this means on the one hand to minimize the footprint in terms of weight, power consumption, production and material efforts. On the other hand, following the general trends of digital transformation, the systems - and the aircraft in total - need to be much more intelligent and highly interconnected, enabling data-driven services on board and on ground for the whole aeronautic ecosystem, but potentially also beyond, e.g., to enable interaction with ground systems that are traditionally not part of the air transport system. This paper proposes an approach to meet these requirements by introducing a shared resources platform for power, processing, network and storage for aircraft electronics. With a focus on data management, the platform is composed of compute modules interconnected by Ethernetbased communication networks, namely IEEE TSN and Airbus AFDX. This approach enables an optimized implementation, with respect to design, production, operations and maintenance costs as well as environmental footprint, of functions across all design assurance levels. By introducing an updated version of the well-known ARINC 664 Part 5 security domain model, dataflows between trusted and untrusted entities and the increased attack surface due to the increased connectivity can be handled even more secure, while also aiming to comply with current security regulations such as CS25.1319 as well as Part-IS. In addition to low-level infrastructure features, the platform is complemented by a data-centric approach based on GAIA-X that allows decoupling hosted applications from each other while fostering a much better data exchange between them. This decoupling can also enable interaction between the aircraft and the ground to improve overall operation efficiency and to migrate function hosting from the aircraft to the ground. The viability of the platform is demonstrated by applying it to the refuelling process during the turnaround, integrating aircraft avionics, the electronic flight bag (EFB), the pilot, aircraft refueler and logging as well as accounting processes."

Integrating an Agent-based Dynamic Airport Transfer Model (ADATM) for ground operations and a Fluid Queue Sector Network Model (FQSNM) for airspace dynamics, the framework simulates delay propagation through agent interactions and fluid queuing theory. ADATM captures granular state transitions of flights and airports, while FQSNM transforms discrete aircraft flows into continuum dynamics for scalable sector-level analysis. Validated on 11,452 Chinese flights, the model achieved precise predictions: individual flight departure/arrival delays averaged 2.32/2.31 minutes from actual values, with 1.2 minutes average deviations for the top 10 busiest airports. It identified systemic bottlenecks, such as capacity-driven delays at major hubs, and aligned congestion rankings for 17 of 21 critical sectors. The approach overcomes computational limitations of traditional methods, balancing operational granularity and efficiency for strategic scheduling. Future work will enhance adaptability to dynamic capacity fluctuations using machine learning."

However, one major limitation of electric vehicles that needs to be addressed is their long charging time. Fast charging methods have been introduced to overcome this issue. Nonetheless, fast charging has drawbacks, such as the gradual generation of heat that can influence battery performance and potentially contribute to long-term degradation. It is essential to develop strategies for safe, fast charging with less degradation. In this study, a numerical investigation was conducted to determine the optimal charging protocol for fast charging of a lithium-ion battery pack module equipped with an air-cooled thermal management system. The module was subjected to fast charging at different charging rates ranging from 1C to 7C using constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging and pulse charging. Following the fast charging simulations using these protocols, the performance of these testing protocols is compared based on the time required to fully charge the battery pack module and the maximum temperature rise observed. The results indicated that the Pulse charging protocol performed better in terms of less temperature rise compared to the CC-CV charging protocols. On the other hand, CC-CV charging demonstrated good performance in terms of the time taken to fully charge the battery. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the role of charging protocols in managing battery thermal responses during fast charging and maintaining temperature within safe limits, which is an essential factor in addressing thermal, safety, and potential long-term degradation concerns."

    "abstract": "Adders are crucial parts of arithmetic and data processing in contemporary digital circuits. As technology advances to more sophisticated nodes like 14 nm FinFET, there is a greater need than ever for fast and energy-efficient adders. Due to its enhanced switching speed and decreased leakage current, FinFET technology offers an excellent platform for creating high-performance circuits because of its exceptional control over short-channel effects. Design and analysis of certain high-speed adder architectures, such as ripple carry adders, carry look-ahead adders, carry select adders, and carry increment adders, on 14 nm FinFET technology using the Tanner tool are presented in this paper. The adder speed is enhanced, power consumption is minimized, and reliability is ensured even at low supply voltages by taking advantage of the three-dimensional gate structure of FinFETs. Simulation outputs reflect gains of around $20-30 \\%$ in delay, $40-50 \\%$ in power consumption, and considerable enhancement of the power-delay product (PDP) of different adder designs with respect to traditional methods."

This study assesses the technical and economic viability of renewable energy (RE) based EV charging stations for Jaipur, India, using HOMER. Various configurations incorporating solar photovoltaic (SPV), wind turbines (WT), and battery energy storage systems (BSS) were analyzed. The SPV-only configuration emerged as the most cost-effective option, achieving a LCOE of ₹4.00/kWh, a NPC of ₹110M, and a payback period of 7.62 years. Hybrid configurations, such as SPV + WT, achieved lower LCOE (₹3.83/kWh) and greater emission reductions but required higher initial capital investment. The findings underscore the potential of RE based EV charging systems to support sustainable transportation infrastructure and contribute to India’s decarbonization objectives."

It aimed to reduce language barriers and promote collaboration in mathematics education. Twelve students (six per country) presented and discussed lessons on reasoning, discovery-based learning, and cognitive activation. The presentations contained the students' native languages, bilingual slides, and Zoom subtitles. Japanese students reported high satisfaction and improved comprehension, especially during the Question and Answer sessions. German students, however, struggled with subtitle inaccuracies and the complexity of the bilingual material, which hindered understanding. Despite these challenges, all students expressed interest in future exchanges. The study showed that international collaboration is possible without a shared language like English. Although current translation tools have limitations, they can support inclusive and culturally responsive learning when used effectively. Enhancing translation accuracy and simplifying materials could further improve intercultural understanding."

This paper proposes a framework for discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition(EMD) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) based approach for power swing and fault classification. The method begins by measuring the current signals at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) which are then processed by using the proposed signal processing techniques. In order to validate the same, the above cases are simulated in a IEEE 5 bus system using PSCAD software and signal processing analysis carried out using MATLAB platform. The extracted IMFs (Intrinsic Mode function) and detail coefficients are analyzed and it exhibit a promising method to differentiate various faults events from power swing."

Furthermore, a novel scalable pyramid atrous convolution module is designed to replace the SPPF module. This module utilizes dilated convolutions instead of pooling layers, effectively reducing the loss of detailed information and improving both operational flexibility and computational efficiency of feature extraction. Experimental results on the VisDrone2019 dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves mAP@0.5 of 46.4%, surpassing mainstream models while maintaining the detection speed of 76 FPS, thus fulfilling real-time requirements.

Overall, more than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 0 0 0}$</tex> ground control transmissions are evaluated from both sides of the Atlantic. Half of the transmissions, from the US side, are transformed into semantic concepts with the European ontology. These concepts contain the information, which the ontology claims as relevant. The concepts are transformed into sequences of words, which are then transformed back to semantic concepts by the US ontology, i.e., the US implementation of what information is relevant. Comparing the US concepts generated through this process against the original US concepts defines the European loss. The process is then executed the other way around on the second half of transmissions stemming from the European side, resulting in the US loss. The European command type loss is currently 2.6% absolute, whereas the US loss is 1.2%, i.e., the extraction rate of commands decreases by these losses over the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to loss comparison, the main contribution of this work is that the generalized approach enables comparison and evaluation of different ontologies and especially different implementations of the ontologies."

In this work, we present a multi-objective optimization approach that formulates trajectory planning as a conditional sampling problem, solved using a Conditional Diffusion Model (CDM). First, we derive an aircraft dynamics model and a fuel-consumption model from the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA), encoding hard constraints and cost objectives, respectively. Next, we employ the expert dataset, comprising state-action-reward tuples, as our training set to independently train both the diffusion model and the conditional function. Finally, we incorporate the conditional function into the diffusion denoising steps to steer trajectory samples toward low-cost, dynamically feasible paths while enforcing avoidance of unavailable airspace. Experiments conducted in both conventional fixed-route airspace and FRA demonstrate that our method significantly reduces overall flight cost, respects aircraft dynamic limits, and maintains compliance with airspace restrictions."

The SMC regulates the PEM electrolyser, which is responsible for hydrogen production, to ensure robust operation under varying solar irradiance and electrolyser voltage conditions. Additionally, a battery state-of-charge (SOC)-based gating mechanism is introduced to prevent both overcharging and deep discharging, thereby enhancing battery lifespan and system reliability.

However, the threat landscape is also changing rapidly in tandem with this transformation, with increasingly complex cyberattacks that can pass through current security mechanisms because of their unidentified features. Identifying such novel threats is essential for an effective response, but existing AI-based intrusion detection systems methods often lack reliability when facing these unseen threats. Although transformer-based models have shown promise in threat detection and massive data volume management, they are prone to overconfident predictions on unfamiliar inputs, limiting their robustness. To address this, we propose a BERT-based intrusion detection approach trained with logit normalization, which enhances the model reliability by mitigating overconfidence in the model prediction, leading to better seen-unseen separation boundary. We evaluate our method on four benchmark datasets namely CICIDS2017, CICIoT2023, Edge-IIoTset and NSL-KDD, under intra- and cross-dataset conditions. Results show a substantial improvement in detecting unseen attacks, with accuracy rising from 3.9 % to almost 100 % while maintaining at least 95 % detection for seen threats. This work results in a robust and unified model capable of detecting seen attacks and identifying unseen ones."

A multi-factor wildfire model was developed using FDS/PyroSim software, incorporating diverse geospatial and meteorological data, including satellite imagery, digital elevation maps, landuse classifications, and profiles of wind speed and direction. The methodology provides a means of modeling and simulating fireinduced wind fields on a large scale for a specific location and time, providing wind field simulation data for flight simulation device (FSD). The simulated fire-induced wind turbulence was dynamically integrated into a Level-D FSD, a real-time simulation platform, to assess the aerodynamic response of a typical fixedwing FFA during aerial rescue operations. The results indicate that additional pilot control inputs are necessary to maintain pitch stabilization in turbulent conditions.

    "abstract": "This work presents a PSACO algorithm optimized approach of chip placement where the impartial is to diminish area and wirelength. A sub-step of physical design, placement assigns cells to fixed locations in a netlist while fulfilling timing and connectivity constraints. PSO is adaptive in global search while ACO is efficient in local search; the use of both addresses’ layout design as a multi-objective problem. In comparison with MCNC and GSRC circuits, the proposed method achieves area utilization improvement of 5.41% and wirelength improvement of 32.73% over standalone PSO for MCNC benchmarks. Smaller areas were squeezed more tightly within the chip leading to a slight degradation in area utilization by 2.94%, but significantly improving the wirelength by 2.06% as compared with their corresponding GSRC benchmarks. These results confirm the competitiveness of PSACO in solving NP-hard problems in VLSI design, providing a more harmonious trade-off between conflicting objectives."

    "abstract": "Signal integrity (SI) analysis becomes necessary as data rates, frequencies, density, and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) complexity grow. Double Data Rate (DDR) 4th generation memory is widely used in avionics systems, and each generation brings new design challenges. Recent developments in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools from the Ansys, Siemens, and Keysight suites enable the simulation and optimization of DDR signals to ensure compliance with Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) standards. Many vendors have developed DDR wizards that automate signal integrity analysis to reduce simulation setup time. On the other hand, simulation tools have their limitations, and the reliability of their results has yet to be validated on a real avionic board design. Research in this study aims to compare the DDR wizards from various simulation tools available on the market and correlate the results with measurements. This will help build confidence in the selected tools, developing a simulation methodology that allows design times to be reduced by relying solely on simulations, without the need for further measurements or test vehicles for future avionic designs."
