The QGSW equations generalize the Euler equations by including an additional parameter, the Rossby radius $\\varepsilon^{-1}$, which modifies the relationship between the streamfunction and the (potential) vorticity. In addition, we prove that solutions of the QGSW equations converge locally in time to the corresponding Euler solutions as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ in little Hölder spaces."

    "abstract": "The Rust programming language presents a steep learning curve and significant coding challenges, making the automation of issue resolution essential for its broader adoption. Recently, LLM-powered code agents have shown remarkable success in resolving complex software engineering tasks, yet their application to Rust has been limited by the absence of a large-scale, repository-level benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce Rust-SWE-bench, a benchmark comprising 500 real-world, repository-level software engineering tasks from 34 diverse and popular Rust repositories. We then perform a comprehensive study on Rust-SWE-bench with four representative agents and four state-of-the-art LLMs to establish a foundational understanding of their capabilities and limitations in the Rust ecosystem. Our extensive study reveals that while ReAct-style agents are promising, i.e., resolving up to 21.2% of issues, they are limited by two primary challenges: comprehending repository-wide code structure and complying with Rust's strict type and trait semantics. We also find that issue reproduction is rather critical for task resolution. Inspired by these findings, we propose RUSTFORGER, a novel agentic approach that integrates an automated test environment setup with a Rust metaprogramming-driven dynamic tracing strategy to facilitate reliable issue reproduction and dynamic analysis. The evaluation shows that RUSTFORGER using Claude-Sonnet-3.7 significantly outperforms all baselines, resolving 28.6% of tasks on Rust-SWE-bench, i.e., a 34.9% improvement over the strongest baseline, and, in aggregate, uniquely solves 46 tasks that no other agent could solve across all adopted advanced LLMs."

Utilizing the multichannel Resonating Group Method (RGM), my model explicitly includes 12C+12C and alpha+20Ne reaction channels (with excited states). This approach provides a consistent, simultaneous, description of fusion, elastic scattering, and 24Mg spectroscopy. Results for 12C+12C elastic scattering show excellent agreement with experimental data, significantly improving the single-channel approximations. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that 24Mg states and resonances are highly mixed configurations, contradicting the concept of pure \"molecular states.\" The calculated fusion S-factor is consistent with available experimental data and predicts both narrow and broad resonances near the Coulomb barrier. Main resonance widths originate primarily from the alpha+20Ne exit channels. The S-factor exhibits a decrease at low energies, providing a microscopic support for the hypothesis of fusion hindrance. This work is a first step towards a reliable theoretical extrapolation of the 12C+12C reaction to deep stellar burning temperatures. Future works should include the neutron and proton channels to provide a complete description of the 12C+12C fusion."

This study introduces Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP), a task in which a model predicts how a user would comment on a given stimulus by comparing generated outputs with authentic digital traces. This framework enables a rigorous evaluation of current LLM capabilities with respect to the simulation of social media user behavior. We evaluated open-weight 8B models (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish language scenarios. By systematically comparing prompting strategies (explicit vs. implicit) and the impact of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we identify a critical form vs. content decoupling in low-resource settings: while SFT aligns the surface structure of the text output (length and syntax), it degrades semantic grounding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicit conditioning (generated biographies) becomes redundant under fine-tuning, as models successfully perform latent inference directly from behavioral histories. Our findings challenge current \"naive prompting\" paradigms and offer operational guidelines prioritizing authentic behavioral traces over descriptive personas for high-fidelity simulation."

Moreover, we define and study a relative index map on relative uniform K-homology that combines uniform coarse information on the interior with secondary information on the boundary. As an application, we compute that on a spin manifold with product structure and uniformly positive scalar curvature on the boundary the image of the relative uniform K-homology class of the Dirac operator under this relative index map is closely connected to a uniform version of the higher $ρ$-invariant of the boundary. In particular, a delocalized APS-index theorem of Piazza and Schick is proved in the uniform setting."

Existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy: they often require expensive reference models and multiple forward passes, or apply static edits that risk suppressing genuine visual evidence. To address this, we introduce HulluEdit, a single-pass, reference-free intervention framework. Our core innovation is orthogonal subspace editing: we decompose the hidden states of the model into orthogonal subspaces - visual evidence, conflicting priors, and residual uncertainty - enabling selective suppression of hallucinatory patterns without interfering with visual grounding. This approach mathematically guarantees that edits applied to the prior subspace leave the visual component entirely unaffected. Extensive experiments show that HulluEdit achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction on benchmarks including POPE and CHAIR across diverse architectures, while preserving general capabilities on MME and maintaining efficient inference. Our method consistently outperforms contrastive decoding and static subspace editing baselines, offering a new pathway toward more trustworthy LVLMs."

Large Language Models (LLMs) enable promising solutions to this problem, with operator-centric solutions that generate table manipulation pipelines in a multi-step manner offering state-of-the-art performance.

We propose Operation-R1, the first framework that trains lightweight LLMs (e.g., Qwen-4B/1.7B) via a novel variant of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to produce high-quality data-preparation pipelines for TQA in a single inference step. To train such an LLM, we first introduce a self-supervised rewarding mechanism to automatically obtain fine-grained pipeline-wise supervision signals for LLM training. We also propose variance-aware group resampling to mitigate training instability. To further enhance robustness of pipeline generation, we develop two complementary mechanisms: operation merge, which filters spurious operations through multi-candidate consensus, and adaptive rollback, which offers runtime protection against information loss in data transformation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that, with the same LLM backbone, Operation-R1 achieves average absolute accuracy gains of 9.55 and 6.08 percentage points over multi-step preparation baselines, with 79\\% table compression and a 2.2$\\times$ reduction in monetary cost."

We then introduce a test-time steering intervention that simply multiplies the activations of the identified bottlenecks by a scalar. Across 5 SSMs and 6 diverse benchmarks, this intervention improves performance by an average of 8.27%, without requiring any task-specific tuning. Finally, we validate that the identified bottlenecks are indeed hindering performance by modifying them to yield an architecture we call Stable-Mamba, which achieves long-context performance gains when retrained from scratch."

Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage. To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline."

The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale frequency mixing strategy to fuse feature information across different frequency domains. Experimental results on multiple 3D scene benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, while real-world deployment experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization capability."

We then introduce a minimal ``twisted'' gluing mechanism controlled by a $\\mathbb Z/2$-valued Čech $2$-cocycle and an involutive automorphism of the coefficient algebra. Under a Kirchberg--UCT hypothesis on the quantum-group crossed-product coefficient, the twist produces a nontrivial differential $d_2$ identified as $\\varphi_*-\\mathrm{id}$ on coefficient $K$-theory. In a concrete regime where the coefficient $K$-groups are cyclic (e.g.\\ order $3$), the differential becomes an isomorphism and forces a $K$-theoretic obstruction to Morita triviality.

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled way to audit such memorization by determining whether a given sample was included in training. However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image. This embedding amplifies conditional loss responses for member samples while leaving hold-outs relatively less affected, thereby enhancing separability in the absence of ground-truth captions. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that MoFit consistently outperforms prior VLM-conditioned baselines and achieves performance competitive with caption-dependent methods."

    "abstract": "Finding intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and measuring their masses and spins are key to understanding massive black hole formation. White dwarf (WD)-IMBH binaries provide a unique probe because they emit both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves (GWs), thereby conveying richer information. However, such multi-messenger sources often enter the regime of strong gravity, where existing models fail to capture their relativistic dynamics. Here, we develop a fully relativistic model for the tidal response of a WD close to an IMBH and use it to study the secular orbital evolution as well as the GW signal. We find that for IMBHs more massive than 10^5 solar masses, tidal interaction becomes relativistic and sensitive to IMBH spin. The interaction generally dissipates binary orbital energy and angular momentum, but due to relativistic frame rotation, which reduces phase coherence across pericenter passages, the orbit-averaged tidal dissipation rate can be suppressed by up to about 50% relative to Newtonian predictions. Including tidal dissipation leads to more rapid damping of the orbital eccentricity, to the extent that the pericenter distance may even increase over time, potentially explaining quasi-periodic eruptions and secular orbital period growth. Such tidal effects accumulate into measurable phase and amplitude deviations in the GW signal. For typical space-based observations, the GW waveform mismatch can reach values of order 0.1 within 6 months. Our results indicate that relativistic tidal dissipation is both dynamically important and observationally essential for reliably predicting the multi-messenger signals of WD-IMBH systems."

Applying a second-degree polynomial to fit red giant branch (RGB), we identify the TRGB as the star closest to the fitted curve's endpoint. By this method, we expanded TRGB samples in global clusters to 91 with newer observational data. Our results show a decreasing trend in I-band luminosity for metallicities greater than $-$1, consistent with previous studies.

While recent work has explored open-vocabulary occupancy in outdoor driving scenarios, such methods transfer poorly indoors, where geometry is denser, layouts are more intricate, and semantics are far more fine-grained. To address these challenges, we adopt a geometry-only supervision paradigm that uses only binary occupancy labels (occupied vs free). Our framework builds upon 3D Language-Embedded Gaussians, which serve as a unified intermediate representation coupling fine-grained 3D geometry with a language-aligned semantic embedding. On the geometry side, we find that existing Gaussian-to-Occupancy operators fail to converge under such weak supervision, and we introduce an opacity-aware, Poisson-based approach that stabilizes volumetric aggregation. On the semantic side, direct alignment between rendered features and open-vocabulary segmentation features suffers from feature mixing; we therefore propose a Progressive Temperature Decay schedule that gradually sharpens opacities during splatting, strengthening Gaussian-language alignment. On Occ-ScanNet, our framework achieves 59.50 IoU and 21.05 mIoU in the open-vocabulary setting, surpassing all existing occupancy methods in IoU and outperforming prior open-vocabulary approaches by a large margin in mIoU.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a generalist robotic agent. However, existing VLAs are hindered by excessive parameter scales, prohibitive pre-training requirements, and limited applicability to diverse embodiments. To improve the practicality of VLAs, we propose a comprehensive benchmark and an improved baseline. First, we propose CEBench, a new benchmark spanning diverse embodiments in both simulation and the real world with consideration of domain randomization. We collect 14.4k simulated trajectories and 1.6k real-world expert-curated trajectories to support training on CEBench. Second, using CEBench as our testbed, we study three critical aspects of VLAs' practicality and offer several key findings. Informed by these findings, we introduce LLaVA-VLA, a lightweight yet powerful VLA designed for practical deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. Architecturally, it integrates a compact VLM backbone with multi-view perception, proprioceptive tokenization, and action chunking. To eliminate reliance on costly pre-training, LLaVA-VLA adopts a two-stage training paradigm including post-training and fine-tuning. Furthermore, LLaVA-VLA extends the action space to unify navigation and manipulation. Experiments across embodiments demonstrate the capabilities of generalization and versatility of LLaVA-VLA , while real-world mobile manipulation experiments establish it as the first end-to-end VLA model for mobile manipulation. We will open-source all datasets, codes, and checkpoints upon acceptance to foster reproducibility and future research."

These shortcomings provide limited support for model development and multimodal perception research. We propose a practical approach for AVQA dataset construction. First, we design a crowdsourced subjective experiment framework for AVQA, breaks the constraints of in-lab settings and achieves reliable annotation across varied environments. Second, a systematic data preparation strategy is further employed to ensure broad coverage of both quality levels and semantic scenarios. Third, we extend the dataset with additional annotations, enabling research on multimodal perception mechanisms and their relation to content. Finally, we validate this approach through YT-NTU-AVQ, the largest and most diverse AVQA dataset to date, consisting of 1,620 user-generated audio and video (A/V) sequences.

While a dedicated synthetic word detector could be developed, we investigate a cost-effective method that fine-tunes a pre-trained Whisper model to detect synthetic words while transcribing the input utterance via next-token prediction. We further investigate using partially vocoded utterances as the fine-tuning data, thereby reducing the cost of data collection. Our experiments demonstrate that, on in-domain test data, the fine-tuned Whisper yields low synthetic-word detection error rates and transcription error rates. On out-of-domain test data with synthetic words produced by unseen speech generative models, the fine-tuned Whisper remains on par with a dedicated ResNet-based detection model; however, the overall performance degradation calls for strategies to improve its generalization capability."

    "abstract": "We introduce an Ising spin-glass model with correlated disorder which continuously interpolates between the pure ferromagnetic Ising model and the Edwards-Anderson model with symmetric disorder. For this model, we prove that physical quantities on the Nishimori line (NL) can be expressed exactly in terms of those of the pure Ising model at an effective temperature on any lattice in any dimension. For example, the energy on the NL is equal to the energy of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature up to a constant and a trivial factor. More remarkably, the specific heat on the NL equals the energy, not the specific heat, of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature, again up to a constant and a trivial factor. Gauge-noninvariant quantities such as the magnetization and correlation functions are exactly equal to the corresponding quantities of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature. These exact relations imply that the leading critical behavior at that multicritical point for the disorder-correlated model is pure-Ising-like, in contrast to the conventional multicritical universality class of the standard Edwards-Anderson model. Our results motivate further investigations of the relatively unexplored topic of correlations in disorder in spin glasses and related problems."

Beyond the conventional zero-dimensional power balance analysis presuming the global energy and particle confinement times, gyrokinetic-simulation-based evaluation of a steady burning condition with He-ash exhaust and D-T fuel inward pinch is demonstrated. It is clarified that a significant imbalance appears in the turbulent particle flux for the fuel ions of D and T, depending on the D-T density ratio and the He-ash accumulation. Then several profile regimes to satisfy Reiter's steady burning condition are, for the first time, identified by the gyrokinetic simulation. Also, the impacts of zonal flows and nonthermal He-ash on the optimal profile regimes are examined."

Then, by exploiting the structural properties of the shock, we show the $L^2$ contraction property of the shock profile under arbitrarily large perturbations, up to a time-dependent shift. This result implies both time-asymptotic stability and uniform stability with respect to the viscosity and dispersion coefficients. This uniformity yields zero viscosity-dispersion limits."

    "abstract": "Universal graph pre-training has emerged as a key paradigm in graph representation learning, offering a promising way to train encoders to learn transferable representations from unlabeled graphs and to effectively generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation.This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.Furthermore, for challenge (ii), MUG trains a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views rather than relying on dataset-specific aggregation strategies, while a global objective encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MUG on some real datasets."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we mainly revisit a nice theory for topological entropy of weakly equivalent flows, which was originally investigated by Ohno in 1980. We will develop a new approach, being more straightforward and elementary than the measure-theoretic one provided by Ohno, to the theory for weak equivalence of flows, and as a novelty, we study both topological entropy and mean dimension with a highly unified process in relation to such objects. In particular, for weakly equivalent flows without fixed points we recover Ohno's theorem for topological entropy relation with a substantially different method, and moreover, carry out an analogue within the framework of mean dimension; while for weakly equivalent flows with fixed points, our technique refines the procedure suggested in Ohno's construction, and strengthens Ohno's example with a view towards topological complexity of dynamical systems. Essentially, our method is topological. For this purpose, we first introduce a modification to the definition of topological entropy, by relating a spanning set inside the state space to a finite set outside, which comes to be a tiny but key difference, via a map, and further, show that it leads eventually to the same value as the topological entropy. Although to an intermediate extent, the modified quantity generally does not coincide with the one appearing in the classical definition, it has some basic combinatorial feature, which not only applies flexibly to topological entropy, but also adapts directly to the mean dimension context. Using this alternative, we are allowed to re-establish and enrich Ohno's theory."

We form the block quadrifocal tensor and show that it admits a Tucker decomposition whose factor matrices are the stacked camera matrices, and which thus has a multilinear rank of (4,~4,~4,~4) independent of $n$. We develop the first synchronization algorithm for quadrifocal tensors, using Tucker decomposition, alternating direction method of multipliers, and iteratively reweighted least squares. We further establish relationships between the block quadrifocal, trifocal, and bifocal tensors, and introduce an algorithm that jointly synchronizes these three entities. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on modern datasets, indicating the potential and importance of using higher-order information in synchronization."

In the case of the detuning tuned to the first blue sideband, the response spectrum shows a conversion from the absorption peak to the transparency window. Furthermore, we investigate the fluctuation spectra of the collective excitation modes of ion ensemble and show the similar phenomena."

Our results apply to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model at any constant temperature -- including when the thermal state is highly entangled and satisfies polynomial quantum circuit lower bounds, a sign problem, and nontrivial instance-to-instance fluctuations.

They are nonlinear, localized plasma waves that maintain their shape and velocity over time and distance. While their occurrence in various space plasma environments has been extensively reported, their observation during geomagnetic storms, large-scale disturbances driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, remains limited. In this study, we present a comparative investigation of magnetosonic soliton signatures during geomagnetic storms associated with Solar Cycles 24 and 25. Using high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Cluster II mission, we systematically examine the plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation and their evolution during storm-time dynamics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework, incorporating several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, is developed to reliably detect and characterize magnetosonic solitons. The results demonstrate that solitary structures in both storms predominantly occur during the early storm intervals, prior to the main phase, suggesting that they may serve as potential precursor signatures of enhanced geomagnetic activity."

    "abstract": "In Embedding-as-an-Interface (EaaI) settings, pre-trained models are queried for Intermediate Representations (IRs). The distributional properties of IRs can leak training-set membership signals, enabling Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) whose strength varies across layers. Although Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) mitigates such leakage, existing implementations employ per-example gradient clipping and a uniform, layer-agnostic noise multiplier, ignoring heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability. This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD. Extensive experiments show that, under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces the peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility, yielding a superior privacy-utility trade-off."

    "abstract": "Condition injection enables diffusion models to generate context-aware outputs, which is essential for many time-series tasks. However, heterogeneous conditional contexts (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns or outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. We observe consistent gains on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Moreover, gradient diagnostics attribute these improvements to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training. Overall, these results show that sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance."

    "abstract": "A thermodynamic framework for asymptotic inference is developed in which sample size and parameter variance define a state space. Within this description, Shannon information plays the role of entropy, and an integrating factor organizes its variation into a first-law-type balance equation. The framework supports a cyclic inequality analogous to a reversed second law, derived for the estimation of the mean. A non-trivial third-law-type result emerges as a lower bound on entropy set by representation noise. Optimal inference paths, global bounds on information gain, and a natural Carnot-like information efficiency follow from this structure, with efficiency fundamentally limited by a noise floor. Finally, de Bruijn's identity and the I-MMSE relation in the Gaussian-limit case appear as coordinate projections of the same underlying thermodynamic structure. This framework suggests that ensemble physics and inferential physics constitute shadow processes evolving in opposite directions within a unified thermodynamic description."

We prove the existence of a pathwise mean-field equilibrium in this context by developing new technical tools for compactification to accommodate rough integration, which deviate substantially from classical compactification arguments in the literature. Finally, we discuss the relationship between the pathwise problem and the classical MFG problem with randomized Brownian common noise: conditioning yields the pathwise problem almost surely; and conversely, under a suitable causality/measurable-selection requirement, pathwise mean-field equilibria can be aggregated to produce randomized mean-field equilibria in the classical problem."

We demonstrate that linear decoders trained on one condition generally transfer successfully to others, implying shared speech representations. This commonality was assessed with stimulus-level discriminability by performing a rank-based analysis demonstrating preservation of stimulus-specific structure in both within- and across-conditions.

Conventional methods have developed similar diffusion-based solutions to address these challenges of novel view synthesis. Despite significant improvements, these methods typically rely on off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion priors and fine-tune only the UNet module while keeping other components frozen, which still leads to inconsistent details and artifacts even when incorporating geometry-aware regularizations like depth or semantic conditions. To address this, we investigate the latent space of the diffusion model and introduce two components: (1) temporal equivariance regularization and (2) vision foundation model-aligned representation, both applied to the variational autoencoder (VAE) module within the SVD pipeline. BetterScene integrates a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model to render features as inputs for the SVD enhancer and generate continuous, artifact-free, consistent novel views.

We present Flying Serving, a vLLM-based system that enables online DP-TP switching without restarting engine workers. Flying Serving makes reconfiguration practical by virtualizing the state that would otherwise force data movement: (i) a zero-copy Model Weights Manager that exposes TP shard views on demand, (ii) a KV Cache Adaptor that preserves request KV state across DP/TP layouts, (iii) an eagerly initialized Communicator Pool to amortize collective setup, and (iv) a deadlock-free scheduler that coordinates safe transitions under execution skew.

Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings.

Several systems have been designed to improve shuffle efficiency, but from our experiences of running ultra-large clusters at Alibaba Cloud MaxCompute platform, we observe that they can not adapt to highly dynamic job characteristics and cluster resource conditions, and their fault tolerance mechanisms are passive and inefficient when failures are inevitable. To tackle their limitations, we design and implement FuxiShuffle as a general data shuffle service for the ultra-large production environment of MaxCompute, featuring good adaptability and efficient failure resilience. Specifically, to achieve good adaptability, FuxiShuffle dynamically selects the shuffle mode based on runtime information, conducts progress-aware scheduling for the downstream workers, and automatically determines the most suitable backup strategy for each shuffle data chunk. To make failure resilience efficient, FuxiShuffle actively ensures data availability with multi-replica failover, prevents memory overflow with careful memory management, and employs an incremental recovery mechanism that does not lose computation progress. Our experiments show that, compared to baseline systems, FuxiShuffle significantly reduces not only end-to-end job completion time but also aggregate resource consumption. Micro experiments suggest that our designs are effective in improving adaptability and failure resilience."

Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget. As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\\times$ attention and 3.81$\\times$ end-to-end speedups."

For bilevel programs it is known that the first order approach requires the convexity of the lower level program while reformulations involving the value function results in difficult optimization problems. In this paper we propose a directional first order approach which does not require the convexity of the lower level program. First, under some reasonable assumptions, we show that the lower level program can be equivalently characterized by its first order condition over a directional neighborhood. Next, for the resulting single level optimization problem, under common constraint qualifications, we establish directional necessary optimality conditions. Finally, an example of BP with nonconvex lower level program is given, where we demonstrate the failure of the classical first order approach and derive necessary optimality conditions using its directional counterpart."

We recruited 1201 climate-concerned individuals to examine whether discussing climate actions with a large language model (LLM) equipped with climate knowledge and prompted to provide personalised responses would foster more accurate perceptions of the impacts of climate actions and increase willingness to adopt feasible, high-impact behaviours. We compared this to having participants run a web search, have a conversation with an unspecialised LLM, and no intervention. The personalised climate LLM was the only condition that led to increased knowledge about the impacts of climate actions and greater intentions to adopt impactful behaviours. While the personalised climate LLM did not outperform a web search in improving understanding of climate action impacts, the ability of LLMs to deliver personalised, actionable guidance may make them more effective at motivating impactful pro-climate behaviour change."

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that machine unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) fails to generalize across languages: knowledge erased in one language frequently remains accessible through others. However, the underlying cause of this failure and a principled solution remain open. In this work, we identify intervention depth as the key factor determining multilingual generalization. Through systematic layer-wise experiments, we characterize two distinct failure modes: shallow-layer interventions achieve erasure but collapse multilingual capabilities in held-out languages, while deep-layer interventions preserve utility but fail to erase target knowledge even in source languages. These findings reveal that the choice of intervention layer is not a free parameter; it fundamentally determines whether multilingual unlearning succeeds. We propose MUTE (Multilingual Unlearning via Targeted Erasure), a framework that uses Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Linguistic Regions Development Score (LRDS) to identify intermediate, language-agnostic layers where cross-lingual representations converge. By restricting unlearning updates to these layers, MUTE achieves robust multilingual knowledge erasure while optimizing on only a small set of source languages. Extensive experiments across three LLM architectures and three unlearning algorithms validate our approach, with mechanistic analysis via Logit Lens probing confirming genuine knowledge removal rather than output-level suppression."

    "abstract": "The deployment of machine learning in high-stakes domains requires a balance between predictive safety and algorithmic fairness. However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments."

By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks.

    "abstract": "Learning the dynamic causal structure of time series is a challenging problem. Most existing approaches rely on distributional or structural invariance to uncover underlying causal dynamics, assuming stationary or partially stationary causality. However, these assumptions often conflict with the complex, time-varying causal relationships observed in real-world systems. This motivates the need for methods that address fully dynamic causality, where both instantaneous and lagged dependencies evolve over time. Such a setting poses significant challenges for the efficiency and stability of causal discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce DyCausal, a dynamic causal structure learning framework. DyCausal leverages convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, and then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step, thereby recovering fine-grained and time-varying causal graphs. In addition, we propose an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling, which improves efficiency while effectively constraining loops in evolving causal structures. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DyCausal achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, offering a stable and efficient approach for identifying fully dynamic causal structures from coarse to fine."

Here, we demonstrate an interpretable self-driving laboratory framework that transforms autonomous optimization into human-usable growth rules. As a stringent benchmark, we apply this framework to RF magnetron sputtering, addressing a long-standing challenge of achieving high-quality beta-Ga2O3 heteroepitaxy and single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 homoepitaxy via sputtering. By combining Bayesian optimization with automated optical evaluation of the Urbach energy as a metric of sub-bandgap disorder, the self-driving system efficiently identifies heteroepitaxial growth conditions yielding a minimum Urbach energy of 182 meV, the lowest value for sputtered beta-Ga2O3 films. Importantly, the optimized growth window is transferable, realizing single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 homoepitaxy without further optimization, corroborated by scanning transmission electron microscopy. To convert the closed-loop dataset into interpretable growth rules, we train a random forest surrogate and distill it into response curves and quantified pairwise interactions across the four-dimensional growth-parameter space. This analysis identifies substrate temperature as the primary control knob, with RF power and gas flows acting largely additively and only a modest temperature-oxygen coupling delineating the narrow window for high-quality growth, establishing a general route from autonomous experimentation to transferable growth rules."

We present an empirical security analysis of three architectures (cloud-hosted, edge-local swarm, and hybrid) using a multi-device home-automation testbed with local MQTT messaging and an Android smartphone as an edge inference node. We identify five systems-level attack surfaces, including two emergent failures observed during live testbed operation: coordination-state divergence and induced trust erosion. We frame core security properties as measurable systems metrics: data egress volume, failover window exposure, sovereignty boundary integrity, and provenance chain completeness. Our measurements show that edge-local deployments eliminate routine cloud data exposure but silently degrade sovereignty when fallback mechanisms trigger, with boundary crossings invisible at the application layer. Provenance chains remain complete under cooperative operation yet are trivially bypassed without cryptographic enforcement. Failover windows create transient blind spots exploitable for unauthorised actuation. These results demonstrate that deployment architecture, not just model or prompt design, is a primary determinant of security risk in agent-controlled IoT systems."

This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents."

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as transportation, energy, and meteorology. Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios. By embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process, TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems."

The proof is based on a combinatorial analysis of Feynman diagrams, and on a detailed study of the BPHZ renormalisation of the model. We characterise the limiting distribution in terms of primitive blow-ups, and prove that no Laplacian renormalisation is present. Our approach seems applicable to a broad class of equations."

Using this framework, we establish a precise M-theory/Type IIB dictionary in the constant-coupling sector, showing how the physical axio-dilaton is fixed by eleven-dimensional geometric and topological data. The correspondence is tested at the level of the ten-dimensional bosonic effective action, including its topological couplings inherited from eleven dimensions. The tower-completed geometry naturally organizes global sectors in generalized cohomology, with charge data governed by K-theory and exhibiting a canonical prime-power torsion structure. We further show how this framework extends to varying-coupling backgrounds and duality defects, admits a natural adelic completion with prime-independence, and generalizes to higher-rank and U-duality geometries. We also discuss holographic aspects and the anomaly-refined extension of the duality group beyond the bosonic truncation. Together, these results provide a coherent, non-singular foundation for F-theory and its extensions."

Linear optical constants are extracted using spectroscopic ellipsometry and applied in fitting the harmonic generation behavior. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements exhibit pronounced anisotropy, with emission patterns well-described by theoretical models derived from the khi(2) and khi(3) tensor elements. The material demonstrates exceptionally high nonlinear susceptibilities, with khi(2) ~ 10^(-8) m/V and khi(3) ~ 10^(-17) m^2/V^2 which is a few orders of magnitude greater than comparable 2D materials reported in the literature. Temperature-dependent SHG and THG measurements from 300 K to 25 K reveal exponential decay in harmonic signal intensities, attributed to reduced carrier mobility, with no evidence of structural phase transitions, consistent with results from single crystal diffraction and heat capacity measurements. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements also reveal distinct orientation and ellipticity trends, highlighting the anisotropic nonlinear tensor contributions and contrasting polarization selection rules in the material.

Spectral methods address this challenge by exploiting the Fourier representation, treating the spectral density as a probability distribution for Monte Carlo approximation. Although this probabilistic interpretation works for stationary processes, it is overly restrictive for the nonstationary case, where spectral densities are generally not probability measures. We propose regular Fourier features for harmonizable processes that avoid this limitation. Our method discretizes the spectral representation directly, preserving the correlation structure among spectral weights without requiring probability assumptions. Under a finite spectral support assumption, this yields an efficient low-rank approximation that is positive semi-definite by construction. When the spectral density is unknown, the framework extends naturally to kernel learning from data. We demonstrate the method on locally stationary kernels and on harmonizable mixture kernels with complex-valued spectral densities."

    "abstract": "Applying LLM-based multi-agent software systems in safety-critical domains such as lifespan echocardiography introduces system-level risks that cannot be addressed by improving model accuracy alone. During system operation, beyond individual LLM behavior, uncertainty propagates through agent coordination, data pipelines, human-in-the-loop interaction, and runtime control logic. Yet existing work largely treats uncertainty at the model level rather than as a first-class software engineering concern. This paper approaches uncertainty from both system-level and runtime perspectives. We first differentiate epistemological and ontological uncertainties in the context of LLM-based multi-agent software system operation. Building on this foundation, we propose a lifecycle-based uncertainty management framework comprising four mechanisms: representation, identification, evolution, and adaptation. The uncertainty lifecycle governs how uncertainties emerge, transform, and are mitigated across architectural layers and execution phases, enabling structured runtime governance and controlled adaptation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the framework using a real-world LLM-based multi-agent echocardiographic software system developed in clinical collaboration, showing improved reliability and diagnosability in diagnostic reasoning. The proposed approach generalizes to other safety-critical LLM-based multi-agent software systems, supporting principled operational control and runtime assurance beyond model-centric methods."

The procedure is based on a Lagrangian embedding of the particle configuration space into a product of coadjoint orbits of the background isometry group. Examples are provided by particles on the plane, torus, sphere, and hyperbolic plane, with or without a monopole field. We elaborate the method by recovering the Hamiltonian spectrum and the wave functions on such spaces.

Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods."

    "abstract": "Adequate characterization of two-dimensional materials with low energy barriers for impurity adsorption is key for advancing applications based on catalysis, sensing, and surface functionalization. However, first-principles methods, such as DFT, are often computationally extremely expensive for feasible large-scale screenings. Given such a scenario, we address a data-driven approach which integrates the semi-empirical Extended Huckel Method with machine learning techniques to estimate adsorption energy barriers in the case of three relevant chalcogen impurities, S, Se and Te. With this aim, we consider the 4036 2D materials found in the C2DB. The scheme employs the EHM to compute energy profiles along three in-plane migration paths, from which average barriers can be derived. The equilibrium distance between the impurity and the 2D surface is not calculated from a tie-consuming geometry optimization. Instead, it is estimated from a simple effective phenomenological expression. Physicochemical descriptors are then obtained from the Matminer library for curated features. Four different ML models are tested, with the XGBoost leading to the highest performance. We further use SHAP to verify the resulting predictions, focusing on the $\\sim1,500$ materials displaying the lowest barrier values. As it could be anticipated, we establish that the average valence electron count, electronegativity, and atomic number are typically the most relevant attributes to validate the ML model. But we also are able to determine, for the different chalcogen atoms, which other few descriptors likewise considerably influence the adsorption properties. Our results show that when combined with interpretable ML protocols, EHM can produce a scalable framework for choosing 2D structures that exhibit the desired capture/release dynamics pertinent in a variety of utilization."

    "abstract": "We study the free energy and dynamics of a closed elastic filament (a one-dimensional curve in two dimensions) whose local internal state is specified by curvature, stretch, and a scalar density field representing, for example, the concentration of an absorbed species. The density variable has a tendency to phase-separate whereas the local spontaneous curvature is concentration-dependent. There is also a coupling between concentration and the stretching of the filament, although our main interest is in the nearly inextensible regime. We formulate and simulate the dynamics, comprising a coupled Willmore flow and Cahn-Hilliard gradient flow on the full differential geometry of a closed filament, addressing issues that previous work typically sidestepped by restricting to the Monge gauge. We use a numerical strategy for global free energy minimization, presenting the equilibrium shapes and density profiles across a wide range of model parameters. The phase diagram is dominated by a relatively small number of simple shapes that exhibit, as expected, strong coupling between local curvature and concentration. We also find regimes where curvature and/or stretching energies suppress phase separation altogether. For selected parameter values we present fully dynamical results, tracking the time evolution of the various contributions to the free energy. The dynamics often arrive at metastable minima rather than the equilibrium state - for example, at states with more than the minimum number of interfaces between coexisting phases. The metastability of these states is absent for phase separation on a rigid circular domain and thus a direct result of the coupling between geometry and density."

The inference pipeline integrates a vision-enabled large language model, BERT- based medical entity extraction, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement prior to expert review. Evaluation on 21 dermatological cases (21 complete AI physician pairs) em- ployed a four-level concordance framework comprising exact primary match rate (PMR), semantic similarity-adjusted rate (AMR), cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate (CCR). Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment.

We investigate the relationship between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size ($N$), dataset size ($D$), and compute budget ($C$). Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size. Furthermore, we analyze model shape and uncover scaling behaviors that differ fundamentally from those observed in language models: weather forecasting models consistently favor increased width over depth. These findings suggest that future weather models should prioritize wider architectures and larger effective training datasets to maximize predictive performance."

To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-NeuroOnco, a large-scale multimodal benchmark and instruction-tuning dataset for brain tumor MRI understanding, consisting of 24,726 MRI slices from 20 data sources paired with approximately 200,000 semantically enriched multimodal instructions spanning diverse tumor subtypes and imaging modalities. To mitigate the scarcity and high cost of diagnostic semantic annotations, we develop a multi-model collaborative pipeline for automated medical information completion and quality control, enabling the generation of diagnosis-related semantics beyond mask-only annotations. Building upon this dataset, we further construct MM-NeuroOnco-Bench, a manually annotated evaluation benchmark with a rejection-aware setting to reduce biases inherent in closed-ended question formats. Evaluation across ten representative models shows that even the strongest baseline, Gemini 3 Flash, achieves only 41.88% accuracy on diagnosis-related questions, highlighting the substantial challenges of multimodal brain tumor diagnostic understanding. Leveraging MM-NeuroOnco, we further propose NeuroOnco-GPT, which achieves a 27% absolute accuracy improvement on diagnostic questions following fine-tuning. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our dataset and benchmark in advancing clinically grounded multimodal diagnostic reasoning.

    "abstract": "Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is frequently performed on patients in intensive care units for prolonged mechanical ventilation. The needle puncture, as the most critical step of PDT, could lead to adverse consequences such as major bleeding and posterior tracheal wall perforation if performed inaccurately. Current practices of PDT puncture are all performed manually with no navigation assistance, which leads to large position and angular errors (5 mm and 30 degree). To improve the accuracy and reduce the difficulty of the PDT procedure, we propose a system that automates the needle insertion using a velocity-controlled robotic manipulator. Guided using pose data from two electromagnetic sensors, one at the needle tip and the other inside the trachea, the robotic system uses an adaptive constrained controller to adapt the uncertain kinematic parameters online and avoid collisions with the patient's body and tissues near the target. Simulations were performed to validate the controller's implementation, and then four hundred PDT punctures were performed on a mannequin to evaluate the position and angular accuracy. The absolute median puncture position error was 1.7 mm (IQR: 1.9 mm) and midline deviation was 4.13 degree (IQR: 4.55 degree), measured by the sensor inside the trachea. The small deviations from the nominal puncture in a simulated experimental setup and formal guarantees of collision-free insertions suggest the feasibility of the robotic PDT puncture."

Although more complex descriptors may improve numerical accuracy, they often represent extra computational load, also reducing transparency into the underlying structural information. A framework called the Dynamic Collision Fingerprint (DCF) was recently proposed with the goal of producing concise, physically significant representations, generating descriptors via dynamical probing of atomic structures. In this work, we benchmark DCF using a dataset composed of 120 two-dimensional carbon allotropes and compare its performance with the widely considered Matminer library. The analysis employs three regression models, linear regression, decision tree, and XGBoost, evaluated over train and test partitions ranging from 10\\% to 90\\% and repeated over multiple random seeds in order to characterize statistical variability. The obtained results demonstrate that DCF easily matches Matminer in terms of predicting accuracy across all learning algorithms. However, it accomplishes this using descriptors that are significantly lower dimensional, pointing to manageable computing costs. Moreover, compared to the rather technical Matminer descriptions, the DCF exhibits considerably clearer physical interpretability. These findings suggest that DCF is a significant substitute for high-dimensional descriptor libraries as structural representation since it is both computationally flexible and physically grounded."

Although minimum cut admits efficient classical solutions, it is a fundamental component of more complex network optimization problems such as multicut and network interdiction. Our objective is to examine quantum models in which feasibility is preserved by the mixer dynamics, without introducing penalty terms in the cost Hamiltonian. We employ a ring structured XY mixer that restricts the quantum evolution to the subspace of valid cut configurations, ensuring that all sampled states correspond to feasible solutions. To address scalability limitations, we suggest an iterative metaheuristic strategy that decomposes large instances into smaller subproblems solved sequentially using the same quantum model. The results obtained using the mixer indicate that the initial probability distribution can be systematically controlled, thereby enabling the development of warm start techniques within variational quantum based algorithms."

Also, the optical behavior is investigated via a systematic analysis of the photon sphere and the associated BH shadow, emphasizing possible observational features capable of differentiating this configuration from classical models. We also analyze the motion of test particles, focusing on how surrounding matter components affect trajectories, stability conditions, and effective potentials. Scalar field perturbations are considered to investigate the BH response to external excitations and to extract information regarding its dynamical properties. In this case, the thermodynamic behavior of the system is studied, including the role of string clouds and dark matter in modifying BH thermodynamic quantities.

The rotational-to-translational temperature ratio and the proportionality between the spin-spin and stress tensors are shown to be independent of the coefficient of normal restitution and determined solely by roughness and moment of inertia. The reduced normal stresses, shear stress, and shear rate are obtained explicitly in terms of two effective parameters generalizing the cooling and stress relaxation rates of the smooth model. From these results we derive exact expressions for the non-Newtonian shear viscosity, the first viscometric function, and the friction coefficient. The dependence of the rheological properties on the normal and tangential restitution coefficients is analyzed in detail, revealing strong non-Newtonian behavior and nonmonotonic effects of roughness. The results reduce, in the appropriate limits, to those of the inelastic Maxwell model for smooth particles and to the Pidduck gas in the elastic perfectly rough case."

To lift the requirement of labeled seed pairs that are difficult to obtain, recent methods shifted to an unsupervised paradigm using pseudo-alignment seeds. However, unsupervised entity alignment in multimodal settings remains underexplored, mainly because the incorporation of multimodal information often results in imbalanced coverage of pseudo-seeds within the knowledge graph. To overcome this, we propose PSQE (Pseudo-Seed Quality Enhancement) to improve the precision and graph coverage balance of pseudo seeds via multimodal information and clustering-resampling. Theoretical analysis reveals the impact of pseudo seeds on existing contrastive learning-based MMEA models. In particular, pseudo seeds can influence the attraction and the repulsion terms in contrastive learning at once, whereas imbalanced graph coverage causes models to prioritize high-density regions, thereby weakening their learning capability for entities in sparse regions. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings and show that PSQE as a plug-and-play module can improve the performance of baselines by considerable margins."

    "abstract": "This essay fuses concepts and approaches used to describe fluctuating phenomena in climate systems and statistical mechanics, and explores new ideas essential for understanding such phenomena. Its starting points are the Langevin equation (LE) and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). The former was introduced to climate research by Klaus Hasselmann through his stochastic climate models. While a version of the latter, formulated within the framework of linear response theory, has found wide application, the deeper origin of the relation between fluctuations and dissipation has remained inconclusive. This essay goes one step further by seeking the cause of the apparent randomness, rather than merely describing it as in the LE, and by directly linking a fluctuation-dissipation relation to the governing microscopic equations. It postulates that such a relation, also referred to as the integral fluctuation-dissipation relation (IFDR), resides in integrals of the forcings that determine microscopic evolutions (individual trajectories) of the considered system. The IFDR ensures the emergence of well-defined macroscopic quantities, such as variance and spectra, quantities that characterize the system's fluctuations, provided the system is in dynamical equilibrium with constant external forcing. It is the dissipation embodied in IFDR that renders future states uncorrelated with initial conditions, thereby generating apparent randomness. Randomness is therefore not an unphysical artifact; on the contrary, it is a fundamental property of forced-dissipative systems in dynamical equilibrium. Fluctuation phenomena in such systems must be described by two principles: the governing microscopic equations and the IFDR. The two principles are complementary but not reducible to one another."

    "abstract": "The amount of extractable work from a physical system is fundamentally connected to the information available about its state, as illustrated by Maxwell's demon and the Gibbs paradox. In standard thermodynamic protocols involving system--bath interactions, the maximum work is given by the free-energy difference between the initial state and the corresponding Gibbs state at the bath temperature. This motivates a natural question: does information also limit work extraction in closed quantum systems that do not involve a heat bath and where work is obtained through unitary operations generated by a time-dependent Hamiltonian? While ergotropy quantifies the maximum work extractable via unitary operations, it assumes complete knowledge of the quantum state, typically requiring full state tomography. In realistic scenarios, however, only partial information is accessible. In this case, the relevant figure of merit is observational ergotropy, which depends explicitly on the measurement used to probe the system. We show that observational ergotropy decreases under classical post-processing of measurement outcomes, implying that fine-grained measurements allow greater work extraction than coarse-grained ones. Moreover, maximizing observational ergotropy over all possible measurements recovers standard ergotropy, which decomposes into incoherent (classical) and coherent (quantum) contributions. Our results demonstrate that coherence in the measurement projectors constitutes the key resource, enabling work extraction beyond the incoherent limit and establishing coherence as the origin of quantum advantage in observational ergotropy extraction."

Specifically, we examine the impact and choice of its tuning parameter, which regulates the degree of effective dimension reduction applied to the data, and propose a random projection-based approach for its efficient computation, supported by theoretical justification. Through comprehensive numerical studies, we explore a wide range of statistical applications of the RPD and demonstrate its particular usefulness in uncovering shape features in functional data analysis. This ability allows the RPD to outperform competing depth-based methods, especially in tasks such as functional outlier detection, classification, and two-sample hypothesis testing."

We show that any reconstruction-consistent autoencoder atlas canonically defines transition maps satisfying the cocycle condition, and that linearising these transition maps yields a vector bundle coinciding with the tangent bundle when the latent dimension matches the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. This construction provides direct access to differential-topological invariants of the data. In particular, we show that the first Stiefel-Whitney class can be computed from the signs of the Jacobians of learned transition maps, yielding an algorithmic criterion for detecting orientability. We also show that non-trivial characteristic classes provide obstructions to single-chart representations, and that the minimum number of autoencoder charts is determined by the good cover structure of the manifold. Finally, we apply our methodology to low-dimensional orientable and non-orientable manifolds, as well as to a non-orientable high-dimensional image dataset."

We investigate how the $F$-isolation number $ι(G,F)$ of a graph $G$ is affected by the minimum degree $d$ of $G$, establishing a bounded range, in terms of $d$ and the orders of $F$ and $G$, for the largest possible value of $ι(G,F)$ with $d$ sufficiently large. We also investigate how close $ι(G,tF)$ is to $ι(G,F)$, using domination and, in suitable cases, the Erdos-Posa property."

However, this strategy faces two critical challenges: large-scale medical datasets often contain substantial redundancy and severe class imbalance that bias representation learning toward over-represented patterns, and indiscriminate training regardless of heterogeneity in data quality incurs considerable computational inefficiency. Here we demonstrate that active, principled data curation during pretraining can serve as a viable, cost-effective alternative to brute-force dataset enlargement. We introduce CheXficient, a chest X-ray (CXR) foundation model that selectively prioritizes informative training samples. CheXficient is pretrained on only 22.7% of 1,235,004 paired CXR images and reports while consuming under 27.3% of the total compute budget, yet achieving comparable or superior performance to its full-data counterpart and other large-scale pretrained models. We assess CheXficient across 20 individual benchmarks spanning 5 task types, including non-adapted off-the-shelf evaluations (zero-shot findings classification and crossmodal retrieval) and adapted downstream tasks (disease prediction, semantic segmentation, and radiology report generation). Further analyses show that CheXficient systematically prioritizes under-represented training samples, improving generalizability on long-tailed or rare conditions. Overall, our work offers practical insights into the data and computation demands for efficient pretraining and downstream adaptation of medical vision-language foundation models."

A continuum of producers operate Cobb-Douglas technologies with regime-specific productivity $A_j \\in \\{A_L, A_H\\}$. Stochastic arrival of signaling opportunities and skill obsolescence risk generate an optimal stopping problem -- when to pay a lump-sum cost $φ$ to upgrade productivity -- whose solution yields an endogenous Skiba threshold $k^*$. Diminishing returns create a stable interior attractor in each regime; the signaling cost separates the two basins, producing a poverty trap that is an interior optimum rather than a corner solution. The stationary distribution exhibits Twin Peaks, but its decomposition by regime reveals that agents in three distinct states -- structurally trapped, waiting to signal, and successfully upgraded -- coexist at the same wealth levels with different consumption behavior and mobility prospects. Capital alone is therefore insufficient to identify an agent's position in the polarization dynamics. We show that the joint observation of a low marginal propensity to consume out of wealth and a high average propensity to consume -- a combination invisible to standard Euler equation tests -- is the diagnostic signature of the structural trap, distinguishing it from both liquidity constraints and transitory shocks."

    "abstract": "Face aging, an ill-posed problem shaped by environmental and genetic factors, is vital in entertainment, forensics, and digital archiving, where realistic age transformations must preserve both identity and visual realism. However, existing works relying on numerical age representations overlook the interplay of biological and contextual cues. Despite progress in recent face aging models, they struggle with identity preservation in wide age transformations, also static attention and optimization-heavy inversion in diffusion limit adaptability, fine-grained control and background consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Face Time Traveller (FaceTT), a diffusion-based framework that achieves high-fidelity, identity-consistent age transformation. Here, we introduce a Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement strategy that encodes intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental) aging cues for context-aware conditioning. A tuning-free Angular Inversion method is proposed that efficiently maps real faces into the diffusion latent space for fast and accurate reconstruction. Moreover, an Adaptive Attention Control mechanism is introduced that dynamically balances cross-attention for semantic aging cues and self-attention for structural and identity preservation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and in-the-wild testset demonstrate that FaceTT achieves superior identity retention, background preservation and aging realism over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."

Specifically, PhotoAgent formulates autonomous image editing as a long-horizon decision-making problem. It reasons over user aesthetic intent, plans multi-step editing actions via tree search, and iteratively refines results through closed-loop execution with memory and visual feedback, without requiring step-by-step user prompts. To support reliable evaluation in real-world scenarios, we introduce UGC-Edit, an aesthetic evaluation benchmark consisting of 7,000 photos and a learned aesthetic reward model. We also construct a test set containing 1,017 photos to systematically assess autonomous photo editing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhotoAgent consistently improves both instruction adherence and visual quality compared with baseline methods.

A flexible setup combining spectral and phase shaping of both pump and local oscillator fields with frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection is employed to examine how intracavity dispersion influences squeezing. Different cavity configurations with varying finesse and dispersion conditions are studied, and the squeezing is measured as a function of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth. Contrary to expectations based on existing theoretical models, the measured squeezing levels remain essentially unchanged as dispersion varies. To account for these observations, a modeling approach is introduced in which intracavity dispersion is described as an effective spectral filtering occurring at the stage of SPOPO supermode generation. Within this framework, the filtering is incorporated directly into the interaction Hamiltonian of the nonlinear process. This perspective establishes a consistent experimental benchmark for the study of dispersion in SPOPOs and underscores the importance of spectral filtering in the interpretation of multimode squeezing experiments."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multi-mutation optimization algorithm, Differential Evolution with Multi-Mutation Operator-Guided Communication (DE-MMOGC), implemented to improve the performance and convergence abilities of standard differential evolution in uncertain environments. DE-MMOGC introduces a communication-guided scheme integrated with multiple mutation operators to encourage exploration and avoid premature convergence. Along with this, it includes a dynamic operator selection mechanism to use the best-performing operator over successive generations. To assimilate real-world uncertainties and missing observations into the predictive model, the proposed algorithm is combined with the Ensemble Kalman Filter. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed DE-MMOGC in uncertain systems, the unified framework is applied to improve the predictive accuracy of crop simulation models. These simulation models are essential to precision agriculture, as they make it easier to estimate crop growth in a variety of unpredictable weather scenarios. Additionally, precisely calibrating these models raises a challenge due to missing observations. Hence, the simplified WOFOST crop simulation model is incorporated in this study for leaf area index (LAI)-based crop yield estimation. DE-MMOGC enhances the WOFOST performance by optimizing crucial weather parameters (temperature and rainfall), since these parameters are highly uncertain across different crop varieties, such as wheat, rice, and cotton. The experimental study shows that DE-MMOGC outperforms the traditional evolutionary optimizers and achieves better correlation with real LAI values. We found that DE-MMOGC is a resilient solution for crop monitoring."

However, these sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumption of linear and perfectly molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this mismatch, we propose several detectors and transmission schemes for a molecule mixture communication system where the receiver (RX) employs non-linear, cross-reactive sensors. All proposed schemes are based on the first- and second-order moments of the symbol likelihoods that are fed through the non-linear RX using the Unscented Transform. In particular, we propose an approximate maximum likelihood (AML) symbol-by-symbol detector for inter-symbol-interference (ISI)-free transmission scenarios and a complementary mixture alphabet design algorithm which accounts for the RX characteristics. When significant ISI is present at high data rates, the AML detector can be adapted to exploit statistical ISI knowledge. Additionally, we propose a sequence detector which combines information from multiple symbol intervals. For settings where sequence detection is not possible due to extremely limited computational power at the RX, we propose an adaptive transmission scheme which can be combined with symbol-by-symbol detection. Using computer simulations, we validate all proposed detectors and algorithms based on the responses of commercially available sensors as well as artificially generated sensor data incorporating the characteristics of metal-oxide semiconductor sensors. By employing a general system model that accounts for transmitter noise, ISI, and general non-linear, cross-reactive RX arrays, this work enables reliable communication for a large class of MC systems."

Deep learning-based methods tend to obtain a fixed model, which is difficult to adapt to the dynamic scenarios with increasing fault classes. To address the above problems, an extensible framework based on graph-guided sample replay for motor incremental fault diagnosis (GSRIFD) is proposed in this paper. First, a dynamic and extensible model updating mechanism is proposed, which achieves a balance between the old and new knowledge and avoids complex network branches by sharing general feature representation layers and adjusting high-level feature extraction layers. Second, a representative exemplars selection mechanism is proposed to select the most representative exemplars by constructing a relation graph based on similarity. In addition, knowledge distillation (KD) is introduced to assist training to extract the knowledge of the old model. The framework can establish an adaptive diagnostic model with stable performance in dynamic industrial scenarios. Finally, experiments are conducted on induction motor (IM) and permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of GSRIFD."

    "abstract": "Accurate identification and positioning of multiple vehicles is a critical challenge in autonomous driving, particularly over long distances. While sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) methods have shown promise in radar-based direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation due to the superior signal reconstruction capabilities, their performance degrades in multi-vehicle scenarios, often resulting in target loss or reduced positioning accuracy. To address this, we propose an enhanced two-stage SBL algorithm for high-precision multi-vehicle localization in MIMO frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar systems. Specifically, the proposed algorithm employs a hierarchical two-stage framework. In the first stage, a coarse search is conducted over sparsely sampled grids to efficiently identify potential target regions while significantly reducing computational complexity. In the second stage, an iterative refinement process is applied within locally constructed high-resolution grids to achieve precise joint range and angle estimation. To further enhance estimation robustness, a Sigmoid-based local maximization mechanism is incorporated to mitigate sidelobe interference resulting from dictionary coherence. Moreover, an iterative interference cancellation strategy is employed to mitigate mutual interference among targets, thereby enhancing localization reliability and parameter estimation precision for multiple vehicles. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves millimeter-level range accuracy and sub-degree angular precision, outperforming existing methods in both estimation accuracy and runtime efficiency. Field tests further validate the algorithm’s effectiveness in reliable target localization in practical multi-vehicle scenarios."

This integration enables adaptive updates with improved robustness to uncertainties, offering a new approach that combines stochastic filtering with reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "Accurate underwater localization is crucial for autonomous underwater vehicles, yet it remains challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of marine environments. Traditional localization methods that rely on anchor nodes and precise synchronization often fail to adapt to real-world underwater acoustic channel conditions characterized by multipath effects, high attenuation, and significant variability. Recent advances in deep learning offer model-free approaches that mitigate some of these issues, but they still struggle with generalization in scenarios with limited data. In this study, we introduce the application of attentive neural processes (ANPs) to underwater localization, enhancing both accuracy and robustness through effective uncertainty modeling and dynamic adaptation based on observed context data. By leveraging the ANP framework, our approach paves the way for extensive offline pretraining on simulated data, followed by rapid few-shot adaptation under real conditions; in this work, we evaluate near-zero-shot generalization. This strategy not only improves predictive performance but also significantly reduces the need for large-scale real-world data, making it highly suitable for dynamic underwater environments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ANPs significantly outperform traditional multilayer perceptron approaches, achieving reductions in mean absolute error of up to 25% compared to standard baselines. These results highlight the potential of ANPs to deliver reliable, adaptable, and precise localization solutions in challenging underwater scenarios."

To address these issues, a method is proposed that compensates for projection distortion via deep-learning-based local surface-normal estimation and achieves robust viewpoint control along complex 3-D seam trajectories using prior geometric approximation of the seam trajectory. For normal estimation, seam features are encoded as “point-vector pair” superpixels and extracted by a single-stage deep convolutional network, enabling efficient, robust detection under welding glare, spatter, smoke, and reflections while maintaining boundary stability. Using the “point-vector pair” representation, the laser incidence direction is adaptively adjusted with reference to estimated surface normals to reduce pose uncertainty caused by projection distortion. For viewpoint control, a feedforward leading-direction control algorithm, derived from geometric–numerical analysis of predefined trajectory, ensures stable perception and high-precision continuous tracking along tight curves and right-angle turns. Across two experiments involving different workpiece geometries, the method achieves mean absolute laser focal position errors of 0.16 and 0.20 mm and mean absolute 3-D laser incident-direction errors of 0.99<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> and 1.58<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula>, validating its efficiency, stability, and accuracy for sheet-metal laser seam tracking."

    "abstract": "Bridge type mechanical lap joints with indium foil insertion have been developed for joint winding of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) helical coils in heliotron‑type stellarator fusion reactors. While joints between copper-stabilized Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxide (REBCO) tapes have demonstrated consistently low resistance, their long-term stability remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we first quantified volumetric resistivity of CuIn2 formed at the Cu/In interface using a mechanical lap joint of copper-stabilized REBCO tapes with indium insertion based on four-terminal resistance measurement and cross-sectional Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analysis. Subsequently, we evaluated the time-dependent evolution of joint resistivity under different pre-treatment conditions (with or without ethanol cleaning) and storage temperatures (300 K or 77 K). Based on these results, a model was developed to separate diffusion-driven and non-diffusional contributions to joint resistivity. The results revealed that storage at 300 K leads to a monotonic increase in joint resistivity, primarily due to CuIn2 growth, while storage at 77 K suppresses such changes. Additionally, in samples not treated with ethanol cleaning, a significant increase in resistivity occurring with a delay at 300 K was observed, consistent with corrosion-related mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Estimating the three-dimensional (3D) shape of tendon-driven continuum robots (TDCRs) under sparse pose measurements and unknown tip forces remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel Lie algebra-based probabilistic framework for continuous-arclength shape reconstruction of variable-curvature TDCRs subjected to unknown tip loads. By unifying Cosserat-rod and Cosserat-string theories, a Lie algebra-coupled static model is established that explicitly represents tendon actuation as distributed wrenches along the robot’s backbone. A sparse Gaussian Process prior in se(3) is derived via linearization to encode actuation-coupled shape distributions. This prior is fused with sparse, noisy pose measurements from electromagnetic sensors in a continuous-arclength batch estimation framework, enabling uncertainty-aware reconstruction along the backbone. Simulations and experiments on single-segment prototypes under diverse tip-loading conditions validate the method’s efficacy. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accurate shape estimation, with average shape (tip) errors of 1.6% (2.5%) of the total length, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Comparable precision on helical-routing TDCR further confirms the framework’s generalizability."

Network Digital Twins (NDTs) promise this capability, yet current efforts in research and industry are fragmented and lack widely accepted formal definitions and architectural guidelines. This paper proposes a structured framework for NDTs in 6G, addressing these gaps by refining the conceptual foundations of NDTs, introducing a functional architecture, inherited from the 6G-TWIN EU consortium, and clarifying key components such as AI-driven workflows, the place of simulation, data management, and orchestration. Concrete examples illustrate how these components enable network automation, optimization, and predictive analytics. The paper proceeds by reviewing related work and standardization efforts, specifying functional and non-functional requirements, presenting the architecture and its various domains, and detailing lifecycle management across cloud to edge. We then report early implementations and evaluation results, and discuss security, privacy, and governance considerations, concluding with directions for validation and uptake. The key objective is to offer a cohesive reference model that guides the community in shaping NDT development, ensuring interoperability, scalability, adaptability, and seamless integration into AI-native 6G networks for improved intelligence and efficiency."

    "abstract": "In recent years, while the overall seismic activity in China has remained relatively stable, the characteristics of high frequency, high intensity, and wide distribution persist, posing a significant threat to the safety of power transmission corridors. Earthquakes are typically considered as a singlepoint excitation source. To investigate the effects of both singlepoint and multi-point excitations on a transmission tower-line system, this paper develops a finite element (FE) model of a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 0 0 k V}$</tex> “three-tower, two-line” Direct Current (DC) transmission system based on an actual engineering project. The model was established by comprehensively considering material and geometric nonlinearities and through the appropriate selection of element types. Subsequently, artificial multi-point seismic waves, conforming to realistic conditions, were generated based on the number of excitation points and their distances from the transmission towers. The results indicate that, under both excitation scenarios, the structural responses induced by multi-point excitation are greater than those induced by single-point excitation. In terms of member stress response, the calculated stresses in the primary members of the towers exhibit a decreasing trend with increasing tower height, regardless of whether the seismic input is one-dimensional or two-dimensional. Furthermore, due to the more pronounced restraining effect of the transmission lines on the end towers, these towers are subjected to greater lateral forces during an earthquake. The findings of this study provide a practical reference for the stability analysis and reinforcement of DC transmission towers under seismic conditions."

This paper introduces the Hook-in-CBEWS Framework, a proposed behavioral design framework that integrates the Hook Model phases (Trigger, Action, Reward, and Investment) into the four core elements of CBEWS. Developed through the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) combined with the Best-Fit Framework Synthesis (BFFS), this study conducted a preliminary verification focusing on conceptual feasibility and stakeholder acceptability (DSRM Activity 4), establishing a necessary foundation prior to behavioral validation. Empirical and theoretical triangulation was conducted using mixed methods involving small-scale fishermen in Parangtritis, Yogyakarta. Nineteen design patterns classified as critical were identified, providing structured behavioral mechanisms that align with user needs and contextual characteristics observed in the field. The framework offers a prescriptive conceptual foundation for sustainable engagement design and provides empirically grounded design patterns that can guide prototype development. Future work will extend this foundation through prototype deployment and longitudinal behavioral evaluation."

    "abstract": "The study introduces an intrusion detection architecture based on the modularity of the network that includes Large Language Models (LLMs), to support accurate determination of complex network anomalies, especially focusing on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack techniques. The underlying model uses Llama3, which has been optimized with PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning). When combined with QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation), it minimizes computational resource consumption. A new algorithm transforms structured network flow data to a natural language format. This makes it acceptable for LLMs to absorb instructions. It creates operational efficiency within the framework due to its simplicity and ability simplify later labor steps of word count and conversion back into codes. Also added is a feature selection stage, using the Pearson coefficient, to effectively manage data dimension. When the approach is evaluated in four different datasets (CIC-IDS2017, CIC-DDoS2019, CIC-IoT2023 and InSDN), it shows robust performance: the non-DDoS categories are consistently very accurate (ACC <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\geq 0.999$</tex>) with extremely low False Positive Rates (FPR <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\leq \\mathbf{0. 0 0 0 9}$</tex>). This was at variance from the test given in the CIC-DDoS2019 data, where for the DDoS model both ACC and FPR were observed fall dramatically, from 0.9879 to 0.9770 and from 0.0106 to 0.0183 respectively, across various classifiable models. These findings have two aspects. The system must accurately discriminate standard network traffic from complex DDoS attack signatures and clearly articulate the unique properties of those threats. This in consequence calls for an urgent investigation of feature optimization and tactical adjustment of thresholds, both required to reinforce network resilience against such sophisticated cyber-attack forms."

Secondly, the impact of the main signal latching fault on the operation of the valve control system is verified through simulation, and the root cause of the fault is located by combining the duty logic of the main/standby sets. Finally, two types of rectification measures are proposed: “adding reset logic” and “independent power supply configuration”. The proposed scheme can effectively solve the main signal latching problem, improve the operation reliability of the valve control system, and provide technical reference for the design of the valve control system in subsequent UHVDC flexible DC projects."

Secondly, an energy function describing the boundary is constructed based on active contour model, which converts the optimization problem of boundary to a numerical optimization problem. Finally, quasi-Newton method is employed to effectively minimize the energy and obtain refined boundaries. The experiments on the dataset show that compared with the baseline model, our model can get the MIoU of 73.6 % and boundary F-measure of 78.9 %.

The accuracy of wind speed retrieval directly depends on the peak finding accuracy of signal processing of CWL. Firstly, according to the construction of a 1.5μm CWL system, the kernel density estimation model is determined as the noise fitting model with the best noise, and the noise baseline is determined. Then, an adaptive threshold peak retrieval algorithm based on morphological filtering and gradient detection is proposed. The algorithm achieves accurate peak search through multi-feature fusion and threshold screening. The final experiment shows that the algorithm can stably and accurately identify one peak in each measurement, and the highest confidence is 0.906, which effectively solves the problem of multi-peak misjudgment and insufficient confidence inherent in the traditional method. The algorithm improves the accuracy of Doppler frequency shift extraction, thereby supporting precise wind speed measurement with CWL."

Our quantitative resolution analysis shows that our most difficult-to-detect feature, Periapical Lesions (AP 0.03), still maintains a significant and detectable average size ($\\sim 14 \\times 50$ pixels) after resizing. This indicates a fundamental failure, rather than a superficial one. We conclude that this failure likely stems from the combined effects of extreme labeled data scarcity and highlights the limitations of MAE for downstream object detection tasks."

In order to achieve this purpose, analytical methods were used in combination with simulation modeling methods for adjusting the parameters of the mathematical model of the control object. The study focuses on drum mills in the ore preparation technological line before beneficiation. . From the perspective of control, drum mills are nonlinear, nonstationary objects with significant inertia. These factors significantly complicate the task of determining an adequate mathematical model of the object for control. To solve this problem, an identification method was proposed that combines the positive properties of parametric and nonparametric methods, based on the use of a non-traditional criterion for the quality of model adjustment – the sample correlation ratio. The identification method ensures a high speed of selection of operational information about an object; is universal in terms of the object structure; takes into account the presence of nonlinear elements in the composition of the object, and is minimally sensitive to the effects of disturbances. The result of the identification is the determination of the parameters of linear operators and the assessment of the type of characteristic of the nonlinear element as part of the object model."

Finally, the length and width of each branch are calculated, and three width measurement methods are compared. Experimental results demonstrate that the relative error for branch length measurements ranges from 2% to 7%.

In comparison to the state of the art literature, our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with lower computational cost (without ensemble). While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods.

This paper proposes an improved ADC (Availability, Dependability, Capability) evaluation framework integrated with a combined weighting method to assess the interoperability level of unmanned systems. The ADC model, originally developed by the Weapon System Effectiveness Industry Advisory Committee (WSEIAC) in 1965, is adapted to reflect the unique characteristics of unmanned systems, including protocol compatibility, data exchange efficiency, survivability in contested environments, and functional resilience in degraded modes. To address the complexity of weighting determination in interoperability metrics, a combined weighting approach is introduced, balancing subjective weights derived from the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and objective weights based on entropy method. The subjective weights incorporate expert judgment on tactical priorities, while the objective weights are calculated from multi-user evaluation data. The two are fused using a relative entropy minimization model to form a balanced combined weight. A case study on \"node connectivity\", a subdimension of interoperability, demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method. The results show that the combined weighting effectively integrates expert experience and empirical data, providing a comprehensive and practical evaluation tool for unmanned system interoperability."

First, a dynamic model of the AUV is established based on the physical characteristics of the underwater environment. Then, a feasibility-checking function is incorporated into the action selection stage, while physics-based constraint terms—related to motion smoothness, attitude stability, and environmental adaptability—are embedded into the reward and loss functions. In this way, environmental physics and dynamic constraints are integrated into the learning framework of the Deep Q-Network. Finally, through simulation training and validation, a policy model is obtained and tested for its obstacle-avoidance and path-planning performance in a designed underwater environment. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional DRL and NMPC algorithms, the proposed method achieves superior performance in obstacle avoidance success rate and path smoothness, with path smoothness improved by 0.06–0.12 and trajectory length reduced by approximately 3%. The results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits stronger adaptability and robustness, significantly enhancing the AUV’s autonomous obstacle-avoidance and trajectory-planning capabilities in complex dynamic environments, and providing an effective solution for physically reliable underwater intelligent control."

To address these issues, we propose DMF-MH, a Dual-stage Modality-aware Fusion framework specifically designed to mitigate modality heterogeneity in MMKGC. In the first stage, we employ modality-specific encoders to extract independent semantic features, and utilize a bilinear fusion mechanism combined with contrastive learning to explicitly model cross-modal interactions while enforcing alignment between modalities of the same entity. In the second stage, we implement a decision-level fusion strategy that integrates the predictions of each modality using learned reliability-aware weights, enabling robust and adaptive inference.

    "abstract": "Natural ester insulating oils are increasingly adopted in power transformers due to their high biodegradability and fire safety. However, the long-term reliability of ester-filled transformers is critically dependent on the compatibility between ester oils and solid insulation materials. In this paper, a 120 °C oil-immersion accelerated aging model, equivalent to five years of service according to IEC 62770, is established to systematically investigate the physical, chemical, and electrical compatibility of five representative insulation materials. A multi-scale evaluation framework combining dimensional stability, dissolution behavior, and dielectric performance is proposed. The results reveal that cellulose-based and crosslinked epoxy materials exhibit intrinsic compatibility with natural ester oil, while polyester film suffers severe degradation and significantly deteriorates oil dielectric properties. Based on these findings, material selection criteria are formulated and applied to the design and manufacturing of two 400 kVA natural ester transformer prototypes. Factory test results confirm the engineering feasibility of the proposed compatibility-driven design strategy."

    "abstract": "Accurately forecasting multi-energy loads is crucial for optimally dispatching and economically operating integrated energy systems (IES). However, most methods commonly ignore the correlation in multi-energy and the global information in long-term series. To solve these issues, we propose a hybrid model based on the Mamba and Graph Convolutional Networks (Mamba-GCN). Specifically, we use GCN to capture the correlation between different energies. In contrast to the implicit learning rules of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which learn local patterns within a grid structure, GCN uses a known graph structure that describes the relationships between features or entities to handle correlations. To obtain global information in long-time series, Mamba network is introduced to model cross-time period correlations on a global scale. The effectiveness of the proposed Mamba-GCN is verified using multi-energy load data from Arizona State University."

    "abstract": "Cyberattacks on networks remain a critical threat, emphasizing the need for proactive defense mechanisms. Although machine learning–based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have progressed in detecting threats, their effectiveness is limited to the detection stage and rarely extends to preventive recommendations. This limitation stems from the absence of preventive labels in publicly available datasets, leading to reactive models. To address this gap, this study enriches the benchmark IDS dataset, NSL-KDD, with preventive labels. The methodology includes attack pattern analysis, formulation of mitigation labels, cross-validation with the MITRE CAPEC framework, and expert evaluation. Results show that more than 82.5% of the proposed labels align with appropriate preventive actions, while the remaining were considered inconsistent with actual mitigation strategies. These findings highlight the need to balance tactical responses and a strengthened security posture. The main contribution of this study is a ready-to-use enriched dataset that facilitates the development of next-generation AI models capable of not only detecting but also recommending preventive measures, thereby supporting faster incident response and enhancing cybersecurity resilience."

    "abstract": "Behavior recognition has become a fundamental task in computer vision with broad applications in intelligent surveillance, human-computer interaction, and smart security systems. However, complex real-world scenarios present significant challenges, including occlusion, illumination variation, viewpoint changes, and background clutter, which severely degrade recognition performance. Existing methods primarily rely on fixed-scale feature extraction and single-dimensional attention mechanisms, limiting their robustness in complex environments. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention Mechanism (AMSAM) for robust behavior recognition. The proposed method employs a multi-branch convolutional architecture to capture spatiotemporal features at small, medium, and large scales simultaneously. An adaptive attention module integrating spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions is designed to dynamically evaluate feature importance across different scales. Furthermore, a feature alignment and adaptive weighted fusion strategy is developed to enable deep integration of multi-scale information. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets UCF101 and HMDB51 demonstrate that AMSAM achieves recognition accuracies of 95.1% and 77.9%. Under challenging scenarios such as occlusion and illumination variation, the proposed method exhibits significantly improved robustness. The results validate the effectiveness and practical applicability of AMSAM for behavior recognition in complex scenarios."

    "abstract": "Optimizing yield in semiconductor manufacturing is economically critical but challenging because process data are kept highly confidential and anonymized. Traditional machine-learning methods rely on statistical correlations and cannot incorporate physical process knowledge, limiting model interpretability and transferability. We propose a multi-agent AutoML framework that uses large language and vision models to extract physics-based formulas from the literature and inject them into anonymized process data for feature construction. Five autonomous agents retrieve relevant papers, parse formulas, cluster the data, align abstract formula variables with data features, and construct interpretable formula-driven features. On the SECOM dataset, this knowledge-driven approach expands the feature set by 37.6% and improves AUC from 79.85% to 90.59%, with 81.8% of the top predictive features derived from literature formulas. A copula-based recommender then simulates process adjustments by shifting low-yield samples toward high-yield feature regions, raising the mean predicted yield probability from 0.15 to 0.76. Our framework demonstrates how cross-modal knowledge integration and multi-agent optimization can deliver transparent, transferable yield-improvement strategies under strict data confidentiality."

Utilizing historical weather data, a day-ahead prediction model for dynamic transmission capacity is developed. Through 100 days of historical data for training and validation, the proposed method can accurately output the maximum allowable hourly ampacity and transmission capacity for the following day, with prediction accuracy surpassing that of traditional models.

The dataset presents significant challenges due to its fine-grained structural complexity, necessitating models with advanced feature extraction capabilities and robust class-discriminative power. Despite the extensive use of CNNs in image classification, their limitations in capturing global spatial relationships motivated this study to explore the Vision Transformer (ViT) as a potential alternative. ViT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.8688 alongside closely aligned macro precision, recall, and F1-score values (0.8832, 0.8688, and 0.8694, respectively). These results highlight ViT’s ability to maintain balanced predictive performance across all classes, supported by its self-attention mechanisms that effectively represent intricate spatial relationships. This research contributes to the field by systematically comparing ViT and CNN-based architectures for batik classification, addressing the research gap in applying advanced machine learning techniques to preserve cultural heritage. Future work will focus on confidence calibration, robustness assessments, and detailed per-class error analysis to ensure the model’s reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios."

In this work, using the example of an electric bicycle drive system, it is shown how to determine the optimal conditions of BLDC motor electric braking from the point of view of the maximum recuperation power. The proposed LEV brake system is hybrid with an electric and friction brake subsystems that automatically complement each other, and the electric braking, if possible, is carried out according to the determined optimal trajectories.

    "abstract": "Coverage of points of interest (PoIs) is essential for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to achieve situation awareness and data collection. In some application scenarios, PoIs are unnecessary to be cover all the time. Therefore, it is more efficient and economical to schedule mobile sensors to cover PoIs periodically than use extensive static sensors to cover PoIs continuously, which motivates the research on sweep coverage. Mobile sensors should visit sinks (base stations) periodically within a given time or distance constraint so that they could be refueled or upload the collected data. To obtain a better sweep coverage scheme, most existing works only consider the cost of mobile sensors and study the sweep coverage problem with minimum mobile sensors. However, the deployment of sinks and their cost should also be considered. In this paper, we consider the minimum weight sweep coverage problem. We propose an approximation algorithm called A4MWSCS for this problem, whose approximation ratio is 3. We conduct simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of A4MWSCS and compare it with the related state-of-the-art algorithms. The simulation results show that our algorithm can obtain a smaller cost sweep coverage scheme for the problem."

The segmentation network leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone with a semantic segmentation architecture to achieve robust feature extraction and precise localization. For practical deployment, we design a seamless inference pipeline using an overlapping sliding window to process ultra-high-resolution images without artifacts. Furthermore, an application-specific post-processing step generates intuitive visualizations for industrial quality inspection. Our experiments demonstrate that this comprehensive approach significantly improves the detection accuracy of typographic defects, providing a robust and practical solution for automated quality assurance."

Recent studies have demonstrated Ferroelectric-capacitor-based memory (FeRAM) has the potential to support Non-Destructive Readout (NDRO) as well as 3D stacking, enabling read operations that do not disturb or minor disturb the stored polarization state and higher density. However, variations in ferroelectric materials and layer structures lead to diverse hysteresis behaviors, resulting in different sensing requirements. In addition, the reduced capacitor size in deeply stacked 3D architectures further decreases the available charge, making accurate readout increasingly challenging. To better understand these issues, this work presents a highly scalable direct-capacitance-conversion characterization circuit that is capable of extracting the equivalent ferroelectric capacitance from a 3D FeRAM array.

A modified field-oriented control structure is developed to ensure decoupled flux and speed regulation under open-circuit fault conditions. The proposed control integrates an adaptive proportional–integral–resonant (PIR) controller within a reconfigured stationary reference frame to maintain stable operation even during partial phase loss. By continuously adjusting its resonant frequency in response to real-time feedback, the controller achieves superior transient and steady-state performance. Experimental validation on a dSPACE DS1104 real time platform compares the performance of PI, PR, and PIR controllers. Results reveal that the conventional PI controller fails to sustain post-fault operation, while the adaptive PR controller enhances system continuity and dynamicrecovery. The proposed adaptive PIR controller further mitigates torque pulsations, reducing torque ripple from over 60% (PI-based) to approximately 10%, demonstrating significant improvement in fault-tolerant performance and robustness. This approach contributes to the development of reliable, self-healing industrial drive subsystems for next-generation smart manufacturing systems."

    "abstract": "Considering the rapid variations in frequently changing environment and the broadcast nature of wireless signals, security authentication plays a crucial role in ensuring the security of internet of vehicles (IoV) communications. Existing authentication schemes in IoV suffer from two main limitations: First, protocol-based authentication causes high latency and heavy cryptographic overhead when dealing with numerous concurrent requests. Second, although edge computing-assisted methods reduce cloud communication latency, the ability to support model adaptation across environments remains limited. To address these challenges, a blockchain-assisted meta-learning (BAML) authentication scheme is proposed for providing security authentication protection in IoV. Specifically, a meta-learning algorithm is designed to collaboratively learn the device/location/channel-related feature of vehicles from source environments and then to verify their identities. During the movement of vehicles, a blockchain module is proposed to guide the new environment to inherit the most optimal authentication knowledge from the meta-learning knowledge base and achieve high performance even with limited data. The BAML scheme is designed for reliable collaboration and continuous protections in IoV. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of BAML. When given 9 samples, the BAML of new environments reaches 99.7%, surpassing other competitive baselines."

While Semantic Web technologies (SWTs) offer solutions for efficient and versatile data exchange, the majority of software in engineering lack interfaces based on these technologies. Previous research has explored approaches to abstract structured data from external sources as virtual knowledge graphs (VKGs). In this work, we propose an approach to create VKGs from data available via the APIs of engineering software, enabling the querying of engineering data through SWTs and thus facilitating standardized data exchange. We first mathematically introduce the components of APIs of object-oriented software, including classes, their hierarchical relationships, attributes, and instances. We then define formulas to derive the triples of the VKG representing the components, as well as resulting triples according to RDFS entailment rules. Finally, we define a procedure based on the aforementioned formulas, which enables querying the VKG using triple patterns. This provides access to the VKG representing the software-internal data without materialization, in line with the concept of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">virtual</i>. We provide a general implementation of the approach, supporting triple pattern and SPARQL queries, and a software-specific adaption for a particular engineering software. Using this, we demonstrate the capabilities of the approach through an industrial use case. The performance characteristics of the approach are evaluated by analyzing query execution times and scaling behavior across different query types and graph sizes, in comparison with equivalent materialized graphs."

Leveraging deep learning, the model captures complex nonlinear relationships in time-series interaction data. To address the limited interpretability of neural networks, internal attention maps are clustered to reveal how the model allocates focus across time, providing insights into the temporal dynamics of merging behaviors. The proposed approach is evaluated against established acceleration-prediction methods, including LSTM, GRU, and the intelligent driver model (IDM), and achieves consistently lower prediction error among the data-driven models. Furthermore, by comparing cluster-specific differences in speed and spacing, the analysis uncovers distinct merging behavior patterns and validates the model’s ability to differentiate merge strategies. The attention-based interpretation highlights critical interaction moments that reflect driver decision processes during merging. Overall, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively combines predictive performance with interpretable behavior analysis for traffic interactions in highway merge zones."

Additionally, it dynamically adjusts power distribution to provide over-temperature protection, mitigating the risk of thermal runaway. Our feasibility analysis establishes the conditions under which the CBF-based safety constraints are satisfied, ensuring the existence of feasible control actions. Furthermore, we define comprehensive performance metrics to evaluate and compare the controller’s effectiveness. This includes CBF gain tuning based on feasibility results.

To address this, we propose the Cross-Scale Transformer Network (CSTNet), a novel deep learning architecture that dynamically captures and fuses multi-scale temporal and spectral features. The CSTNet introduces two key components: the Multi scale Time-Frequency Aggregation (MF-TFA) module for adaptive local feature representation across resolutions, and Feature Cross Transformer Block (FCTB), which enables explicit cross scale interaction through a global channel-wise cross-attention mechanism. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms five compared state-of-the-art methods, achieving overall accuracy scores of 87.3%, 90.5%, and 77.4% on the ADC 2004, MIREX 05, and MEDLEY DB datasets, respectively. Visualization results demonstrate that CSTNet effectively reduces octave errors."

    "abstract": "Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a potent tool for intelligent resource management in vehicular edge computing (VEC), and it marks a pivotal advancement in VEC via real-time physical entity mapping and state perception. However, due to the complex nature of dynamic state synchronization and multi-dimensional resource coupling in VEC, few existing studies have considered DT deviation and its impacts on network energy consumption and secure transmission. To address these issues, this paper first formulates a collaborative optimization problem integrating DT and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), where GenAI is embedded in the DT model for real-time deviation calibration, and combined with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) achieves efficient co-channel interference suppression; meanwhile, the computation model covers local, cache and multi-step offloading scenarios while deriving latency and energy consumption expressions with security overhead considered. Then, an improved marine predators algorithm (IMPA) is proposed to solve the above mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), which introduces a competitive update mechanism to dynamically balance global exploration and local exploitation via real-time fitness feedback. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed IMPA can converge with low complexity, and compared with existing algorithms, it achieves 83.3% improvement in total energy consumption reduction and 75.3% enhancement in latency stability."

The strategy comprises an outer voltage regulation loop implemented with an enhanced LADRC and an inner current tracking loop driven by a proportional-integral (PI) controller. Specifically, the traditional LADRC is enhanced via an improved linear extended state observer, which achieves separate compensation for low-order and high-order disturbances. Additionally, the observer parameters are optimized in real time based on the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. Finally, simulations and experiments under multiple operating conditions are conducted to validate the proposed control strategy, demonstrating its superior performance over double closed-loop PI control and traditional LADRC."

    "abstract": "Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely applied in prosthetic control, rehabilitation training, and human-machine interaction. This places stringent requirements on gesture recognition algorithms to balance long-range temporal modeling with local pose invariance. Existing approaches typically trade off between local and global features and lack causally consistent interpretability, resulting in insufficient generalization across subjects and sessions. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel dual-stream causal Capsule-Transformer network (CapsFormer). In the Transformer stream, we employ a “causal attention” in the self-attention mechanism to explicitly block all future information, ensuring that each time-step representation depends solely on itself and prior signals; in the Capsule stream, we leverage dynamic routing to capture local part-whole pose vectors, enhancing robustness against electrode shifts and muscle deformations. The two streams' features are then integrated in a fusion module and trained end-to-end. To validate the model's effectiveness, we evaluate it on a multi-subject dataset; results demonstrate that CapsFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models in recognition accuracy, cross-subject robustness, and interpretability. This work not only offers a new paradigm for efficient EMG signal representation but also supports causally consistent temporal signal analysis and interpretable deep learning methods, bearing significant implications for intelligent prosthetic control and human-machine interfaces."

We present AirSpy, a permission-lean application-layer side channel that combines (i) VR hand-tracking joint pose with unit-quaternion rotations and (ii) lightweight per-frame PAL counters (e.g., draw calls and frame timing). Our key insight is that each keystroke induces short, repeatable PAL spikes/dips that align in time with subtle quaternion dynamics of the pinching hand. Based on this complementarity, we build a two-stage pipeline: a PAL-driven segmentation module anchors candidate keypress windows, followed by attribution-guided feature selection and a lightweight Transformer–DNN decoder for key inference. We implement AirSpy on Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3 and evaluate it with 10 participants on a 29-key virtual keyboard (55k labeled frames). In foreground mode, AirSpy reaches 93.56% Top-1 accuracy with 92.8% segmentation recall; under background throttling, accuracy remains about 90.1%. Cross-device transfer between Quest 2 and Quest 3 maintains about 85–86% accuracy. The runtime overhead is small (about 11–13 ms added latency with under 3 FPS impact). Finally, we quantify practical mitigations, including API rate limiting and PAL counter sanitization, and summarize security–utility trade-offs to help platform designers better balance responsiveness and privacy."

    "abstract": "A capable and cost-effective protection scheme is essential for the reliable operation of a microgrid. Conventional impedance measurement-based protection is hindered by shorter line lengths, lower line reactance-to-resistance ratios, and fault ride-through (FRT) of inverter-interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) in microgrids. They are prone to malfunction due to the remote end infeed current during non-metallic faults. This paper addresses this challenge through the coordination of control and protection. IIDGs are configured to actively inject a small harmonic voltage component into the microgrid after fault while coping with FRT requirements using a dual-frequency controller. A hybrid injection activation criterion is embedded to ensure coordinated harmonic injection and equal participation from all IIDGs. Consequently, a uniform harmonic-frequency voltage potential can be generated throughout the microgrid, and its impact on IIDGs' FRT is minimized. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is verified on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental platform, and its enhancement to protection performance is validated through theoretical and simulation studies. It is revealed that the proposed control scheme can significantly reduce the fault location error and facilitate the application of single-ended impedance measurement-based protection in microgrids."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading global cause of death, but their accurate diagnosis remains challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in assisting disease diagnosis in general, their adoption in cardiology is hindered by three critical limitations: hallucination, inadequate domain-specific reasoning, and restricted knowledge coverage. To overcome these barriers, we developed Cardiology-Chat, an LLM-based system specifically tailored for cardiology. The system employs a three-step main reasoning framework: (1) parsing user queries with Llama 3.1 8B-instruct to extract key clinical information, (2) retrieving evidence from the knowledge base via Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (3) generating diagnostic conclusions using the fine-tuned Llama model. Two critical components have been developed to support the system's functionality. The first is a specialized cardiovascular vector knowledge base, constructed from multiple data sources to enhance the RAG subsystem. The second is a Chain-of-Thought–augmented dataset designed to strengthen the LLM’s in-depth reasoning capabilities. In addition, multiple LLMs were adopted to mitigate the possible \"self-consistency\" bias. Experiments on public cardiology QA and real clinical cases demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving 0.796 accuracy and 0.807 F1 respectively."

In traffic scenarios, existing object detectors often exhibit low recall rates when processing distant targets. Furthermore, the inherent depth ambiguity of monocular vision limits its application in three-dimensional spatial perception tasks. To address these issues, this paper proposes a collaborative perception framework that integrates improved YOLO11 detection (YOLO-DM) with depth estimation. The YOLO-DM network builds upon YOLO11 by introducing a novel C2PSA-MSDA module to expand the receptive field and enhance object features, while integrating a Dynamic Detection Head (DyHead) to improve scale robustness. Furthermore, the YOLO-DM network is combined with the PSMNet stereo matching network to achieve efficient acquisition of target depth information. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates that compared to the baseline, YOLO-DM improves mAP@0.5 by 2.2% and mAP@[0.5:0.95] by 2.7%, while reducing computational complexity and parameter count by 4.9% and 6.7%, respectively. The proposed framework significantly enhances perception accuracy while maintaining high model efficiency, offering a highly promising perception solution for autonomous driving systems."

Its core innovations lie in introducing a gradient descent iterative algorithm to realize adaptive correction of key spatial variables of the array, and proposing an adaptive regional optimization strategy. By partitioning the array aperture into functional regions (core region/transition region), this strategy achieves dynamic balance between directional response accuracy and periodic structure stability. Finally, high-precision conformal array apertures are generated through harmonic superposition and binarization processing.To verify the method’s effectiveness, three groups of control arrays (11×11 planar array, direct-projection curved-surface array, and SVL-optimized curved-surface array) were constructed using rectangular patch FSS elements, with full-wave simulations conducted in HFSS. Results demonstrate that the paraboloidal conformal array optimized by the SVL algorithm can stably maintain resonant characteristics around 12 GHz, whereas the traditional direct projection method leads to a complete disappearance of resonant points, fully validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Feature similarity is quantified via cosine similarity, which better aligns with the angular relationships in high-dimensional feature spaces compared to Euclidean metrics. Second, a joint association cost matrix is constructed by integrating motion information (IoU distance derived from Kalman-filtered trajectory predictions) with appearance information enabling high-precision detection-to-trajectory matching through a two-stage Hungarian algorithm framework. To address dynamic occlusion and posture variations, the appearance template library is incrementally updated, with adaptive updates triggered by significant posture changes. Experimental results on the MOT16 benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a state-of-theart MOTA score of 67.9%, significantly outperforming conventional methods and validating the efficacy of the joint appearance-motion strategy in enhancing tracking stability and accuracy under occlusion conditions. This work advances occlusion-robust MOT by integrating multi-branch feature learning with motion-aware appearance fusion, offering a scalable solution for real-world applications like intelligent surveillance and autonomous driving where dense occlusions are prevalent, and provides new insights into synergistic design of feature extraction and association mechanisms for conferencerelated technical fields (e.g., computer vision, intelligent transportation)."

    "abstract": "Increased electric vehicle adoption has expanded the number of unique fast charging profiles, further complicating infrastructure planning. In this study we characterize heterogeneity in real-world electric vehicle (EV) fast charging profiles across different vehicle models to identify key factors and to suggest implications for future profile design. We create a dataset from publicly available information then build a queuing model to understand throughput and electricity demand on high travel days. We quantify uncertainty in the number of EVs that can move through a charging station by comparing a Monte Carlo simulation to the deterministic throughput of a single repeated fast charging profile for each vehicle charged. Our findings show heterogeneity is significant for a 12 hour charging window, varying from 14 to 57 vehicles. Modeling diverse profiles or ensuring proper representation of the EV population should be considered when modeling infrastructure."

After whitening, a joint diagonalization procedure is employed to estimate the separation matrix, which is subsequently applied to all range cells to recover the target and jamming components. The proposed method maintains robust separation performance even under increased signal correlation or when the directions of arrival of the target and interference are closely spaced.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a State-of-Charge (SOC)-aware virtual inertia control strategy for grid-forming modular multilevel converters (GFM-MMCs) serving a receiving-end weak AC grid. Unlike typical micro-grid applications, the receiving-end MMC acts as the main supporter for the weak grid, where abrupt support loss due to battery depletion can trigger severe system-level instability. The link connects a sending-end PV-based islanded AC system to a receiving-end weak AC grid. A battery energy storage system (BESS) is interfaced with the DC link via an MMC-based DC/DC converter. To address the conflict between frequency support and energy constraints, an adaptive control scheme featuring a trapezoidal SOC-inertia profile is proposed. This mechanism maintains maximum virtual inertia within a nominal SOC range while dynamically decreasing the inertia coefficient as the SOC approaches its critical limits. Furthermore, a hard-constraint SOC protection scheme is implemented to prevent battery over-depletion. Time-domain simulations under diverse SOC conditions verify that the proposed strategy sustains the frequency support capability of conventional fixed-inertia designs, while effectively mitigating SOC depletion and preventing the violation of critical SOC constraints."

    "abstract": "In recent years, China's provincial power grids have entered a phase of high-proportion renewable energy penetration. Traditional weekly unit commitment models, lacking scenario adaptability and insufficient modeling refinement, often fail to balance renewable energy's periodic and cumulative fluctuations with multi-resource long-time-horizon coordinated dispatching requirements. This leads to unit operation inefficiencies and inadequate renewable energy consumption. To address this issue, this paper proposes a weekly refined unit commitment optimization method tailored for provincial power systems with high-proportion renewable energy. Targeting renewable energy's high installed capacity and generation volume, the method integrates electricity spot market clearing rules, refines modeling time granularity to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 5}$</tex> minutes to capture short-term output fluctuations of renewable energy, and covers wind, photovoltaic, hydropower, thermal power, and energy storage, achieving comprehensive optimization of unit start-ups and shut-downs states and output levels all week. A case study was conducted on a representative Chinese provincial power grid, where both renewable energy capacity and generation share rank top nationwide. Results show the proposed model not only reduces intra-day unit start-ups and shut-downs frequency, boosts power grid periodic reserve adjustment margin, and cuts windphotovoltaic curtailment, but also provides clear operational boundaries for day-ahead optimal scheduling. Ultimately, it offers reliable weekly operation support for power grid multi-time-scale coordinated dispatching."

Although scene graph-based methods can effectively model interactions between entities, most existing approaches overlook the rich semantic information embedded within scene graphs. Additionally, integrating large language models (LLMs) for semantic enhancement often suffers from hallucination problems, potentially introducing incorrect reasoning that misleads action recognition. To address these limitations, we propose SSGR-AR, a novel framework that structurally represents videos through scene graphs and constrain LLM reasoning using structured semantic paths derived from scene graph knowledge, ensuring controllable and reliable semantic enrichment. Moreover, we formulate entity alignment as a link prediction task and leverage a graph transformer to model the dynamic evolution of actions, thereby enhancing the model's capacity for long-term temporal reasoning. Experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of action recognition accuracy and generalization robustness."

However, this topology introduces critical challenges under the pole-to-pole faults (PPF), where the capacitive energy discharge of DC/DC converters generates a rapidly rising fault current, reaching extremely high peak amplitudes within microseconds, thereby severely jeopardizing the system reliability. To solve the problem, a protection scheme based on the line-mode fault component power (LFCP) is presented for DC collection line. Theoretical analysis reveals that during internal or external faults, the polarity of LFCP is different. Subsequently, a fault detection criterion leveraging the LFCP is established, and an associated protection strategy is developed. At last, extensive simulations validate that the LFCP based protection has simple algorithm, fast protection speed, and is less affected by the noise."

Traditional approaches often rely on binary interactions or low-order relationships, which fail to capture the higher-order dependencies among drugs, genes, and biological pathways. To address this limitation, we propose an Attention-enhanced Dual-Pathway Hypergraph Neural Network (ATDP-HGNN) that integrates drug molecular features and pathway gene expression data within a unified dual-hypergraph framework. The model constructs independent hypergraphs for drugs and pathways to encode multi-level associations and employs a dynamic attention mechanism to adaptively fuse drug-pathway interactions. Experimental results on two heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that ATDP-HGNN outperforms four representative baselines (iPaD, FacPad, GraphDPA, and MIDTI), achieving higher AUC and PRAUC values with improved robustness and interpretability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the hypergraph structure and attention mechanism contribute significantly to performance enhancement. These findings indicate that ATDP-HGNN provides an effective and interpretable approach for predicting potential drug-pathway associations, facilitating drug repositioning and systems pharmacology research."

The head is backbone-agnostic by design, requiring only per-point features and a residual/score output. We instantiate it on PD-LTS and add a minimal cross-backbone check showing gains on PD-Flow and IterativePFN. On PUNet, test EMD improves from 0.038 to 0.006 under matched training.

Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, which utilizes extremely wide bandwidth to achieve high-precision positioning, has attracted extensive attention under such circumstances. However, it also faces challenges such as measurement noise and accuracy degradation under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To address the aforementioned issues, in this article, a fusion positioning method based on Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) that integrates IMU and UWB through data fusion is proposed. This approach ultimately achieves high-precision positioning for UAVs in their operational environments. According to the simulation results, by adopting the factor graph optimization, the proposed sensor fusion algorithm can achieve the median positioning error, the 95th positioning error, the root mean square error (RMSE), and the average standard deviation for RMSE with 0.0356 m, 0.0733 m, 0.0433 m, and 0.0197 m in the focused environments."

The common approach partitions the image into uniform patches for distributed parallel computing. However, in the GPU inference cluster, it is difficult to maintain consistent computing capabilities across GPU nodes during inference. Assigning equal tasks can readily cause the Straggler Problem. To tackle this problem, we propose SplitFusion, a innovative framework incorporating two key components: Displaced Asymmetric Patch Parallelism and Resource-Aware Asymmetric Patch Partitioning. Displaced Asymmetric Patch Parallelism enables cross-patch semantic exchange through sliding observation windows and a fixed-size buffer, circumventing NCCL's uniform data size constraints. Resource-Aware Asymmetric Patch Partitioning predicts the computational capabilities of devices through short-term resource monitoring to guide the allocation of computational tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in scenarios with unequal idle resources across computational devices, our approach achieves more efficient utilization of computational resources compared to equal distribution strategies."

This paper analyzes the impact of the Low voltage ride-through (LVRT) threshold on active power output capability from three perspectives: the grid's resistance-to-reactance (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R} / \\mathrm{X}$</tex>) ratio, grid strength, and the probability distribution of voltage fault depth. The analysis reveals that for grids with a high R/X ratio, lowering the LVRT threshold yields a greater increase in active power output compared to grids with a low R/X ratio. In strong grids, lowering the LVRT threshold enhances active power output. For weak grids, lowering the LVRT threshold reduces active power capability during shallow faults but increases it during deep faults. Finally, simulation results verify the correctness of the analysis presented in this paper."

    "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to identify the factors affecting the intention to purchase electric motorbikes in Vietnam. The research subjects are customers who purchase motorbikes at stores. The sampling method used to collect data using non-probability convenience techniques. Data collection was done using an online survey tool called Google Form, which was linked by QR codes. The survey collected a total of 200 responses. This study used structural equation modeling (SEM). The study demonstrated the factors affecting the intention to purchase electric motorbikes: attitude, technology and subjective norms. In addition, the study demonstrated that environmental awareness has an impact on subjective norms and attitudes. At the same time, environmental awareness indirectly affects purchase intention through attitudes and subjective norms. Finally, the study did not find any impact of purchase cost on customers’ intention to purchase electric motorbikes. This study contributes to the literature for stakeholders to develop and propose appropriate policies to encourage consumers to switch from traditional motorbikes to electric vehicles in Vietnam’s green transportation."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problems of low accuracy and slow convergence speed of the traditional intelligent optimization problem in fault localization of distribution networks containing distributed power sources, a hierarchical fault localization method based on the improved dung beetle optimization algorithm is proposed. Firstly, An initial population with uniform distribution is generated using Tent chaotic mapping. After that, a combined mutation scheme and the sine-cosine algorithm are incorporated to boost local search efficiency and speed up convergence. Secondly, the distribution network model is simplified to locate the fault region using the improved dung beetle optimization algorithm, and the fault region is located twice using the exhaustive method. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is verified by experimentally analyzing single-point faults and multi-point faults."

    "abstract": "The V-model is a structured engineering framework used in the automotive and aeronautical industries. Each development phase, in this model, corresponds to a specific validation step. This study presents the first of its kind application of the V-model to the wind energy industry, covering the design, implementation, and validation of a direct power control algorithm with proportional-integral (DPC-PI) for a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The validation process proceeds through three rigorous stages: Model-in-the-Loop (MIL), Software-in-the-Loop (SIL), and Processor-in-the-Loop (PIL). Under a wind speed step from 6 m/s to 10 m/s, results show that DPC-PI reduces steady-state error by 83.7%, overshoot by 39.4%, and total harmonic distortion (THD) by 92% compared to classical DPC. Next to prove the adaptability of our control to the variations of the environment a conducted parameter variation test demonstrated stable operation and ripple suppression for both active and reactive power. Finally, an assessed operating mode test in sub-synchronous, synchronous, and super-synchronous regions show a reduction of up to 86.4% in power ripples and a THD below 0.9%. Under variable wind conditions, the controller holds THD at 0.84%, outperforming some of the recent methods. In the final phase, the PIL test was executed on the STM32F429 to reveal the real-time performance of this control."

    "abstract": "Self-balancing lower limb exoskeletons (SBLLE) hold the promise of helping individuals with diverse mobility impairments regain their ability to walk. Equipping exoskeletons with stable turning capabilities is crucial for their real-world application. This paper presents an effective control framework that enables stable turning motions in SBLLE without relying on external assistive devices. A turn-specific gait planner has been designed to generate stable reference gaits. Moreover, an adaptive variable impedance controller (AVIC) is introduced, which adjusts the center of mass (CoM) motion in real time to maintain balance during walking, even when carrying different patients. The proposed approach is validated through simulations, comparative studies, and multi-stage human-subject experiments with ten participants, ranging from healthy users to individuals with severe lower-limb motor impairment. Results consistently demonstrate stable turning performance, with the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) remaining within the support polygon during the entire walking process."

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts, such as points and boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter, the Parallel-Text Adapter, that injects text embeddings into SAM’s image encoder, enabling semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture frozen. Through supervised experiments and ablations on the low-data subsets of COCO and ADE20K as well as the COD10K dataset, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as additional inputs improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic conditioning into SAM’s architecture offers a practical, scalable path to efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity."

    "abstract": "Vibrations can reduce the controllability of vehicles and can be uncomfortable for passengers. In particular, nonlinear vibrations can lead to larger amplitudes and complex behaviors. Among these vibrations, chaotic vibrations are inherently unpredictable and may lead to instability, which is highly undesirable in practical applications. Although several control methods have been developed to eliminate chaotic vibrations in active suspension systems, they require a priori knowledge about vehicle systems. Thus, designing chaos controllers for practical scenarios can be very challenging. In this study, we propose a method based on machine learning to overcome this limitation. The deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is used to learn optimal control input to suppress chaotic vibrations. As a typical model of nonlinear motion, we considered a quarter-car model with jumping nonlinearity and trained a reinforcement learning model to suppress chaotic vibrations. The numerical results show that learned policies were able to suppress chaotic vibration and reduce the overall level of vibration. The obtained policies were evaluated across a wide range of forcing frequencies and simulations with stochastic excitation noises. The results demonstrate that chaos control based on deep reinforcement learning was able to reduce vibrations and stabilize chaotic behavior effectively in this application."
