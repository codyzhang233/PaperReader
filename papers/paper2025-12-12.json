Addressing the difficulties in constructing effective search directions and the tendency to fall into local optimal solutions for this type of problem, this paper proposes a adaptive space decomposition and directional sampling algorithm(ASDSEA) for large-scale disassembly line balancing problem. The algorithm adaptively generates direction vectors for objective space partitioning by evaluating the distribution characteristics of populations in the objective space, and generates new solutions through convergence and diverse direction sampling, improving the quality of solutions through an efficient offspring strategy. The proposed algorithm is compared with four frontier algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority."

    "abstract": "Reduction of the energy consumption of wireless sensor nodes is key for the successful deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications. This paper investigates the trade-off between energy and information freshness from the perspective of the transmission module of IoT sensor nodes which can alternate between Sleep (or Low-power) and Active modes of operation. In particular, timer-based sleep-wake scheduling is investigated for a single sensor node. A variation of Age of Incorrect Information (AoII), which is termed as AoII+ in the literature, is used as the performance metric for information freshness. Then, we provide closed-form expressions for both average AoII+ and average power when updates take place according to a Poisson process and service times are either deterministic or phase-type distributed. Subsequently, we propose two optimal schedulers, namely AoII-Idling Scheduler (AoII-IS) and AoII-Zero Idling Scheduler (AoII-ZIS), which are devised to control the transitions between the Sleep and Active modes while the average AoII+ is kept below a pre-defined threshold. Moreover, we propose an adaptive version of both schedulers which dynamically tune their timer parameter when the update rate is allowed to vary in time. We validate our analysis and findings with simulations."

    "abstract": "Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks aim to support innovative Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications that demand faster and more secure data transmission. While higher Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers employ measures like encryption and secure protocols to address data security, Physical-Layer Security (PLS) focuses on preventing information leakage to EavesDroppers (EDs) and mitigating the effects of jammers and spoofing attacks. In this context, the emerging technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can play an instrumental role, enhancing PLS by intelligently reflecting electromagnetic waves to benefit Legitimate Users (LUs) while obstructing EDs. This paper presents practical indoor measurements to evaluate the capability of an RIS to enhance PLS, focusing on a varactor-based RIS technology designed for the FR1 band at 3.55 GHz. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art RIS-aided secrecy optimization algorithms together with a novel approach designed in this paper, which relies on a newly generated RIS phase configuration codebook, highlight the potential of RISs to improve both data rates for LUs as well as secrecy against EDs in real-world indoor multipath environments. The results also demonstrate the frequency selectivity of the RIS, providing practical insights on the optimization of the technology."

    "abstract": "As the construction of offshore wind farms in China moves towards the large-scale development stage, the technological system of offshore wind power generation continues to improve. However, the strong volatility and randomness of offshore wind power output pose severe challenges to the stable operation of the power grid. In particular, the accurate prediction of wind power under extreme weather conditions has become a critical issue that needs to be addressed urgently. This paper proposes an innovative prediction method that integrates small-sample data expansion technology and the stochastic configuration network (SCN). The core meteorological factors under multi-season transitional weather are obtained through feature screening. Then the generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to effectively expand the small-sample data, and the complex mapping relationship between meteorological factors and wind power is deeply explored. Meanwhile, based on the integrated learning technique of the adaptive boosting (Adaboost) algorithm, multiple SCN models are weighted and integrally optimized. Finally, the pre-processed data are input into the SCN-Adaboost model for training and prediction analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the prediction accuracy of offshore wind power under extreme weather scenarios, providing strong technical support for ensuring the stable operation of the power grid."

However, in typical Cyber Physical Social Systems scenarios such as urban transportation and service robotics, physical sensing alone is not sufficient to capture shifts in public attention, emotional changes, and the evolution of public opinion. This paper proposes a Social Radar Doppler perception framework designed for embedded systems. By drawing an analogy with the classical Doppler effect in radar systems, the framework establishes a quantifiable model for the speed, direction, and dynamic features of social emotions and topics. In addition, we introduce a closed-loop 6S embedded social radar perception architecture. This architecture includes modules for data acquisition, semantic integration, emotion tracking, and strategy feedback. This framework can be broadly applied to support early decision-making in socially intelligent agents and provides a new perceptual dimension for future systems that deeply integrate humans, machines, and society."

To validate its effectiveness, we collect and annotate a novel PPC (Parallel Point cloud) dataset spanning diverse scenarios, trained a 3D object detection model, and deployed it on an onboard platform. Additionally, we propose an dynamic RoI adjustment mechanism for active 3D perception, leveraging detection results from both ego-vehicle and surrounding vehicles for iterative optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that parallel LiDARs significantly enhance sensor resource utilization efficiency, providing high-quality data for downstream perception tasks."

As electrical connectors are an integral component of commercial electronics, as well as the widespread shift toward lead-free electronics due to the hazardous effects of lead, understanding the mechanical properties of these connectors is essential. Of particular interest is the extraction forces which serve to maintain the integrity of electrical contacts. Despite extensive research on aging effects, limited work has been conducted as to its effects on extraction forces in lead-free electrical connectors.The goal of this work is to develop a better understanding of the effects of extended aging on the extraction forces of Sn-coated electrical connectors. Extraction (de-mating) force testing of multiple aged sample sets were performed to assess age dependent differences in extraction forces. To simulate long-term aging, samples were subjected to accelerated aging in a high-temperature oven for varying durations. Profilometry measurements were also made of the blade contacting surfaces and the results discussed in conjunction with the observed extraction force results."

    "abstract": "The growing prevalence of computationally intensive applications such as autonomous driving and in-vehicle infotainment places a substantial energy burden on modern vehicles. To mitigate this challenge, computational offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has attracted increasing attention. However, existing offloading solutions for VEC often face limitations in practicality, slow convergence, or unsatisfactory optimization quality. To overcome these challenges, this paper designs Variational Autoencoder Enhanced Lévy Differential Evolution Offloader (VELO), an optimization framework for task offloading in VEC environments. VELO dynamically selects between roadside units (RSUs) and cloud servers as offloading targets, aiming to reduce system energy consumption. The framework incorporates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for dimensionality reduction to accelerate inference and integrates a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm augmented with a Lévy flight strategy to improve optimization quality. Experimental results show that VELO achieves competitive results, effectively lowering system-level energy consumption while preserving rapid convergence. VELO offers a promising solution to reduce the computational load on next-generation vehicle applications and supports the development of energy-efficient, low-carbon intelligent transportation systems."

    "abstract": "Zero-shot industrial fault diagnosis leverages fault semantics to identify unseen fault categories that lack training data. However, existing approaches overlook the dynamic nature of industrial systems and the fact that fault data are inherently time seires. They typically define only non-temporal fault semantics, such as fault location and property, resulting in a transfer gap between semantic knowledge and time seires data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Temporal Semantic Diffusion Learning, which defines temporal semantics for the first time and analyzes them in a diffusion learning paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a new method for defining and representing temporal semantics, which automatically partitions fault time-series data into distinct evolutionary phases and collaborates with domain experts to describe the temporal characteristics of each phase. Next, we design a diffusion model conditioned primarily on the newly defined temporal semantics, complemented by traditional non-temporal semantics, to generate reliable samples of unseen faults, thereby enabling zero-shot diagnosis. Experiments conducted on a challenging real-world thermal power plant dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "This article introduces a novel interdisciplinary framework linking extended tunnelling in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes with false memory formation in neural systems. We analyze the quantum dynamics of excitonic transport, highlighting how vibronically assisted, non-local pathways can generate transient “false” energy channel deviations from canonical routes that emerge under specific system-bath interactions. While typically suppressed by decoherence, these channels may persist, reflecting intrinsic inefficiencies akin to tunnelling leakage. Drawing a conceptual parallel, we examine how maladaptive synaptogenesis and neural redundancy in cognitive systems may analogously produce false memories not from sensory errors, but from failures in distinguishing overlapping spatiotemporal patterns. These failures mirror quantum tunnelling anomalies and can be quantified as network-level susceptibility rates. We propose a unified model grounded in probabilistic network dynamics, suggesting that quantum-inspired false channel formation offers a metaphor and possibly a computational framework for understanding memory distortion. Extending this to cybersecurity, we argue that such cognitive vulnerabilities can be exploited through strategic information priming, forming the basis for advanced social engineering tactics. By bridging quantum biology, neuroscience, and cybersecurity, this work provides a theoretical synthesis with practical implications, offering new pathways for detecting deception, mitigating cognitive attacks, and informing resilient, bio-inspired AI design."

    "abstract": "One of the critical areas of implementation of technology in medical imaging is about obtaining datasets for training diagnostic models. This study discusses the potential of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) to generate synthetic brain tumor MRI images. The proposed method highlights the capacity of DCGAN to utilize a collection of brain tumor MRI images and generate highresolution grayscale images that mimic the patterns and features of real MRI scans. The DCGAN structure is made up of two rivaling neural networks, and they include the discriminator network and the generator network. The generator employs transposed convolutions subsequent to the dense layers in order to transform random noise vectors into realistic MRI images. This upsamples the feature maps to a target resolution of $128 \\times 128$ pixels. The discriminator is a convolutional neural network that performs the task of differentiation between real and fake images and therefore evaluates the veracity of the generated images. It is trained on a noise dimension of 100 and batch size of 4, for 10 epochs with 3750 steps per epoch. During training, the generator had been successful in producing MRI images that were visually realistic and assessed by the overlap of real and generated image distributions. This work indicates the ability of DCGANs to tackle the unavailability of medical imaging data through synthetically augmenting the datasets, which will then allow for the development of more robust diagnostic systems. Future research can hence strive to enhance image diversity and fidelity and work on adding these synthetic datasets into downstream tasks such as tumor segmentation and classification."

If their fingers enter the inappropriate dissection site, they determine this by changes in tactile feedback due to interference with the ureter and other organs. Previously, we developed a system that combines an elastic string and flexible sheets to train residents to recognize the tactile sensation of the inappropriate dissection site. However, to enhance the efficiency of skill acquisition among residents, it is crucial to capture not only tactile feedback but also the behavior of the fingertips and the ureter during dissection and provide feedback to the surgeon. In this study, we aim to infer the force acted by the fingertips on the elastic string and the behavior of the string by utilizing the fact that the tension acted to both ends of the string changes when the string, which simulates the ureter, deforms, even when the string is sandwiched between the sheets. As a result, the applicability of this method to quantitative measurement of the surgeon’s maneuvers was suggested."

To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited computational resources. We achieve a 10% increase in classification accuracy as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M FLOPs) at IoT device."

Dropout rates pose significant challenges in education systems globally, impacting students, communities, and societies. This paper emphasizes the necessity of proactive measures to address dropout rates and support student achievement by building an educational network. Through proactive approaches, schools can identify and address risk factors early, preventing student disengagement and dropout. Various strategies such as early interventions, personalized support systems, academic enrichment programs, and community partnerships are examined [4] for their efficacy in promoting student engagement and retention. Additionally, the role of data-driven decision-making and predictive analytics in identifying at-risk students and tailoring interventions is explored [1], [2]. Implementing proactive dropout mitigation requires collaboration among educators, administrators, families, and community stakeholders. Prioritizing proactive measures can foster a supportive learning environment, empowering students to excel academically. This paper highlights the significance of proactive dropout mitigation that has been enabled using a seemingly enhanced automated full-stack student management system integrated with ML algorithms used in enhancing student success and promoting educational equity.

However, the rapid expansion of terrestrial and satellite communication networks has introduced significant interference challenges, particularly in frequency bands that overlap with or are adjacent to EESS sensors. In this work, we develop a system model that explicitly characterizes EESS interference by considering reflected signal effects and spatial interference accumulation. Based on this model, we propose a EESS-aware resource allocation (EARA) framework that jointly optimizes power allocation and user association, while ensuring that interference to EESS sensors remains within acceptable limits. A non-convex joint optimization problem is formulated and efficiently solved leveraging the Lagrangian dual transform and Dinkelbach’s method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EARA scheme achieves up to 26.3% higher sum rate compared to genetic algorithm and binary whale optimization algorithm, while strictly satisfying the ITU-defined interference threshold.

    "abstract": "Design of advanced modulations needs to be revisited to cater for the diverse requirements of future 6th Generation (6G). While most existing modulation schemes operate coherently and need pronounced channel-tracking pilots to reach performance limits, noncoherent transmission offers a viable option by avoiding channel estimation. Noting that the noncoherent capacity-achieving input symbols are good sphere packing over Grassmannian field and each symbol is a subspace in Euclidean space, additional information can be embedded by further packing over the subspaces. In this paper, we propose a hybrid high-dimensional modulation scheme that bears both noncoherent and coherent components via multi-branch mapping. The packing problem is formulated into optimizing rotational angles of noncoherent codewords whose closed-form expressions are derived in this paper. A two-stage binary labeling as well as integration method with waveform are proposed to extend performance limits. Correspondingly, a channel-adjustable receiver is proposed to recover the noncoherent and coherent components sequentially. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method yields Grassmannian most 2.4dB gain compared with pilot-based scheme under suitable coding pair of two branches."

In this manner, we consider a high-altitude platform station (HAPS)-assisted bidirectional relaying system operating with hybrid terahertz (THz)/free-space optical (FSO) links in a multi-satellite and multi-ground station communication scenario. Unlike conventional setups, both the satellite and ground station nodes are dynamically selected, and bidirectional relaying is employed to enhance spectral efficiency. Realistic physical impairments, such as beam divergence and misalignment are incorporated into the system model, and system outage probability expression is derived to evaluate the overall performance under various configurations. The results show that the hybrid THz/FSO approach not only enhances reliability against pointing errors but also benefits significantly from multi-node diversity, making it a strong candidate for future reliable and high-capacity integrated non-terrestrial network architectures."

We present a hardware-in-the-loop transmission system utilizing newly developed prototypes of transmit and receive front ends operating in the frequency range from 150 to 170 GHz. The front ends’ analog beamforming architecture enables the generation of eight distinct beams with 6° separation in azimuth, thus creating a field of view with 48° one dimensional angular scanning range on either side of the link. The system implements dynamic beamforming based on the 5G New Radio (NR) waveform’s design principles for the initial access/beam acquisition procedure. Experimental performance assessments conducted in an indoor environment prove the system’s potential to support mobility and mitigate the effects of signal blockage. Specifically, when encountering a lineof-sight link blockage event, the system successfully transitioned to a reflected propagation path, incurring approximately 4dB of loss. Additionally, a mobile receiver could be tracked while maintaining a 1dB variation in the wireless link budget. These results demonstrate the feasibility of D-band adaptive beamforming."

Existing systems lack unified governance and efficient sharing mechanisms for AI capabilities, which severely constrains network operations efficiency. To address this problem, this paper proposes an AI capability recommendation method driven by comprehensive intent parsing. The method combines a Naive Bayes algorithm with TF-IDF to precisely classify and interpret user input intents. Building on this, and incorporating multi-dimensional value evaluation metrics (such as accuracy, error, and latency), the proposed system architecture enables intelligent recommendation, subscription, evaluation, retraining, and deployment of AI capabilities. This approach not only improves the accuracy of AI capability recommendations but also supports standardized reuse of capabilities and cross-system orchestration. The experimental results show that the average MAPE of the intended resolution of this method is controlled within 8 %, and the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$F 1$</tex> value during re evaluation after deployment usually increases to above 0.90. It also shows good performance in cold start scenarios, and the increase in algorithm complexity has a reasonable impact on latency. This proves that it has high recommendation efficiency and strong model adaptability in real-world scenarios, effectively supporting the development needs of intelligent telecommunications network management."

One application is the monitoring of livestock transport, a key focus of the Horizon Europe project COMMECT, which aims to develop a smart multi-connectivity solution to ensure seamless connectivity throughout the transport route. Although beneficial, predicting network KPIs based on radio KPIs is particularly challenging in dynamic environments due to the intricate nature of their relationship. In our previous study, this weak relationship led to limited performance in applying a supervised Random Forest (RF) model. Aiming to improve the prediction of network KPIs, we investigate the convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) time-series model, which combines convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction with LSTM layers to learn temporal dependencies. Unlike the supervised RF model, the current approach predicts network KPIs based on past information about the network KPI itself, bypassing the need for a mapping between radio and network KPIs. In our comparison, the CNN-LSTM time series and RF models have been trained and tested based on measured 5G throughput and latency data collected in northern Denmark. The CNN-LSTM model outperforms the RF model, achieving an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score improvement of 26.17% for latency and 15.81% for throughput, highlighting its ability to adapt to varying network conditions in a realistic setting."

To enhance robustness against noisy data, the proposed method adopts the Maximum Correntropy Criterion as a distance metric, effectively suppressing outlier influence. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm, grounded in Fenchel conjugate theory and block coordinate update techniques, is developed to solve the model, and theoretical guarantees of convergence are provided. Comprehensive experiments on seven real-world image datasets demonstrate that LAGFC outperforms twelve state-of-the-art clustering methods across diverse scenarios in most cases, validating its accuracy and robustness."

Traditional algorithms and prior Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods fail to meet LEO’s demands for managing extreme dynamics, massive scale, and multi-objective optimization. This paper introduces an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) framework for intelligent spectrum sharing and dynamic resource allocation in satellite-terrestrial down-link systems. First, we established a geometric model for satellite-terrestrial down-link communication, and accurately derived the statistical distribution function of satellites within the space enclosed by a specific orbital line by combining the stochastic geometry theory. Under this geometric model, a communication scenario was introduced, and an adaptive modulation transmission mechanism based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals was designed. Then, the system combines the real-time spectrum sensing results with the natural language description of the quality of service of multi-service data using prompt engineering techniques, and delivers the comprehensive information to the LLM for resource allocation and generation of a transmission scheme. Finally, the resource allocation and transmission scheme determined by the LLM is applied to the established communication model, and the system performance is comprehensively evaluated by analyzing indicators such as outage probability, system throughput, and transmission and waiting delays. Primary contributions include novel dynamic service-to-strategy generation, an LLM-centric prompt-driven architecture, and a new paradigm that positions the LLM as an intelligent “spectrum orchestration brain” for complex global LEO resource management. Collectively, these advancements enhance spectrum utilization intelligence, adaptability, and efficiency, offering a transformative approach to overcome the limitations of prior methods in demanding LEO environments."

    "abstract": "Digital Image Correlation (DIC) has become indispensable for non-contact strain measurement in civil and mechanical engineering, yet its accuracy critically depends on user-defined input parameters. While parameters like subset size are often standardized, the interpolation method—a rarely examined factor—significantly impacts strain field reliability. This work addresses this gap by proposing a novel comparative analysis of three interpolation algorithms (Bi-cubic, cubic, and spline) in 2D DIC, using speckled-image datasets from real experiments. Following iDICs guidelines for fixed parameters, strain fields were computed for all cases and compared visually and quantitatively. The results demonstrated that bi-cubic interpolation is the best choice for DIC surface inspection under dynamic loading, because it reduces errors in edges and high-strain areas. Spline interpolation provided inaccurate results in the edges of the sample which deviated by up to 12% from validated results, whereas cubic interpolation introduced deviations in distorted areas because of the missing data due to speckle distortion during tension of the sample. These results improve measurement quality in applications such as structural health monitoring by providing new useful suggestions for interpolation selection. By giving priority to bi-cubic interpolation, engineers can improve instrumentation best practices by reducing frequent DIC inaccuracies without spending additional computation costs."

In these scenarios, a chaser vehicle must determine the orientation and angular velocity of a target object using onboard sensors. This work addresses the challenge of designing an Equivariant Filter (EqF) that can reliably estimate both the relative attitude and the target angular velocity using noisy observations of two known, non-collinear vectors fixed in the target frame. To derive the EqF, a symmetry for the system is proposed and an equivariant lift onto the symmetry group is calculated. Observability and convergence properties are analyzed. Simulations demonstrate the filter's performance, with Monte Carlo runs yielding statistically significant results. The impact of low-rate measurements is also examined and a strategy to mitigate this effect is proposed. Experimental results, using fiducial markers and both conventional and event cameras for measurement acquisition, further validate the approach, confirming its effectiveness in a realistic setting."

    "abstract": "This article presents the design and functional validation of deep neural network-based approximators for the control policy of constrained model predictive control applied to a distributed energy resource unit operating in grid-supporting mode within an AC microgrid. The control scheme follows a conventional cascaded architecture, consisting of a zero-level control loop that regulates the DER output voltage, and a primary control loop responsible for balancing power supply and demand. Simulations show that the control policy approximated using neural networks achieves functional performance equivalent to a conventional implicit formulation of MPC. Moreover, the execution time of neural networks is expected to scale better to highdimensional optimization problems compared to conventional iterative solvers. Experimental validation was carried out on a lab-scale plant prototype with controllers executed on dSPACE MicroLabBox platform. To meet execution-time requirements for a target control interval of 200μs, the conventional implicit formulation requires simplifying the constraints, which restrict the maximum actuation voltage, and adopting a short prediction horizon. In contrast, the neural-network-based controller enables the use of more complex constraint sets and a longer prediction horizon, thereby maximizing the utilization of the variable inverter voltage."

    "abstract": "The growing data exchange among consumer-electronic (CE) devices demands encryption methods that balance security, efficiency, and real-time performance. Thus, we introduce a four-dimensional Dynamic Feedback Memristive Chaotic System (4D-DFMCS) and then propose a chaotic encryption method based on block-wise diffusion. Specifically, a 4D-DFMCS with enhanced chaotic properties is constructed by introducing the nonlinear properties of the memristor. It has a larger chaotic range and can improve chaotic dynamic degradation compared with traditional systems, thereby enhancing the security and stability of the encryption algorithm. Using this system for block data diffusion, a novel block-wise random diffusion mechanism is designed. By introducing global dependencies, this method significantly reduces the risk of system deciphering due to eavesdropping attacks. This further enhances the protection of sensitive visual data on CE devices against diverse attacks. In addition, the pre-sharing defects of initial value are prevalent in existing chaotic cryptographic systems, so a novel initial key generation and dynamic update mechanism based on Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) protocol is developed. Finally, the result shows that the key space reaches 4.26×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">178</sup>. The Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI) values are obtained as 99.6056% and 33.4333%. It further demonstrates the scheme’s robustness against eavesdropping under SNR constraints, with decrypted outputs appearing noise-like below 15 dB. These results demonstrate the strong security performance of the proposed scheme in CE applications requiring both high confidentiality and real-time processing."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection plays a crucial part in monitoring the evolution of land cover. Despite remarkable progress in recent years, existing change detection models still struggle with two major challenges that lead to inaccurate change predictions. For one, current models lack sufficient global relation modeling, resulting in coarse boundary prediction and false identification of unwanted variations. For another, bitemporal images often display divergent imaging styles due to lighting, sensor, or seasonal differences, and this cross-temporal style inconsistency would amplify the pseudo-changes caused by non-semantic variations. In this paper, we present the style-alignment and appearance-relation modeling change detection model (STAR-CD) to tackle the above challenges. First, we propose an appearance-relation modeling block (ARMB) to jointly explore semantic differences from both local textures and global structures of remote sensing images, effectively reducing false alarms and refining change boundary predictions. Second, we design a Fourier-inspired style alignment module (FSAM), which suppresses style-induced noise and reveals true changes by texture-style decoupling in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on the WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD, and CDD datasets demonstrate the superiority of our STAR-CD over state-of-the-art methods. In particular, STAR-CD surpasses previous methods by 2.40% and 4.34% in F1 and IoU on the CDD datasets, respectively. Visual comparisons further validate its strength in predicting precise change boundaries and robustly suppressing pseudo-changes."

Manipulator must handle potential hazards such as joint profile oscillations or whole-arm collisions within feasible motion ranges. This article addresses discontinuous joint velocities during obstacle avoidance and resolves redundancy resolution across multiple tasks. To mitigate discontinuous joint velocities caused by switching between the closest link-obstacle pairs, a method is introduced that linearly combines obstacle avoidance behaviors across all link-obstacle pairs to generate smooth avoidance motions. Furthermore, a differential inverse kinematic method is proposed that simultaneously handles multiple Cartesian-space and joint-space equality tasks. This algorithm autonomously scales within joint limits to identify feasible solutions. The proposed approach was validated through simulations and experiments with the 7-DoF Franka Emika Panda manipulator in both dynamic and static environments.

This study proposes an edge artificial intelligence–based sitting posture recognition system that combines infrared wide-angle cameras with a lightweight YOLOv11 model optimized for embedded deployment. A position calibration mechanism was developed to ensure robustness across diverse body types and office chair designs. The system can accurately classify 18 sitting postures and maintain high recognition performance even under occlusion conditions, such as when users wear long skirts. To address the challenges of latency and energy efficiency in edge AI deployment, the model was implemented on a TB-RK3399ProX embedded board using its neural processing unit for real-time inference. Experimental results demonstrated an accuracy of 93.15% and an inference delay of 8.73 ms, confirming the system’s stability and responsiveness in various seating environments. Compared with traditional wearable or pressure-sensor-based systems, the proposed noncontact solution offers superior comfort, efficiency, and deployment feasibility for practical posture monitoring."

    "abstract": "Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable, machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format, and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS 23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO). We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset. We create \"functional location tags\" as OWL individuals that become instances of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards. Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart Standards."

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for identifying and analyzing algebraic vulnerabilities in contemporary AI architectures through computational algebra and discrete mathematics. We demonstrate that the composition of linear transformations, non-linear activation functions, and attention mechanisms creates exploitable polynomial systems that can be systematically analyzed using advanced algebraic techniques. Our methodology reveals fundamental weaknesses in popular architectures including Vision Transformers (ViTs), BERT-based models, and Residual Networks (ResNets), showing how adversaries can construct attacks that exploit polynomial-time algorithms while acknowledging current computational limitations. Through rigorous mathematical analysis and experimental validation on networks up to 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup> parameters, we establish theoretical bounds for these vulnerabilities and demonstrate attack success rates of 52-78% on individual network components. We provide detailed end-to-end attack demonstrations showing measurable prediction changes, with attack success defined as achieving targeted modifications in network outputs that exceed 10% deviation from original predictions. While computational scalability remains a significant constraint, the findings suggest that algebraic structure analysis provides crucial insights into AI system security that require consideration from both cryptographic and machine learning communities. We position this work as contributing to both mathematical interpretability of neural networks and security vulnerability analysis, with implications for developing algebraically-robust architectures."

The proposed method offers several key advantages: 1) it maintains a simple PI structure while incorporating nonlinear elements; 2) unlike traditional PI control, which typically employs fixed PI gains and is susceptible to integration saturation, this approach utilizes self-tuning PI gains to effectively eliminate saturation issues, thereby addressing the long-standing windup problem; and 3)it skillfully manages both the transient behavior and steady-state accuracy of the tracking error through a new prescribed performance function that is independent of initial conditions. This ensures that, for any unknown bounded initial tracking errors, the proposed PI-like control can uniformly confine the tracking error to a specified boundary (accuracy) within a predetermined time rather than over an infinite duration. The effectiveness and advantages of this method are validated through simulation results."

    "abstract": "Machine learning has taken a critical role in seismic interpretation workflows, especially in fault delineation tasks. However, despite the recent proliferation of pretrained models and synthetic datasets, the field still lacks a systematic understanding of the generalizability limits of these models across seismic data representing a variety of geologic, acquisition and processing settings. Distributional shifts between different data sources, limitations in fine-tuning strategies and labeled data accessibility, and inconsistent evaluation protocols all represent major roadblocks in the deployment of reliable and robust models in real-world exploration settings. In this paper, we present the first large-scale benchmarking study explicitly designed to provide answers and guidelines for domain shift strategies in seismic interpretation. Our benchmark encompasses over 200 combinations of model architectures, datasets and training strategies, across three diverse datasets (synthetic and real data) including FaultSeg3D, CRACKS, and Thebe. We systematically assess pretraining, fine-tuning, and joint training strategies under varying degrees of domain shift. Our analysis highlights that commonly used fine-tuning practices can lead to catastrophic forgetting, especially when source and target datasets are distributionally disjoint, and that larger models such as Segformer tend to be more robust to adaptation than smaller architectures. Interestingly, we also find that common domain adaptation methods outperform fine-tuning when the distributional shift is large, yet underperform when source and target domains are similar. Finally, we complement conventional segmentation metrics with a novel analysis based on fault characteristic descriptors, revealing how models absorb structural biases from different training datasets. Overall, we establish a robust experimental baseline to provide insights into the tradeoffs inherent to current fault delineation workflows, and shed light on directions for developing more generalizable, interpretable and effective machine learning models for seismic interpretation. The insights and analyses reported provide a set of guidelines on the deployment of fault delineation models within seismic interpretation workflows."

Existing enhanced GFM control strategies are often designed for a specific disturbance scenario, requiring extended recovery times or exhibiting frequency fluctuations.

    "abstract": "Double patch clamp technique, using two micropipette electrodes to patch and measure electrophysiological signals of two neurons, is essential for investigating the functional connections between neurons in brain. However, the interactive mechanical disturbances from the dual-micropipette motions inside viscoelastic brain tissue cause dynamic drifts of neurons, making double patching low efficiency and challenging. In this paper, an interactive mechanical modeling of two micropipettes approaching two cells in elastic environment was established to estimate the dynamic drift of the cells. Based on that, a synchronous descent strategy, an appropriate relative position of two cells, and an online trajectory plan of two micropipettes were determined to improve double patch clamp efficiency. Finally, a robotic double patch clamp operation process was established for functional connectivity measurement between neurons in brain slice. The effectiveness of the proposed work is validated through both finite element modeling and experiments. The double patch clamp experiments on neurons in visual cortex demonstrate that our method achieves a 40% improvement in success rate and a 38% improvement in speed in comparison to the traditional manual method. With the above advantages, diverse functional connectivity activities between neurons were found using our system, paving a solid ground for further research."

While single-view prediction has advanced, it remains limited by the ego vehicle’s narrow field of view and incomplete scene understanding, resulting in inaccurate predictions in occluded or complex interactive scenarios. Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) cooperation addresses this by offering broader context through roadside sensing and communication. However, effectively leveraging such rich semantic context remains challenging. Existing trajectory prediction methods primarily rely on lightweight predictors that emphasize dynamic feasibility, yet often overlook semantic cues provided by V2I, leading to physically plausible but semantically invalid trajectories. Conversely, vision language models (VLMs) excel in high-level semantic reasoning but struggle with accurate numerical prediction. To leverage the complementary strengths of lightweight predictors and VLMs, we propose TrajAgents, a multi-agent framework integrating trajectory-level prediction and semantic-level reasoning via five specialized agents. Results on V2X-Seq-TFD demonstrate TrajAgents’ superiority in accuracy and semantics consistency."

To follow the reference speed, the control layer employs a hierarchical architecture: the upper-layer PID generates torque demands, while the lower-layer DMPC dynamically manages powertrain energy and optimizes energy consumption and engine operating points via sequential quadratic programming (SQP).

    "abstract": "Smart electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are crucial in advancing sustainable transportation by scheduling charging based on user preferences and grid constraints. However, their reliance on digital communication makes them vulnerable to attacks that can shift the EV aggregator’s load profile to different times, leading to substantial financial losses. They can also alter charging times in ways that degrade battery health and overburden the grid. Although the existing literature has explored various strategies to mitigate these risks, most prior work has focused on simple, handcrafted charge manipulation attacks (CMAs). This makes them often fall short when confronted with artificially intelligent methods to remain undetected. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that both generates and defends against highly evasive CMAs. First, we utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to craft advanced, stealthy attacks capable of bypassing intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we introduce an IDS built on LSTM variational autoencoders, which captures the nuanced temporal dependencies of smart CMAs, as well as intricate patterns. This enables our IDS to significantly enhance the detection and mitigation of complex threats. We conduct extensive simulations using real-world datasets, which reveal critical security gaps in existing benchmark approaches while highlighting the strong performance of our proposed framework. Notably, our IDS achieves detection accuracies of 0.97, 0.96, and 0.96 across different scenarios, even against highly evasive CMAs."

    "abstract": "We evaluated the impact of relay node placements on communication performance in an IoT mesh network using IEEE 802.11ah (Wi-Fi HaLow™) through real-world experiments. Specifically, we investigated how the location of relay nodes affects TCP and UDP communication. While previous research on mesh networks have mainly relied on simulations, focused on Wi-SUN using smart meter infrastructure, or conventional Wi-Fi systems, few evaluations have been conducted for actual Wi-Fi HaLow equipment. This study provides practical insights through experiments conducted in a real environment using devices that support MAP mode. The results showed that TCP performance decreased with distance, whereas UDP was less affected."

In a previous study, we developed a hybrid DC CB that utilizes a current-limiting fuse as the main path. Additionally, the commutation path incorporates a single IGBT and a contactor connected in series to suppress the voltage across the IGBT. However, its practical implementation faces challenges related to operational delay and speed. In this study, the limitations of using a typical contactor, a plate-plate contactor, is first verified. To address these challenges, two novel contactor designs is proposed: a hemisphere-plate contactor and a sliding contactor. These designs are expected to reduce the duration between the commutation and interruption, thereby providing a promising solution to ensure reliable fault current interruption in hybrid DC CBs."

By incorporating encryption, this constraint can be relaxed, enabling higher secure transmission rates while tolerating limited leakage. This paper investigates an encryption-aware power allocation strategy and achievable transmission rate of a Gaussian wiretap channel in the presence of multiple cooperative jammers. By analyzing the rate-equivocation region and the corresponding rate maximization problem, optimal cooperative jamming strategy that maximizes the encryption-aware secrecy capacity is first addressed. The encryption-aware rate maximization problem is then shown to be equivalent to a non-convex beamforming vector optimization under a non-linear constraint, which is explicitly solved. Our numerical results illustrate that by utilizing the prior knowledge of encryption, optimizing the power allocation among jamming nodes significantly enhances the achievable secrecy rates."

    "abstract": "In recent years, transfer learning-based dynamic constrained multi-objective optimization algorithms (TL-DCMOAs) have shown great promise in handling dynamic constrained multi-objective optimization problems (DCMOPs). In existing TL-DCMOAs, environmental similarity is typically assessed by measures based on Euclidean distance. However, such measures merely capture overall numerical differences between two environments, which are sensitive to local fluctuations in environmental information, potentially leading to misjudgments of environmental similarity. Besides, most existing TL-DCMOAs leverage historical constrained and unconstrained Pareto-optimal solutions as knowledge, but neglect relations and implicit solutions behind them for acquiring knowledge. To address the above issues, an environmental knowledge-driven transfer strategy with collaborative learning (EKTS-CL) is proposed in this article. Specifically, we design two structural similarity measures (SSMs) which consider the mean, variance, and covariance of environmental information, to comprehensively assess the environmental structural discrepancies with respect to concentration, divergence, and correlation, respectively. Using SSMs, the most structurally similar historical unconstrained Pareto-optimal solutions (UPS) and constrained Pareto-optimal solutions (CPS) can be obtained. Additionally, true CPS and UPS share partial solutions across all environments or the majority of environments of a DCMOP. From the obtained CPS and UPS that separately approximate the true CPS and UPS of the current environment, we extract implicit shared solutions and exclusive ones through collaborative learning, providing high-quality knowledge than the obtained plain solutions for knowledge transfer. Our experimental results include comprehensive comparisons with seven state-of-the-art DCMOAs, and show that the proposed EKTS-CL brings significant performance improvements in solving DCMOPs."

This dataset is generated through the two-source energy balance model coupled to soil moisture (TSEB-SM) and a novel reconstruction method (DNN-ETo) using deep neural networks and reference evapotranspiration. This dataset showed good agreement with ground measurements across various landcover types with a RMSE, bias, NSE and KGE of 1.02 mm day-1, -0.17 mm day-1, 0.51 and 0.73. Regarding spatial distributions and interannual variations, TSEB-SM ET exhibits similar performance to previous studies, while providing more reasonable values in the arid and semi-arid regions. The dataset has high potential in water resources management and climate change research. The TSEB-SM ET product is freely available at https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.301340."

On the other hand, the machine-learning-based methods could predict efficiently at the microsecond level. Thus, we propose three machine-learning-based methods for dynamic travel time prediction using XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. We conducted the evaluation experiment with a $4.6 \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{~km}^{2}$ area in Kyoto, Japan, and compared them with a commercial detailed route API. As a result, our proposed three methods succeed in predicting travel times with 10 ms which is two digits faster than API and the prediction error rate is between $-0.37 \\%$ and $+0.31 \\%$. Especially, the method using CatBoost obtains the fastest prediction speed of three digits faster than API."

Compared to QAOA, pVSQA can more efficiently solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we define the personalized course selection problem (PCSP), which involves finding the optimal combination of courses for a student, and then propose a method that integrates a postprocessing algorithm into pVSQA to effectively solve PCSP. Experimental results show that, compared to conventional QAOA, pVSQA significantly improves both the probability to obtain feasible solutions and the energy expectation among feasible solutions."

In order to mitigate the butterfly-like hysteresis with creep in dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), an adaptive piecewie implicite inverse finite-time control scheme is proposed in this paper. The implicit inverse indicates that this is not a direct inverse of the hysteresis, but an online decoupling algorithm to approximate the search for the actual control signal. A state observer is built to estimate the unmeasurable state of the system, and the radial basis function neural networks are utilized to approximate the unknown dynamical part of the system, which is combined with the dynamic surface technique so that the system does not have to do complex coordinate transformations. It is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobally finite-time stabilized (SGFTS). The effectiveness of the scheme is verified on the DEA actuated motion control platform."

    "abstract": "The phenomena of nature are still a great mystery to the scientific community, and we are sometimes surprised by uncertainties. Predicting lightning strikes is a critical need, especially in sectors such as mining, where workers are often exposed to open field conditions. To ensure the safety of these professionals, it is essential to use technologies that allow lightning to be accurately anticipated and effective alerts to be issued. This article highlights the importance of prediction systems that combine different technologies, such as weather radars, satellites, electric and magnetic field sensors, wind speed and relative humidity measurements, all in line with the NBR-16785 and IEC-62793 standards. The proposed methodology aims to optimize alert times, increasing safety and operational efficiency. The previous system, which relied mainly on weather radars, satellites and long-distance electromagnetic field measurements, was improved with the installation of point sensors that measure electric field, magnetic field, wind speed and relative humidity. This integration resulted in an average 80% reduction in the duration of alerts, providing significant gains in operation, maintenance and production in the mineral extraction and processing process. The model was implemented in several mines and evaluated during the full rainy season between 2024 and 2025, demonstrating its effectiveness in protecting workers and improving productivity. This innovative approach not only increases safety, but also contributes to the optimization of mining processes, showing that the combination of technologies can be the key to predicting and mitigating the risks associated with lightning strikes."

Based on simulation results, this paper systematically compares the effects of the least squares (LS), linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), radial basis function (RBF), and genetic algorithm-optimized RBF (GA-RBF) in both relay-free and relayed scenarios, assessing their effectiveness in low-speed and high-speed environments. The results show that the LMMSE and GA-RBF algorithms significantly outperform other methods under high SNR conditions and high-speed scenarios, highlighting their robustness to Doppler frequency shifts. These findings provide valuable insights for the optimization of channel estimation technology in VANETs, and also offer key trade-offs for algorithm selection and optimization in dynamic channel environments."

This paper proposes a multi-sensor SLAM system based on Radar-Inertial-Barometer integration, where the IMU optimizes relative elevation between frames, and the barometer provides altitude information to constrain absolute elevation, thereby improving pose estimation, especially in elevation, and effectively mitigating radar drift.

    "abstract": "Accurate angular speed estimation is critical for controlling mechanical and electromechanical systems. Linear Hall sensors are widely used for this purpose, but their signals are often distorted by magnet misalignment and manufacturing imperfections. These distortions introduce nonlinear effects that traditional filters and observers cannot handle effectively, leading to poor estimation performance. Conventional models often rely on compensation mechanisms to correct these distortions, but such strategies are limited and reflect the inability to fully capture the system's true behavior. This paper proposes a novel AI-powered strong observer using a single-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The method maps magnetic field measurements directly to angular speed, avoiding the need for compensation, explicit modeling, or prior knowledge of distortion characteristics. Trained on real-world data, the observer inherently captures nonlinearities and signal dynamics, providing robust and accurate estimation across a wide range of operating conditions. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed approach in AI-based control and estimation systems."

However, existing priority-aware sketches methods struggle to effectively handle the dynamic changes in flow priority distribution in realworld detection environments, leading to wasted or insufficient storage space. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new priority-aware sketch with Dynamic Memory Allocation called DMA-Sketch. It dynamically adjusts the detection framework based on flow priority distribution information and adaptively allocates appropriate memory space to each storage region.

This work proposes a semantic communication framework for video surveillance data transmission in remote areas. The framework transmits compact semantic representations from cameras over LEO satellites using Narrowband communication technology. More importantly, we formulate and solve a resource allocation problem that maximizes semantic information transmission under bandwidth constraints by optimally selecting semantic representations and satellite resource units.

    "abstract": "Deformable image registration plays a crucial role in image diagnosis, disease monitoring, and surgical navigation by establishing anatomical correspondences between moving and fixed images. Traditional methods typically require time-consuming iterative optimization processes, leading to high computational costs. Recently, deep learning techniques have gained significant attention in medical image registration, offering improved computational efficiency. However, these methods often rely on intensive computing and storage resources, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments. To address this issue, we propose CAAC-Net, a highly efficient network designed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining high registration accuracy. By introducing a dual-stream pyramid structure, CASA module, and CoConv module, we effectively reduce computational costs and improve registration performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CAAC-Net achieves the highest accuracy on the LPBA40 dataset, significantly reducing GPU memory usage while enhancing computational efficiency. These improvements make CAAC-Net well-suited for resource-constrained clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) is one of the promising techniques for 5G networks and beyond (6G), in which the same node/hardware is used to provide both backhaul and cellular services in a multi-hop architecture. Due to the sensitivity of the backhaul links with high rate/reliability demands, proper network planning is needed to ensure the IAB network performs with the desired performance levels. In this paper, we study the effect of infrastructure planning and optimization on the coverage of IAB networks. We concentrate on the cases where the fiber connectivity to the nodes is constrained due to cost. Thereby, we study the performance gains and energy efficiency in the presence of free-space optical (FSO) communication links. Our results indicate hybrid fiber/FSO deployments offer substantial cost savings compared to fully fibered networks, suggesting a beneficial trade-off for strategic link deployment while improving the service coverage probability. As we show, with proper network planning, the service coverage, energy efficiency, and cost efficiency can be improved."

    "abstract": "Achieving flexible and efficient wireless resource sharing across diverse applications and services is among the key goals of the sixth-generation of mobile systems (6G). This work investigates the performance of a real-time system coexisting with a broadband service in a frame-based wireless channel. Specifically, we consider a remote tracking device that monitors an information source and transmits updates to a base station (BS) for real-time source reconstruction, and potential remote actuation. We revise the common idealized assumptions in real-time remote tracking studies, such as instantaneous feedback and pervasive wireless resources, as they do not hold in practical scenarios. We consider a monitoring device and a broadband user communicating with the BS via a grant-free access mechanism over wireless resources defined for either orthogonal or non-orthogonal access, with feedback scheduled at the end of each frame. We analyze system performance using goal-oriented performance metrics for real-time remote reconstruction, alongside throughput and energy efficiency for the broadband user. Our results show that the ‘Idealistic’ model considered in conventional studies achieves better performance but incurs disproportionately high overhead compared to the Frame-Based model. Moreover, within the Frame-Based model, orthogonal resource sharing is preferable for maximizing broadband throughput, while non-orthogonal sharing significantly improves energy efficiency."

    "abstract": "Physical Layer Secret Key Generation (PLSKG), which utilizes wireless channel reciprocity, is increasingly adopted to secure wireless communications. In Time Division Duplexing (TDD) systems, the inherent channel reciprocity facilitates the generation of cryptographic keys without requiring a key exchange process. Conversely, Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) systems present greater challenges for key generation due to the use of distinct frequency bands for uplink and downlink, resulting in differing frequency responses. In this paper, we address this challenge by modeling the channel along with connecting cables as a two-port network and utilizing the reciprocity principles applicable to such networks within the same frequency range. For key generation, we construct the channel profile for each FDD band by utilizing the amplitude of the bidirectional scattering parameters S<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">12</inf> and S<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</inf> in two closely spaced FDD bands, thereby ensuring the required reciprocity in FDD systems. To assess the practicality of the proposed scheme, we analyze its performance across various indoor scenarios and compare it with other key generation schemes using multiple performance indicators. The comparative results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of our scheme in terms of randomness and key disagreement ratio."

Smart External Pulsatile Compression (SEPC) device on the lower leg, that is integrating sophisticated wearable biosensors, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) for passive resistance muscle exercise and peripheral venous return enhancement. Fifty ESRD patients were randomly assigned to the SEPC exercise or the control group. Twenty-five HD patients from a center where intradialytic SEPC was offered thrice weekly and 25 HD patients received usual care HD. Passive exercising patients aimed to SEPC lower leg for 4 hours. After 6 months, the SEPC exercise group presented a significant reduction in measures of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), classical monocytes; all P<0.01]. Six months of regular intradialytic SEPC exercise improved physical function (sit-to-stand 60) and functional capacity. These findings suggest that regular intradialytic SEPC exercise is associated with an anti-inflammatory effect at a circulating cellular level. SEPC improved physical function and functional capacity that is associated with chronic inflammation."

Using HR variations, we evaluate road users’ perceived safety."

    "abstract": "In order to support emerging wireless applications, it is critical to provide users with ubiquitous high data rate connections. The emerging 6G standards are considering utilizing part of the terahertz spectrum for this purpose. However, this part of the spectrum suffers from significant distance based attenuation as well as blockage by most materials including foliage, paper, walls, etc. The challenge therefore is to ensure coverage in complex indoor environments. A second factor that needs to be considered is that for line of sight connections, MIMO capacity is lower than in a rich multi-path environment. Unfortunately, due to propagation limitations, multi-path propagation is mostly absent at this frequency.This paper proposes a novel design for a reflector that satisfies the need for coverage planning as well as providing a multi-path environment which can support high data rate MIMO links. The reflectors consist of multiple passive elements that add a random phase to the reflected signal. We build such reflectors and characterize their performance in a terahertz testbed for frequencies in the range 325 - 500 GHz. We use the channel impulse response to estimate the maximum possible capacity. We show that our reflectors do indeed provide a channel for high capacity MIMO links as compared to polished reflectors that are commonly used for coverage planning."

These previous methods do not take advantage of time-series characteristics that can find the relationship between real events and the extracted topics. Unlike previous methods, we utilized GLIPCA (TSP method) and BERT (NLP method) for the topic extraction task. This approach could not only explore the latent topics from documents by using semantic features, but also improve the interpretability of topics based on the dynamics of trends. We conducted experiments on Vietnamese newspapers with different approaches. As a result, our method outperforms the other methods. These results indicate the potential of a combination of TSP and NLP in exploring the important pattern of trend-topics."

We design suitable resource management techniques that can simultaneously cater to those heterogeneous requirements, and scale appropriately with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of the problem. We propose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns are drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to iteratively update a surrogate model of the environment. Our method leverages a generative flow network (GFlowNet) to sample favorable solutions, as such models are trained to generate compositional objects proportionally to their training reward, hence providing an appropriate coverage of its modes. As such, GFlowNet generates diverse and high return resource management designs that update the surrogate model and swiftly discover suitable solutions. We provide simulation results showing that our method can allocate radio resources achieving 20% performance gains against benchmarks, while requiring less than half of the number of acquisition rounds."

Focusing exclusively on edge data acquisition and transmission to an MQTT broker. The architecture consists of distributed sensor nodes—each based on an ATmega328P microcontroller interfaced with different probes to measure dissolved oxygen, pH, water temperature, ambient humidity, nitrates, and turbidity. The sysmtem is networked via Zigbee (XBee S2) to a central ESP32 coordinator running FreeRTOS. Sensor readings are sampled at configurable intervals, serialized as JSON packets, and relayed over MQTT to a remote server for downstream processing. Emphasis is placed on reliable Zigbee mesh communication, which has been verified to guarantee the connectivity between the modules over time. Also, the system uses a real-time tasks scheduling on FreeRTOS, as well as, employs “last will” messages to detect a communication fault. By isolating the hardware layer and MQTT uplink, this work lays the foundation for scalable, lowcost RAS monitoring deployments without addressing cloud-side visualization or analytics."

    "abstract": "The electric powertrain operates in many kinds of driving forms. The core principle is to make the most of the special traits of separately controllable torque and quick response. By reasonably distributing driving torques to the wheels or transferring torque between axles, the wheels can obtain greater adhesion, ensure the longitudinal driving ability and greater adhesion margin. To broaden the boundary capacity of dynamic handling for a four-wheel-drive electric vehicle, emphasis should be placed on the torque distribution strategy. This research introduces a DP(Dynamic Programming)-based optimal torque allocation and an adaptive RBFNN(Radial Basis Function Neural Network)-PID(Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control strategy for enhancing electric vehicle handling and stability. DP is utilized to obtain the optimal torque distribution coefficient: when oversteering, the coefficient drops from 100% to 0% for stability; during understeer, it rises from 0% to 100% to improve yaw rate response. Co-simulation shows the strategy can pre-emptively control the vehicle and extend its steady-state speed range. Real vehicle tests reveal a 2.7 km/h increase in maximum stable speed relative to front-wheel drive under steady state turns. At 55 km/h yaw with ESP off, it averts instability compared to rear-wheel drive, validating the practical feasibility and effectiveness of proposed control strategy."

A suitable joining technology for this purpose is clinching. This joining technology is already being used for mechanical applications such as joining car body parts or housings. Only in a few applications, clinching is used for current-carrying connections so far. In order to exploit the possible potential of electrical applications, the design of clinch joints and the evaluation criteria must be evolved. For defining the designs of clinch joints for electrical applications, it is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the contact behavior. Therefore, FE-Models were built considering a detailed geometric description of the characteristic areas of the clinch joints. For these areas, a specific Electrical-Contact-Conductance (ECC) was assigned, which maps the contact behavior. The parameterization was validated experimentally. With the FE-Models, the portions of bulk resistance and contact resistance as part of the joint resistance could be determined as well as the relevant current paths in the clinch joints. The results of this study lead to a better understanding of the contact behavior and is a basis for optimization of clinch joints. For the investigated clinch joints, it was found that the highest ECC values have to be set in the bottom-area, in which, in some cases, only a small percentage of the current commutates between the contact partners."

At present, for signal correction, we can use software or hardware, including Wavelet Transform, Fourier Transform and Filters. Based on the existing studies, some use BP and RBF neural networks for EEG signal recognition, and four types of brainwaves, including δ wave, θ wave, α wave and β wave, are used to recognize each signal's source. This paper proposes to use the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) function because its formula is simple and focuses on the maximum value only. Our proposed method replaces the transfer function in the hidden layer of BP neural network with a ReLU function. Through \"training\" in the experiment, the initial weight can be adjusted to reduce bias in neural networks and improve convergence performance for enhancement of anti-interference capability."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of replicating the acoustic properties of natural cane in 3D-printed oboe reeds, given the significant differences in material stiffness. We propose and evaluate a method for tuning the reed’s response by integrating an internal support structure, focusing on geometric modification rather than material alteration. Reeds with and without this structure were fabricated using stereolithography (SLA) and their acoustic performance and mechanical compliance were compared against traditional cane reeds. Acoustic analysis revealed that while the supported reed exhibited harmonic profiles similar to cane in the low and high registers, it produced significant harmonic amplification in the mid-register (C5-G5). This amplification is attributed to a 15% decrease in mechanical compliance, confirmed via static load tests, which lowered the reed’s natural frequency and caused resonance. This research demonstrates that geometric design is an effective strategy for controlling the resonance of synthetic reeds, offering a promising pathway to compensate for material property disparities and tune acoustic characteristics."

Here, we use laser shadowgraphy to monitor in-situ the wear of copper, aluminum and steel surfaces during arcing at currents up to 1 kA. During arcing, a pool of molten metal forms at the arc attachment region. We observe bubbles that develop and burst, leading to the emission of molten metal drops. Using image processing techniques, we track the evolution of the contour of the electrode’s surface and evaluate the evolution of the wear with varying current, material, and current flow direction. When going from copper to aluminum and steel, bubbling during arcing gets stronger, which we attribute to the respective micro-structure, thermal properties and surface tension of these metals. Finally, cathodes and anodes exhibit different bubbling behavior, which we discuss in terms of arc root diameter and motion, current density and temperature at the arc root location."

    "abstract": "With the ongoing convergence of radar, electronic warfare, and communications, receivers demand real-time spectral analysis that is ultra-wideband, low-latency, and highthroughput. To meet these requirements under low-cost and small-form-factor constraints, we propose a real-time frequencymeasurement scheme that combines RFSoC direct sampling and 1-bit quantization with a fully parallel, pipelined FFT. The RF signal is directly sampled by the high-speed ADC integrated in the RFSoC, while a 256 -point, fully parallel, pipelined FFT is implemented on the PL side, yielding one spectrum per clock cycle. With 1-bit inputs, the core computation avoids DSP multipliers and is implemented primarily using LUT resources. The consistency verification based on MATLAB and Verilog shows that the main peak localization and spectral morphology are consistent with the reference spectrum. The platform adopts Zynq UltraScale+RFSoC. Under experimental conditions, the maximum sampling rate can reach <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.9 \\text{GS} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex>.

This paper introduces a CSI-driven framework for estimating the number of mobile robots in a controlled indoor setting and for localizing an individual robot within predefined spatial zones.

With the focus on coherent OAC, we introduce phase-coded pilots (PCPs), a strategy where the radios communicate with each other to eliminate the round-trip phase change in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) to align the phase of the received symbol at a desired angle. In this study, considering a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-resilient multi-user procedure, we derive the statistics of the phase deviations to assess how fast the phase coherency degrades. Our results show that residual CFO is a major factor determining the duration of phase coherency, in addition to the non-negligible effects of mobility and the number of nodes in the network. We also provide a proof-of-concept demonstration for coherent signal superposition by using off-the-shelf radios to demonstrate the feasibility of PCPs in practice."

Meanwhile, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a significant increase in model inference demands, which come with stringent latency requirements. In this paper, considering the intelligent services in SAGVN, we explore the co-inference problem and improve the inference efficiency by performing model splitting, vehicle association, and resource allocation. This problem is solved iteratively by decomposing it into multiple sub-problems. In particular, the model splitting problem is addressed by systematically searching for the optimal split points. Besides, the joint vehicle association and resource allocation problem are reformulated into a monotone submodular function without satellites, and then a low-complexity submodular optimization algorithm is proposed. To further utilize the computing power of the satellite, we further introduce a resource reallocation algorithm based on the existing optimization results. These two subproblems can iterate alternately until the optimization goal converges. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better latency performance in several inference tasks."

To effectively solve the complicated task, we propose a novel multi-head self-attention-assisted reinforcement learning (MH-SARL) algorithm. In our algorithm, the communication head is designed to search for the optimal resource allocation policy to maximize transmission throughput, whilst the sensing head focuses on suggesting adequate spectrum utilization to satisfy the predefined sensing quality.

TinyML is the deployment of machine learning models on lowpower, resource-constrained devices at the edge. Rather than relying on a single monolithic model, our method allows switching between classification models of varying complexity based on user preferences or system conditions. Inspired by power-saving modes in consumer electronics, we introduce a method where users can select between a high-accuracy or energy-saving mode. Using a Random Forest classifier on the HAR, WISDM and PAMAP2 datasets and deploying models to STM32MP257F MPU, we demonstrate that varying the number of decision trees allows a balance between prediction accuracy and energy consumption. Experimental results show that energy savings (depending on the mode) can be achieved with minimal loss of classification quality. This flexible model-switching approach offers a promising direction for future adaptive TinyML systems, especially in battery-constrained environments."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for cognitive radio (CR)-enabled integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (ITNTNs), comprising a primary low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite network and a secondary terrestrial network. In particular, a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) mounted secondary base station (BS) reuses the same spectrum to communicate with the secondary user. The proposed framework improves the energy efficiency of the secondary network while ensuring that the interference temperature threshold of the primary LEO network is not violated. The joint optimization of BS power allocation and BD-RIS phase shifts is considered, which results in a highly nonconvex problem. To address this challenge, the Dinkelbach method is first employed to transform the fractional objective function, followed by the development of an alternating optimization strategy. Specifically, the BS power allocation is optimized using the Lagrangian method with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, while the BD-RIS phase shifts are updated through manifold optimization techniques. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BD-RIS framework performs better than conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) configurations in terms of energy and spectral efficiency, highlighting its potential to enable green, adaptive, and high-capacity 6G ITNTN deployments."

More recently, these models have also enabled the achievement of one-shot video tuning with pre-trained T2I models. Despite the feasibility, prior techniques still struggle to handle the scenarios with multiple moving objects, leading to less consistent motions and object merging. To mitigate this issue, we propose to leverage multi-channel mask guidance to dynamically navigate frame-wise object location. Specifically, we perform object segmentation for each moving object in the video to prepare a multi-channel mask image sequence. By incorporating such a mask sequence into the cross-attention-based T2I diffusion pipeline, the frame-wise location of multiple objects can be explicitly guided to combat the tendency of object merging. Experimental results show that our approach improves the video quality and realism against existing T2V methods."

Subsequently, the equivalent sampled DAFT channel matrix is visualized. Additionally, an analysis of the auto-ambiguity function of the AFDM pilot signal is conducted, focusing on the impact of various DAC and ADC filters. The selection of these filters exerts a significant influence on the sidelobe behavior in the time-delay domain of the sub-ambiguity function.

    "abstract": "Object detection serves as the fundamental cornerstone of autonomous driving perception technology. By precisely and promptly identifying traffic participants in the vicinity of the vehicle, the object detection model delivers safety warnings and protection to the driver. Corner case detection in autonomous driving remains a critical and challenging area of research due to the complex environmental conditions and irregular object shapes involved, such as a self-driving car dealing with sudden pedestrians, non-standard traffic signs, road works, and animals crossing the road. These scenarios demand higher robustness and accuracy from object detection algorithms. Existing research often inadequately addresses these complexities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world applications. This study delves into corner case detection in autonomous driving and proposes an improved objective detection model based on You Only Look Once version 10 (YOLOv10). In this paper, the Depth-Wise Convolution (DWConv) and Omni-Dimensional Convolution (ODConv) are integrated into the backbone and head modules of the original YOLOv10 algorithm. Comparative experiments demonstrate that these improvements significantly enhance the original YOLOv10's ability to detect complex corner cases, achieving a 2.9% average precision (AP) improvement and a 24.5% mean average recall (mAR) improvement on the widely-used Corner Case Dataset (CODA). The results indicate that the modified YOLOv10 maintains competitive inference speed while providing higher precision, showcasing the potential of targeted architectural enhancements in improving corner case detection for autonomous driving. This advancement contributes to improving the efficiency and safety of self-driving vehicle operations."

Meanwhile, to overcome its limitation in pulse energy and bandwidth, dispersion-management and spectral filtering effects are routinely used to mitigate nonlinearity induced instabilities through temporal and spectral stretching in the cavity. In this work, we demonstrate that, by simply introducing a large lumped attenuation in a soliton fiber laser, significant temporal and spectral stretching can be achieved despite the dominant anomalous dispersion of the fiber cavity, allowing for a stretched-pulse-like operation without using dispersion-compensation fibers and bandpass filters. In experiment, we achieved prominent pulse energy and bandwidth scaling by applying a lumped 13-dB attenuation before the gain section, which leads to 8-nm pulse bandwidth. Numerical simulations were performed to reveal the dramatic oscillation of the pulse chirp in the cavity in the all-anomalous fiber sections. This work revealed the critical role of lump attenuation in mode-locked cavity in manipulating the intra cavity dynamics of soliton laser, and may serve as a simple and useful degree of freedom for optimization of mode-locked fiber lasers"

This study investigated the impact of cultural differences on the risk perception of pedestrians during cycling and the effect of warning system on the difference in risk perception. The results showed that Japanese participants felt pedestrians were more dangerous compared to non-Japanese participants.

However, DL-based receivers often face challenges such as poor generalization to unseen channel conditions and difficulty in effectively tracking rapid channel fluctuations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid receiver architecture that integrates the strengths of both traditional and neural receivers. The core innovation is a discriminator neural network trained to dynamically select the optimal receiver whether it is the traditional or DL-based receiver according on the received OFDM block characteristics. This discriminator is trained using labeled pilot signals that encode the comparative performance of both receivers. By including anomalous channel scenarios in training, the proposed hybrid receiver achieves robust performance, effectively overcoming the generalization issues inherent in standalone DL approaches."

The problem formalized as Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) traditionally assumes uniform agent sizes, which limits its applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this issue, MAPF for Large Agents (LA-MAPF), which considers the physical size of agents, has been proposed. In this study, we apply Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT)―a MAPF algorithm based on dynamic priority inheritance and backtracking―to the LA-MAPF setting and evaluate its effectiveness. Specifically, we propose two priority assignment strategies that adjust agent priorities according to their sizes, and compare their performance across various map configurations and number of agents. Experimental results demonstrate that the strategy assigning higher priorities to smaller agents achieves superior performance, especially in densely populated environments and complex terrains, thereby enhancing overall path planning efficiency."

    "abstract": "When operating in marine environments, the power conversion link of direct-drive grid-connected permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) units may be subject to various types of faults, such as short-circuit faults in the generator windings and open-circuit faults in the converter. Due to the high maintenance cost, once a generator fault occurs, it will cause huge economic losses. For this reason, it is significant to investigate the impact of different faults of grid-connected wind power units on the generator. In this article, the coupled electromagnetic–thermal converter calculation model is established for a direct-drive offshore PMSG with a rated power of 5 MW and a rated speed of 15 r/min. In addition, the generator loss distributions under four types of machine-side converter open-circuit faults and four types of grid-side inverter open-circuit faults are calculated. Particular attention is given to the distribution of the eddy-current loss of the rotor magnet box. On this basis, the transient effects of different faults on the temperatures of the generator windings and permanent magnets are investigated. The dimensionless number global rise time is used as the evaluation index in this research. The index reveals the impact of different faults on the generator stability by indicating the time it takes for the generator’s key components to reach the temperature tolerance limit. The findings provide a basis for enhancing the transient operation capability of wind generators under extreme fault conditions."

To ensure the monotonicity of TSK-FIS, sufficient conditions are first derived and modeled as constraints. Then, the TSK-FIS parameters are optimized for three objectives: 1) the optimality objective enables the TSK-FIS to learn the expert knowledge from existing tools, ensuring alignment with established utility practices; 2) the robustness objective enhances its ability to prevent minor input changes from causing drastic output deviations; 3) to ensure such small input variations can still be reflected in the output to a meaningful extent, the differentiation objective is formulated to improve output resolution and mitigate over-concentration.

Meanwhile, existing DNN watermarking methods are intrusive in nature, requiring direct or indirect modification of model parameters for watermark embedding, which raises fidelity concerns. To solve the above problems, we propose the first nonintrusive and robust watermarking method for CycleGAN. We empirically show that without modifying the CycleGAN model, a user-defined watermark image can still be extracted from model outputs using a dedicated watermark decoder. Extensive experimental results verify that while achieving the so-called absolute fidelity, the proposed method is robust to various attacks, from image post-processing to model stealing."

While LiDAR-based approaches are favored for their accuracy in 3D perception and resilience to illumination changes, existing methods often suffer from complex scene representations or computationally intensive processes, hindering scalability in large-scale applications. This paper introduces SGE-GLoc, a novel LiDAR-based global localization framework, which utilizes a compact scene graph representation where individual objects are modeled as Semantic Gaussian Ellipsoids (SGEs), encapsulating both geometric and semantic attributes. For efficient place recognition, we encode SGE features into histograms and employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn local and global topological information, generating a discriminative two-stage descriptor for scene similarity scoring. For accurate 6-DoF transformation estimation, we first establish initial correspondences based on SGE matching and subsequently refine the transformation by exploiting geometric constraints between SGEs. Extensive evaluations on four public datasets, including KITTI, KITTI-360, Apollo, and HeLiPR, demonstrate that SGE-GLoc achieves high place recognition accuracy and low localization error, while maintaining a highly compact scene graph representation with an average storage of only 1.28 KB per scene. Furthermore, the integration of SGE-GLoc into a SLAM system showcases its practical efficacy in real-world scenarios."

Prior approaches often assume fixed goals, reducing goal prediction to a one-time inference. However, in real-world scenarios, humans frequently shift goals, making it challenging for robots to adapt without explicit communication. We propose a method for detecting goal changes by tracking multiple candidate action sequences and verifying their plausibility against a policy bank. Upon detecting a change, the robot refines its belief in relevant past actions and constructs Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) trees to actively select actions that assist the human while encouraging Differentiating Actions to reveal their updated goal. We evaluate our approach in a collaborative cooking environment with up to 30 unique recipes and compare it to three comparable human goal prediction algorithms. Our method outperforms all baselines, quickly converging to the correct goal after a switch, reducing task completion time and improving collaboration efficiency."

    "abstract": "Images of permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) acquired from lunar orbit are challenging to model and interpret because of the diffuse secondary illumination. In this work, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel technique to model the radiance of PSRs with diffuse secondary illumination based on the Lommel-Seeliger law. We compare our results based on Lambert’s law and show that while both models reproduce details of Shoemaker crater PSR images observed by ShadowCam, the new technique is dramatically more accurate in scale."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for channel state information (CSI) feedback. While recent research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy on a specific dataset through novel architectures, the underlying mechanism of AI-based CSI feedback remains unclear. This study explores the mechanism through analyzing performance across diverse datasets, with findings suggesting that superior feedback performance stems from AI models’ strong fitting capabilities and their ability to leverage environmental knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a prompt-enabled large AI model (LAM) for CSI feedback. The LAM employs powerful Transformer blocks and is trained on extensive datasets from various scenarios. Meanwhile, the channel distribution (environmental knowledge), represented as the mean of channel magnitude in the angular-delay domain, is incorporated as a scenario-specific prompt within the decoder to further enhance reconstruction quality. Simulation results confirm that the proposed prompt-enabled LAM significantly improves feedback accuracy and generalization performance while reducing data collection requirements in new scenarios."

    "abstract": "Ensuring personnel safety during power station inspections is a critical yet challenging task due to inherent hazards in such environments. Traditional monitoring methods, including wearable devices and video surveillance, suffer from user discomfort, limited visibility, and high deployment costs. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes PowerHAR, a device-free framework for recognizing power inspection activities based on WiFi channel state information (CSI) acquired from custom-designed ESP32 internet of things (IoT) sensors. PowerHAR introduces a spatio-temporal feature distribution-based power operation recognition network, comprising a transformer-based preprocessing module capable of effectively handling variable-length CSI sequences, and a spatio-temporal extraction module that integrates convolutional operations with multihead self-attention mechanisms for comprehensive feature fusion. By leveraging mutual CSI sensing among distributed sensors, PowerHAR provides robust and accurate recognition of power inspection activities without requiring additional hardware infrastructure. Experimental validation demonstrates that PowerHAR significantly surpasses existing baseline methods, confirming its high reliability and practicality in safety-critical industrial scenarios."

Detection of such nodes through machine learning (ML) algorithms establishes a robust defense mechanism, enabling the monitoring of node behavior and the mitigation of potential threats. In this context, effective anomaly detection in WSNs utilizing ELS-SVM fosters a secure environment, further strengthened by transparent logging and secure data storage (SDS) via blockchain technology.

Existing SLAM datasets often focus on outdoor environments, rely on a single type of LiDAR sensor, or lack additional sensor data such as wheel odometry in ground-based robotic platforms. Consequently, the existing datasets lack data diversity required to comprehensively evaluate performance under diverse indoor conditions. The IILABS 3D dataset fills this gap by providing a sensor-rich, indoor-exclusive dataset recorded in a controlled laboratory environment using a wheeled mobile robot platform. It includes four heterogeneous 3D LiDAR sensors – Velodyne VLP-16, Ouster OS1-64, RoboSense RS-Helios-5515, and Livox Mid-360 – featuring both mechanical spinning and non-repetitive scanning patterns, as well as an IMU and wheel odometry for sensor fusion. The dataset also contains calibration sequences, challenging benchmark trajectories, and high-precision ground-truth poses captured with a motion capture system. Using this dataset, we benchmark nine representative LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms across multiple sequences, analyzing their performance in terms of accuracy and consistency under varying sensor configurations. The results provide a comprehensive performance comparison and valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current SLAM algorithms in indoor environments. The dataset, benchmark results, and related tools are publicly available at https://jorgedfr.github.io/3d_lidar_slam_benchmark_at_iilab/."

To address this problem, this paper proposes a finite-time (FT) braking torque consensus control strategy based on interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno (IT2 T-S) fuzzy theory. First, a heterogeneous EMB multi-agent system framework is established to describe the communication topology among EMB units, providing a more accurate representation under non-uniform parameter uncertainties. Second, a distributed IT2 T-S fuzzy braking torque FT <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</sub> consensus controller is designed. The EMB system is linearized using IT2 T-S fuzzy theory, and an augmented membership function is introduced, which enhances the capability of the model and controller in handling parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Then, a fuzzy Lyapunov function reduced the conservatism of the consensus control, thereby effectively minimizing the braking torque error between left and right wheels, and FT constraints achieved rapid convergence. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves the braking torque consensus of the four-wheel EMB system under different braking conditions with non-uniform parameter uncertainties, thus ensuring braking safety."

This paper presents Niagara, a new single-view 3D scene reconstruction framework that can faithfully reconstruct challenging outdoor scenes from a single input image for the first time. Our approach integrates monocular depth and normal estimation as input, which substantially improves its ability to capture fine details, mitigating common issues like geometric detail loss and deformation. Additionally, we introduce a geometric affine field (GAF) and 3D self-attention as geometry-constraint, which combines the structural properties of explicit geometry with the adaptability of implicit feature fields, striking a balance between efficient rendering and high-fidelity reconstruction. Our framework finally proposes a specialized encoder-decoder architecture, where a depth-based 3D Gaussian decoder is proposed to predict 3D Gaussian parameters, which can be used for novel view synthesis. Extensive results and analyses suggest that our Niagara surpasses prior SoTA approaches such as Flash3D in both single-view and dual-view settings, significantly enhancing the geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, especially in outdoor scenes.

    "abstract": "The accurate prediction of protein–ligand binding affinity is crucial for early-stage drug discovery. Sequence-based deep learning models offer scalability and broader applicability than structure-based methods, but typically ignore the local binding site context, limiting predictive power. Recent advances in protein structure prediction and binding pocket detection have enabled for the integration of pocket-level information into sequence-based models. We present TUNA, a novel deep learning model that integrates multi-modal features to predict binding affinity. The TUNA integrates global protein sequences, localized pocket representations, ligand features derived from the SMILES, and molecular graph structures. We used three dimensional structure inference and pocket detection tools for proteins lacking experimentally determined binding sites. The pocket and protein sequences were encoded using embeddings from pre-trained models, including a model pretrained specifically on pocket-derived sequences. Ligands were represented through a fusion of Chemformer encoded SMILES and graph diffusion-based features, then unified via an alignment strategy to preserve both symbolic and structural information. TUNA achieved consistent improvements over sequence-based models across the PDB bind and BindingDB datasets while remaining competitive with structure-based methods for the PDBbind dataset. Its interpretable cross-modal attention mechanism enables the inference of potential binding sites, thus enhancing biological interpretation. These results demonstrate that TUNA is an effective affinity prediction method, especially for targets without known structures."

However, domain experts find it difficult to optimize the furnace temperature setpoint and ensure its tracking under manual control mode to minimize typical pollutant emission concentrations. This article proposes a double-layer optimization control strategy for furnace temperature optimized setpoint and tracking control. First, a genetic algorithm is used in the upper layer to determine the furnace temperature setpoint aimed at minimizing pollutant emissions of NOx and C02. Then, the fitness function for the lower-layer optimization process is defined as the integral of time-weighted absolute error (IT AE) of a multi-loop PID controller, and a genetic algorithm is employed to find the optimal PID parameters for the controller. Finally, the control variables output by the PID controller are fed into the controlled object, and the actual temperature values are fed back to form a closed-loop optimization control. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy dynamically determines the optimal FT setpoint and concurrently identifies optimal multi-loop PID controller parameters that are best suited for the optimal FT setpoint."

This study explores a bioinspired, chemistry-free approach utilizing picosecond-pulsed Direct Laser Interference Patterning (ps-DLIP) as a promising technique. Ps-DLIP has demonstrated efficacy on materials such as copper and tin, and intriguingly, due to the short pulse duration, it is also applicable to silver materials despite the 532 nm wavelength, which typically does not absorb well in pure silver. Silver is of particular interest as it is commonly used in the connector industry. With DLIP, surface topographies can be reproducibly manufactured with high precision. Several periodicities and tilt angles were investigated to optimize the frictional properties. At first, the topography of the structured samples was studied thoroughly, a measurement routine was developed and different surface parameters were investigated. Subsequent tribo-electric characterization, i.e. insertion/removal tests, were conducted to evaluate the performance of the treated surfaces. The results indicate that ps-DLIP is a viable method for adapting the frictional behavior of silver and other materials, with potential applications in the connector industry."

These estimates feed a lightweight MLP that jointly optimizes RIS amplitude–phase settings via a custom loss balancing SINR enhancement with angle-estimation fidelity. A convolutional notch filtering step then deepens the null at the interference direction, and a subcarrier-pooling strategy fuses per-frequency spectra to ensure uniform suppression across the band. Simulation results under automotive radar conditions demonstrate robust interference mitigation, high angular resolution, and precise angle recovery in dense environments."

To solve this problem, we design a novel distributed heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) architecture for beamforming and power control with a low signaling overhead.

    "abstract": "In the field of non-cooperative network topology inference for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks, current causality discovery-based methodologies typically depend on critical assumptions that the data and acknowledgment (ACK) frames can be reliably distinguished and that the prior knowledge of transmission configurations, such as packet size, is available. However, in real-world scenarios, due to feature variations stemming from heterogeneous device configurations and undisclosed protocols, such assumptions are difficult to be satisfied. This paper proposes Frame-Agnostic Adaptive Causal Topology Inference (FAAC-TI), a novel network topology inference framework that overcomes the above limitations through two innovations. First, we propose Self-Informed Transfer Entropy (SITE) utilized as causality metric in FAAC-TI, which integrates the source node’s own past history contribution with cross-node causal influence, eliminating the conventional dependence on pre-classification of Data/ACK frames. Second, FAAC-TI contains a data-driven adaptive parameter selection scheme which determines parameters through run-length statistical characterization of binary time series when calculating causality metric, obviating the need for prior knowledge as previously mentioned. Experimental results show that the SITE metric achieves significantly higher topology inference accuracy on average than transfer entropy (TE) baselines across varying network scales and dynamics, while the adaptive parameter selection scheme maintains close deviation from the conventional parameter presetting scheme based on prior knowledge."

With the introduction of more and more electronic devices in vehicles, these devices need to be powered, and efficient recovery and utilisation of the waste heat is required. Thermoelectric power generation is a promising method for converting exhaust heat into effective energy. In this study, a thermoelectric collector for waste heat recovery from the exhaust pipe of an internal combustion engine was investigated. Numerical simulations were carried out to analyse the heat transfer characteristics from the exhaust gases to the thermoelectric module in order to optimise the heat recovery during engine start-up. These results are intended to improve the efficiency of heat recovery, predict the amount of electricity generated and contribute to improved energy utilisation in vehicles with internal combustion engines."

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robot (AMR) systems in indoor environments face challenges in jointly optimizing visual navigation and communication efficiency. Existing methods often decouple path planning from communication allocation or rely on simplified 2D models, limiting adaptability to 3D environments.. To address these limitations, we introduce the non-orthogonal multiple access technology to enhance spectral efficiency and ensure real-time control during AMR movement. We formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the long-term average data rate via coordinated planning of AMR trajectories, transmit power, and precoding matrix. To handle wireless fading and localization inaccuracy, we propose a vision-enhanced federated deep reinforcement learning framework, where AMRs independently learn policies while engaging in privacy-preserving model aggregation. Leveraging RGB-D visual features, object detection, and egocentric pose estimation, our approach enables robust decision-making in 3D environments under imprecise localization. Extensive experiments on the RoboThor simulator demonstrate that our proposed framework accelerates training convergence, improves navigation and communication efficiency, and outperforms baselines in reward accumulation."

The proposed work called “Emotion-driven Music Recommendation Using CNN and Dynamic Data Source Integration” gives personalized music recommendations based on real-time user emotions, age, and gender. The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to ascertain facial expressions through activating the camera light for detecting the user’s emotional state and demographic profile. Attributes such as energy, valence, and other music features are then dynamically mapped around the user’s emotional disposition and thereby join forces to create recommendations with a ray of their current mood. This system will be high on personalization by including the smart deep learning models and scalable database solutions that keep the user experience interesting and satisfying. Real-time emotion detection and integration of external APIs could generally contrive the system to radical change the thinking of music recommendation. This paper discusses the architectural features and case study instances of this system in clarifying how it provides emotion-driven curation of music while considering their age and gender."

    "abstract": "The increasing consumption of streaming content on mobile devices and its transmission to secondary screens, such as televisions, reinforces the need for reliable methods to assess the quality of the video consumed. The central challenge of this work lies in the ability to perform a reliable analysis, capable of detecting subtle variations between the original and received content, which can be introduced by factors such as compression and losses in the wireless network. The methodology uses the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to capture frames from the mobile device, OpenCV for image processing, Peak Signal-toNoise Ratio (PSNR) to indicate the noise level of the wireless network, K-Means to partition the data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the closest centroid and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) to assess the similarity between the transmitted and received data. The results demonstrate that the quality of the transmitted video reaches levels above $98 \\%$ similarity with the original content, indicating that the main degradation factor is the compression intrinsic to the transmission process via the Wi-Fi network. This finding gives high reliability to the proposed method, even in potentially noisy scenarios, consolidating it as an effective tool for evaluating the quality of video transmission between mobile devices and secondary screens."

In addition to looking for compression performances, protection of BCS plays another key role for robust data transmission. In our scenario, original image can be classified into smooth and active blocks, and then different measurement rates in BCS can be applied. BCS compressed data would be presented with the binary format to form bitstreams for transmitting over binary channels. Considering the concept of unequal error protection, different level of protection can be accomplished with the polar codes. Compressed bistreams protected with polar codes can be transmitted over the binary symmetric channel (BSC), and errors may be induced during transmission. After reception, polar decoding and BCS reconstruction can be utilized subsequently to obtain reconstructed image. Simulations have shown the advantages of using the inherent characteristics of original image and the concept of unequal error protection over conventional settings."

While human pose estimation has benefited from large-scale annotated datasets and deep learning techniques, animal pose estimation faces unique challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of annotated datasets. The importance of animal pose estimation is emphasized in understanding animal behavior, physiology, and neurological conditions, particularly in small animals where precise tracking of movements is crucial for studying neurological diseases, pain, and behavioral disorders. Despite progress with datasets like ImageNet and AP-10K, existing resources lack the comprehensive pose information required for high-performance neural networks. This paper highlights these challenges through a Sim-to-Real strategy, synthesizing an annotated dataset in Blender software, followed by the training of the YOLOV5 detection model and HRNet pose estimation model on it. Finally, the evaluation of these models is discussed throughout the training process. This presents possible solutions and innovations in the field to improve the accuracy and applicability of animal pose estimation systems."

Experiments demonstrate VPT’s significant superiority over k-dimensional (K-D) tree and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in sparse high-dimensional scenarios, reducing index construction time by up to 61% and achieving a 90% Top-100 recall rate. However, VPT’s retrieval performance becomes unstable in dense low-dimensional environments due to static partition-boundary effects and leaf-node overload. Future research will focus on partition-boundary optimization, dynamic node splitting, and hybrid storage architectures to enhance the adaptability of dense vectors and overcome memory bottlenecks.

Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">acoustic</i> tokens and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">semantic</i> tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens."

To enable studying ISAC solutions, standardization bodies such as European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) require specified ISAC channel models. 3GPP has been studying changes to the existing TR 38.901 channel models to model radio-frequency (RF) signal interactions between the transmitter, sensing target, receiver, and surrounding environment. In parallel, ETSI has been working on additional features to further support channel modelling for the rich variety of ISAC use cases envisioned in 6G.

    "abstract": "Frequency multipliers are increasingly utilized for signal up-conversion in modern wireless communication systems, particularly in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) bands, owning to their simplicity and ease of integration. However, their inherent nonlinearity causes distortions, fundamentally altering the temporal and spectral characteristics of transmitted signals. This distortion transforms well-defined baseband pulses (e.g., sinc, raised cosine) into complex, hardware-dependent waveforms, where the matched-filter depends both on the multiplication order and the specific hardware implementation. Notably, the spectral occupancy of the transmitted signal expands after frequency multiplication. Without accurate knowledge of the multiplier-induced distortions at the receiver, applying a mismatched filter can cause severe inter-symbol interference and loss of critical frequency components, signal-to-noise ratio degradation thereby degrading detection performance. In this paper, we propose a blind, adaptive matched-filter estimation approach leveraging a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Our method directly estimates the matched filter from sampled segments of the noisy modulated received signal without requiring pilot symbols. The proposed model adapts to dynamic pulse shapes and amplitudes by implicitly learning the spectral transformations introduced by hardware-induced nonlinearities. Simulation results demonstrate high accuracy of the matched filter estimation, with a mean-square error precision of four decimal places."

As the workload for dairy farmers grows due to a decreasing workforce, there is a strong need for safer and more efficient solutions. In this study, we propose a contactless method to estimate cattle weight using a depth camera. This study differentiates itself from other studies by placing the camera above the cow, making it more versatile. We extracted depth images and calculated key body measurements: height, body length, and belly width. Based on these values, we created a regression formula to estimate weight. Our results show that it is possible to estimate cattle weight roughly using only the values obtained from depth images. This method reduces the risk of injuries during measurement and offers a more efficient way to manage cattle health and nutrition."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture where two types of aerial infrastructures together with a ground station provide connectivity to a remote area. A high altitude platform station (HAPS) is equipped with reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), called HAPS-RIS, to be exploited to assist the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based wireless networks. A key challenge in such networks is the restricted number of UAVs, which limits full coverage and leaves some users unsupported. To tackle this issue, we propose a hierarchical bilevel optimization framework including a leader and a follower problem. The users served by HAPS-RIS are in a zone called the HAPS-RIS zone and the users served by the UAVs are in another zone called the UAV zone. In the leader problem, the goal is to establish the zone boundary and practical RIS phase shift design that maximizes the number of users covered by HAPS-RIS while ensuring that users in this zone meet their rate requirements. This is achieved through our proposed practical relaxation method and the proposed dynamic radius-based zone association with RIS clustering (DyRaZARC) technique. The follower problem focuses on minimizing the number of UAVs required, ensuring that the rate requirements of the users in the UAV zone are met. This is addressed through our proposed novel geometry-informed machine learning method, called k-means adaptive dynamic UAV selection (KADUS) technique. Our study reveals that increasing the number of RIS elements significantly decreases the number of required UAVs."

    "abstract": "In this study, DNA is modeled as a finite string over the alphabet {A, C, G, T}. A protein is similarly represented as a finite string over a 20-letter alphabet, with each letter corresponding to one of the standard amino acids (e.g., A for alanine, R for arginine, N for asparagine, and so on). Translation from DNA to protein is defined by a function that maps every three-letter substring (codon) from the DNA alphabet to a single letter in the protein alphabet. For example, GCT maps to alanine (A), CGT to arginine (R), AAT to asparagine (N), and so on. Building on this principle, a DNA-Based Computing (DBC) algorithm is developed to address machine learning tasks. In this work, a DBC-based framework is proposed for pattern recognition in images. The framework extracts a time series signal from a given image, encodes it into multiple DNA sequences, and translates them into a protein-like string. The entropy of n-grams within this string is used as a numerical index for quantifying the image. In a case study involving two visually different images of the same object, the framework successfully indexed them as equivalent, demonstrating DBC’s potential for robust, image-based inference in smart manufacturing."

However, conventional RFID-based systems typically perform position estimation in two dimensions, limiting their ability to determine vertical positions or distinguish overlapping items. This paper introduces a three-dimensional positioning system that arranges RFID antennas in a spatial configuration. The system employs four directional antennas—two oriented horizontally and two vertically―to receive signals from multiple angles. By adjusting the tilt of each antenna, the system induces position-dependent variations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and phase values, resulting in distinctive spatial signal patterns. The proposed configuration captures vertical information and extends positioning capabilities beyond traditional two-dimensional methods. Experimental validation using a prototype system confirms the feasibility of accurate three-dimensional localization. A comparative evaluation using grid-based classification and multiple machine learning algorithms further demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

We proposed a framework that detects the aerosol concentration levels via the channel state information (CSI) of the ambient WiFi signal with the help of low-complexity machine learning (ML) classifiers that can process CSI data on the embedded devices. We experimentally validated the feasibility of the proposed framework with a prototype system implemented with wide-deployable commodity hardware. We demonstrated empirically that the proposed framework can predict aerosol concentration levels with 99% average accuracy via edge computing on an embedded system with tailored pre-processing. We evaluated the robustness of our proposed technology with practical aerosol materials and achieved more than 97% accuracy for both graffiti paint and air refresher.

    "abstract": "This article introduces and evaluates adaptive polynomial Kolmogorov–Arnold network (AdaptPolyKAN) architectures for intelligent fault diagnosis, addressing limitations of classical KANs in dynamic and nonlinear industrial systems. While classical KANs offer interpretability, their fixed univariate mappings lack the flexibility needed for evolving operating conditions. The proposed AdaptPolyKAN uses adaptive polynomial expansions that adjust the degree of each basis according to local reconstruction errors, enabling real-time adaptation, improved accuracy, and efficient handling of complex nonstationary fault patterns. Three variants are examined-Standard PolyKAN, SplineKAN, and Online PolyKAN-alongside the proposed AdaptPolyKAN. Their performance is benchmarked against classical KAN, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and random forest models in both real and simulated fault scenarios. The evaluation uses datasets from a cement rotary kiln at the Ain El Kebira plant, consisting of 768 normal samples, multiple simulated sensor faults, and one real fault. Monitored variables include temperatures, pressures, motor currents, and rotational speeds from 44 sensors recorded at 20-s intervals. The dataset contains noise, class imbalance, and limited duration, reflecting realistic industrial conditions. Comprehensive metrics—including accuracy, precision, recall, F1- score, false alarm rate (FAR), and missed detection rate (MDR)—demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. AdaptPolyKAN achieves 98.4% accuracy, balanced precision and recall (98.3% and 98.4%), and the lowest FAR (0.0060), while maintaining competitive MDR (0.178). Online PolyKAN adapts effectively to changing fault patterns, whereas classical KAN suffers from elevated false alarms. Overall, AdaptPolyKAN provides reliable detection in nonlinear and time-varying processes, offering a practical and interpretable solution for safety-critical industrial environments."

    "abstract": "Graduation albums are used to store the many events and memories experienced throughout the students' school life. However, the production of graduation albums requires a large amount of time and effort to select appropriate images from a huge collection of images, and there is a growing demand for an automatic graduation album photo selection system. Conventional image selection systems are not practical for graduation album production because of problems such as false detection of face blurring. In this study, face blur detection using frequency components of the face region and blink detection using feature points of the eyes are applied to a group of main subjects determined from depth values and areas. Then, we propose an appropriate automatic selection method for graduation album photos."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the leading causes of dementia worldwide, posing a major challenge for its early and accurate diagnosis. Although conventional techniques are useful, they rely heavily on clinical judgment and may be limited in early stages. In this context, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as an effective alternative for the automated analysis of medical images. This work presents the development and implementation of two CNN-based models for the classification of 2D brain MRI images across different stages of Alzheimer's disease, a custom model built from scratch, and a transfer learning model using the pre-trained VGG16 architecture. The models were trained and evaluated using a public dataset from Kaggle, with images categorized into four clinical stages. Results show that the custom model achieved <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{9 6. 5 \\%}$</tex> accuracy, significantly outperforming the transfer learning model, which reached 70 %. Additionally, a graphical user interface was designed to allow users to visualize the predictions from both models, enhancing their potential clinical application. The findings highlight the effectiveness of CNNs for assisted diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and emphasize the importance of adapting architectures to medical data."

This paper introduces an innovative optimization framework that accounts for lithium-ion battery aging, modeling both calendar and cycle degradation with a novel segment-based approach. Designed for seamless integration into cost-effective energy planning, the framework optimizes photovoltaic (PV) panel and battery sizing to minimize costs and extend system lifespan. Validated using real-world base station power consumption data, our approach outperforms traditional rainflow-based aging models, reducing battery cycle wear by up to 65.5% compared to aging-unaware methods and by an additional 10% over rainflow-based methods. By enabling real-time battery health tracking, it supports dynamic energy management, offering a practical solution for sustainable telecom networks."

By modeling packet transmission in networks with finite-length queues and employing meta distribution analysis, we derive precise expressions for delay and packet loss probability. Our findings show that when queue capacities are limited, the transmission success probability significantly influences packet loss behavior. Specifically, a sharp increase in packet loss occurs when the transmission success probability drops below a critical threshold. While increasing queue length does not mitigate packet loss in suboptimal transmission conditions, it can notably enhance network performance under typical scenarios. This study provides important insights for optimizing resource allocation in large-scale wireless networks, emphasizing the need to balance queue length and transmission success probability for better efficiency."

In order to resolve this problem, we put forward a prescribed performance control approach. It ensures DP with predefined speed and precision, meaning that DP errors remain confined within the specified performance bounds even in the presence of nonsymmetric dead-zone input. It is naturally resilient to unknown vessel dynamics and marine disturbances. Moreover, the proposed control preserves the simplicity of the controller, without identification, approximation, estimation, or derivation. At last, a simulation study is given to demonstrate the aforementioned theoretical finding."

    "abstract": "In recent years, evolutionary transfer optimization has attracted extensive attention due to its capability to enhance the optimization efficiency of expensive optimization problems (EOPs) and reduce the number of expensive function evaluations (FEs). However, most existing studies primarily focus on transferring elite individual knowledge from source tasks, while paying less attention to other aspects of knowledge such as landscape knowledge. In view of the above, this paper proposes a novel evolutionary sequential transfer optimization framework (ESTOF) for addressing EOPs. First, farthest point sampling (FPS) is utilized to filter out the data in each source task that best reflects landscape information. Subsequently, to maximize the integration of source task information, a source task screening mechanism (STSM) is designed to screen out source tasks with the highest feature similarity and data transferability to the target task. Finally, the selected source task data and target task data are used to construct a dual-task transfer gaussian process (DTGP), thereby significantly reducing the computational burden of surrogate models and the calculation of redundant parameters. Since landscape knowledge integrates both topological features and predictive information of elite individuals, ESTOF facilitates more comprehensive knowledge transfer. Experimental results further confirm that ESTOF significantly improves the optimization efficiency of EOPs while reducing the number of expensive FEs."

Building on our previous work with the Drone Rider simulator, this study investigates how four types of wind feedback—no wind, constant wind, naturally fluctuating wind, and velocity-adaptive wind— affect the VR flight experience. Seven participants experienced all conditions and rated four aspects: sense of flight, sense of being on a flying drone, sense of control, and wind naturalness. Within-participant analysis revealed that velocity-adaptive wind significantly enhanced the sense of flight and wind naturalness compared to no-wind or constant wind conditions. These findings suggest that both the presence of wind and its dynamic modulation are critical for achieving realistic and immersive VR flight experiences."

This paper addresses a fundamental bottleneck of blockchain; the simulation of consensus algorithms. State-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithm simulators are built on general data that do not consider resource-constrained devices. These simulators have limitations in performance measurement (energy, latency, and throughput) and testing of security attacks, including DoS, Sybil, and 34% or 51% attacks). This paper introduces a blockchain Internet of Things consensus algorithm (BICA) simulator, which offers a framework for testing consensus algorithms with adaptable IoT data in various attack scenarios. It evaluates metrics such as latency, throughput, and attack resilience, providing insights into their capabilities under diverse network conditions. A case study involving Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Proof of Elapse Time (PoET), Proof of Authority (PoA) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) showed PBFT’s superior performance and security against vulnerabilities such as Sybil, DoS, and 34-51% attacks.

Our contribution is to demonstrate that graph theory offers a promising approach to addressing energy-efficiency challenges in VCDNs. We aim to show how previous VCDN network can be enhanced using graph theory. This study also evaluates the effectiveness of graph-based analysis for optimizing the placement of origin servers and edge servers (surrogates). In our research, we compare the traditional random placement of servers with an approach driven by network analysis. Our findings reveal that applying graph theory can lead to significant improvements in energy consumption. These results are valuable both for addressing energy challenges during the deployment phase and for optimizing energy efficiency in existing VCDN networks."

A total of 20 paired measurements were collected under similar arc current and duration conditions, with IE values ranging from 0.91 to 1.02 cal/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>. These values were compared to estimates obtained from the IEEE Std 1584-2018 model. Statistical analysis included a paired t-test and the two one-sided tests (TOST), which assess statistical equivalence within predefined acceptance margins. The observed differences remained within acceptable limits, suggesting consistent behavior between thermographic measurements and standard-based estimations. Additional exploratory analysis was conducted to examine distribution characteristics and support interpretation. While not intended to replace conventional instrumentation, the thermographic approach demonstrated feasibility as a complementary method for IE estimation. Broader studies under diverse conditions are recommended to further evaluate its applicability."

Results indicate that PPO-XGB offers the best predictive performance in respect of all accuracy metrics: root-mean-squared-error (RMSE), mean-absolute-error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>).In addition,a hybridization of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and PPO-XGB is implemented to find the optimal solutions for machining parameters. It balances the multi-objective conflict of minimizing Ra and cutting force. Experiments demonstrate: PPO-XGB’s predictive performance (test set RMSE=0.2000 for Ra, 0.0153 for Force) significantly outperforms baseline models; two Pareto solutions optimized by NSGA-II reduce Ra by 12.7% and cutting force by 9.3% compared to empirical solution.

Using a publicly available dataset of adults aged ≥ 70 years who completed continuous walking task, sagittal-plane acceleration and angular-velocity waveforms for every stride were summarized by Dynamic Time Warping distances and partitioned with K-medoids++ clustering. A four-cluster solution optimally balanced compactness and separation, yielding: (0) high-cadence, (1) cautious, (2) intermediate, and (3) robust patterns. Fall prevalence ranged from 27 % in Cluster 3 to 68 % in Cluster 1. Within each cluster, fallers still displayed slower speed, shorter steps, and poorer functional scores than non-fallers despite otherwise similar global gait signatures; for example, Cluster 3 fallers walked 31 % slower and covered roughly half the distance of their non-falling counterparts. Fear of falling and clinical measures discriminated against fallers only in phenotypes characterized by faster gait velocity, suggesting phenotype-specific risk mechanisms. The findings highlight that gait phenotyping sharpens clinical stratification beyond binary faller/non-faller labels and that preventive thresholds for metrics such as gait velocity should be calibrated based on phenotype."

This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power. These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa."

In current implementations, this protection is deactivated once the AR terminates—such as during maintenance or controller failures—leaving devices vulnerable to unauthorized configuration changes. To close this gap, we propose a lightweight and backward-compatible extension that enables persistent DCP Read-only protection independent of AR state. The proposed mechanism stores the protection flag in non-volatile memory and supports secure activation or deactivation via standard engineering tools. We implement and validate our solution using the Siemens PROFINET Driver and SIMATIC S7-1500 hardware. Experimental results show that our enhancement reliably blocks unauthorized DCP modifications, even after AR loss—thus significantly improving the configuration security of mission-critical industrial networks."

The proposed DRL based method is shown to outperform traditional approaches—including Volterra series, look-up tables, and machine learning-based indirect learning algorithms—in terms of bit-error rate (BER) and effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement. Additionally, the study demonstrates the superior robustness of DRL compared to direct learning architectures (DLA) under abrupt input power variations in power amplifiers. Notably, this work is the first to incorporate transfer learning into the DRL training process, effectively stabilizing performance across varying operating conditions."

    "abstract": "As a pivotal technique for enhancing the interpretability of images degraded by poor visibility, image dehazing is indispensable for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of various visual systems, particularly in the domains of autonomous driving, video surveillance, and remote sensing. Addressing this issues of blurred images, loss of details, and insufficient brightness in current defogging models during nonuniform defogging processes, this study proposes a defogging network, which combines dual attention and discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT). First, a 2D-DWT defogging network is introduced into the model structure, which retains more highfrequency information and significantly improves the restoration of details and textures; Second, a histogram self-attention mechanism is incorporated into the 2D-DWT defogging network to effectively focus on dynamic range spatial features, thereby achieving global efficient defogging; Finally, a half wavelet attention block is introduced into the transfer learning-based defogging branch to further enrich the feature representation in the image wavelet domain. To validate the model's effectiveness, we constructed a dataset closely resembling real-world scenarios by integrating multiple databases and conducted comparative experiments with state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the exceptional effectiveness of the proposed framework, which excels in producing high-quality, haze-free images. This study provides new research insights for de-hazing technology and holds significant theoretical and practical value for unsupervised model-based dehazing."

Although tracking data is commonly used for prediction in existing methods, it is derived from a bird’s-eye view and fails to consider the passer’s perceptual cues. We tackle this problem with the passer’s body orientation, which is estimated from the broadcast image. Specifically, we construct a player graph that reflects the spatial relationships among players and adapt its structure according to the body orientation of the passer. The proposed method then predicts pass receivers by applying a graph attention network to the player graph. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method."

This work introduces a wake-up receiver and wake-up signaling to both policies to improve the energy efficiency of the sensor nodes. The decentralized policy designed with random access prioritizes transmissions of instantaneous observations that are highly likely to contribute to the improvement of state estimation. Our numerical results show that the decentralized policy improves the accuracy of the estimation in comparison to the oblivious policy under the constraint on the radio resource and consumed energy when the correlation between the processes observed by the sensor nodes is low. We also clarify the degree of correlation in which the superiority of two policies changes."

In this study, we collected subjective intelligibility ratings for speech produced by DHH individuals with varying articulatory abilities.

    "abstract": "Current-carrying compression connections, among other applications widely used to join transmission line conductors, are important components that fulfill crucial functions in an overhead line. In practical application, electric-thermal, mechanical and ambient loads act on the connections and influence their long-term behavior depending on the initial joint resistance. Recently, thermal irregularities of current-carrying connections are increasingly diagnosed especially for high-utilized overhead lines. In particular, the interaction of relevant aging mechanisms and deterioration mechanisms that accelerate reaching the end of lifetime is still not fully understood. In order to determine factors that can limit the service life of compression connections, long-term tests for several thousand hours were carried out under realistic outdoor operating conditions. Electric-thermal and mechanical loads were therefore applied to the tested connections. The resistance behavior and the thermal operating behavior of typical compression fittings were evaluated. It was found that mechanical tensile loads can deteriorate compression connections, especially if they were made with service-aged transmission line conductors. Connections made with the same connectors and brand-new conductors were not affected. Hence, the paper summarizes the results and the found correlations for unstable thermal operating behavior of compression connections and presents some recommendations for practice, diagnosing and testing."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the superiority of graph neural networks (GNNs) in the aspect of relational modeling has been confirmed in rotating machinery fault diagnosis field. However, most GNNs based intelligent diagnostic methods struggle to construct high-precision and low-complexity graph and perform poorly without efficient graph update strategies. To solve these problems, a semisupervised high-order graph diffusion network (SHGDN) for cross domain fault diagnosis is proposed in this study. First, the discriminative subsequences called Shapelets are sufficiently extracted by diffusion model. Thereafter, fast dynamic time warping and sparse strategy are leveraged to construct dynamic graph with semantic perception ability. Second, a high-order graph diffusion network based on approximate personalized propagation of neural predictions is put forward, which can implement dual-stream aggregation modeling for local first-order neighbors and global high-order neighbors. Then, the pseudolabel guided dynamic graph optimization and Leiden algorithm-based subgraph exchange enhancement is developed to reduce the cumulative propagation of pseudolabel errors. Finally, the explicit theoretical connection between graph construction and graph update is established, which can break the limitation of parameter isolation and provide a unified framework for model optimization. The proposed method is demonstrated on datasets from three types, and the experimental results indicate the SHGDN achieves the average accuracy of 97.29<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Thermal imaging offers valuable properties, but suffers from inherently low spatial resolution, which can be enhanced using a high-resolution (HR) visible image as guidance. However, the substantial modality differences between thermal and visible images, coupled with significant resolution gaps, pose challenges to existing guided super-resolution (SR) approaches. In this article, we present dual-conditional diffusion (DuaDiff), an innovative diffusion model featuring a dual-conditioning mechanism to enhance guided thermal image SR. Unlike typical conditional diffusion models, DuaDiff integrates a learnable Laplacian pyramid to extract high-frequency details from the visible image, serving as one of the conditioning inputs. By capturing multiscale high-frequency components, DuaDiff effectively focuses on intricate textures and edges in the HR visible images, significantly enhancing thermal image fidelity. Furthermore, we project both thermal and visible images into a semantic latent space, constructing another conditioning input. Leveraging these complementary conditions, DuaDiff employs a multimodal latent feature cross-attention module to facilitate effective interaction between noise, thermal, and visible latent representations. Extensive experiments on the FLIR-ADAS and CATS datasets for <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$8\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> guided SR demonstrate that combining learnable Laplacian conditioning with semantic latent conditioning enables DuaDiff to surpass state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and metric evaluation, particularly in scenarios with a large resolution gap.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has heightened hardware security concerns, particularly with the emergence of hardware Trojans (HTs) as malicious components in integrated circuits. These HTs pose significant threats to information privacy and system performance. The early detection methods rely on golden references and domain knowledge, limiting their implementation in large-scale integrated circuits. Traditional machine learning-based HT detections can effectively identify infected circuits without golden chips. However, locating and evaluating the specific behavior of HTs in vast and complex circuits is challenging. To address these challenges, this paper presents an HT Object Detection (HTOD) problem, which involves two primary tasks: identifying the boundaries and sizes of HTs within circuits and distinguishing between different HT behaviors. We have developed a two-stage HT object detection framework based on a bidirectional jumping knowledge network called HTOD-BGNN to solve the HTOD problem, which enables progressive refinement of localized regions. It incorporates enhanced base-type features to ensure scalability and information retention during modeling. Additionally, the implementation of sample augmentation alleviates the challenges of sample imbalance and scarcity. The proposed method enables more intelligent circuit detection, achieving 100% and 87.5% detection rates for Trojan triggering and payload behaviors, respectively. It demonstrates superior localization performance and effective generalization to unseen circuit scenarios via its region refinement mechanism, achieving F1-scores of 54.01% on TrustHub and 90.04% on TRIT datasets."

    "abstract": "Due to the complexity of data collection in the real world, Multi-view Representation Learning (MvRL) always encounters the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">incomplete information</i> challenge, typically manifested as the Sample-missing Problem (SP) and the View-unaligned Problem (VP). Although several methods have been proposed, they fail to find a good trade-off among sample restoration, view alignment, and data diversity preservation. To address this issue, we take and mathematically formulate two sociological concepts for MvRL, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">community commonality</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">community versatility</i>, where the former refers to the identical custom shared within the same community, and the latter refers to the similar but non-identical custom within communities of the same minority. One could find that the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">community commonality</i> can enhance the compactness of view-specific clusters, and the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">community versatility</i> can preserve the view diversity. Moreover, combining both of them could facilitate achieving robust MvRL with incomplete information. With the formulations, we propose a novel method dubbed Community-Aware Multi-viEw RepresentAtion learning with incomplete information (CAMERA). In brief, CAMERA employs a novel dual-stream network and an elaborate objective function that theoretically and empirically embraces community commonality and versatility. Extensive experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate that CAMERA remarkably outperforms 24 competitive multi-view learning methods on clustering, classification, and human action recognition tasks."

    "abstract": "The widely adopted extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) wideband systems are fundamentally constrained by their two-dimensional planar coverage, primarily due to the conventional use of uniform linear arrays (ULAs). This limitation significantly degrades the quality of service in practical three-dimensional (3D) deployment scenarios. Furthermore, XL-MIMO wideband systems inherently suffer from severe beam squint effects caused by non-negligible signal propagation delays, and the narrow beamwidth results in substantial beam training overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cost-efficient frequency-dependent beamforming framework capable of supporting 3D spatially distributed users by leveraging a full-dimensional uniform planar array (UPA) architecture. Based on this design, we introduce a controllable 3D beam squint scheme via a partially-connected time-delay network, alongside a low-dimensional user-centric spatial-frequency scanning codebook to enable rapid and robust beam training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves accurate 3D angle estimation with significantly reduced training overhead during the initial access phase. Additionally, the proposed method can maintain high angle estimation accuracy in poor channel conditions."

The principle is to interface H264 with the 5G QoS to construct measurable objective functions in terms of the latency and in terms of the rendering quality that reflect the requirements of an end-user using the said multi-agent system. Once the optimization problem is built, we make it a linear optimization problem that allows for many solvers, e.g., the simplex algorithm.

Despite advancements, rejection rates of current prosthetic hands remain high, emphasizing the need for prosthetic hands that better meet user requirements. We aim to develop an electric prosthesis suitable for long-term use and resistant to factors, such as perspiration. This design will depend on muscle vibrations (MVs) measured using a piezoelectric wire sensor, which is easy to install, non-invasive, lightweight, and robust. Previously, we classified six movements using MVs, achieving an average classification accuracy exceeded 90%. However, the model required 35 training datasets and 1000 ms of data length, rendering data collection time-consuming and reducing responsiveness. Reducing training datasets and shortening the data length led to a significant drop in average motion classification accuracy, falling below 65%. To address this, we applied Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) for feature selection method, improving motion classification accuracy under reduced datasets and shorter data lengths. With two training datasets and a data length of 300 ms, the average motion classification accuracy reached 87.4%. Furthermore, we optimized model parameters to improve the minimum classification accuracy. This approach reduces data collection demands and improves the responsiveness of motion classification using MVs."

Experiments show that our method maintains competitive rendering and segmentation performance while greatly reducing computational complexity."

It comprises two components: the Perception Agent (PA), which semantically interprets multimodal input – including imagery, audio, and telemetry data – from UAV-mounted sensors to derive Service Level Specifications (SLSs); and the Decision-and-Action Agent (DAA), which reconfigures the network based on inferred intents. A4FN embodies key properties of Agentic AI, including autonomy, goal-driven reasoning, and continuous perception-action cycles. Designed for mission-critical, infrastructure-limited scenarios such as disaster response, it supports adaptive reconfiguration, dynamic resource management, and interoperability with emerging wireless technologies.

    "abstract": "Dense collections of movable objects are common in everyday spaces-from cabinets in a home to shelves in a warehouse. Safely retracting objects from such collections is difficult for robots, yet people do it frequently, leveraging learned experience in tandem with vision and non-prehensile tactile sensing on the sides and backs of their hands and arms. We investigate the role of contact force sensing for training robots to gently reach into constrained clutter and extract objects. The available sensing modalities are (1) “eye-in-hand” vision, (2) proprioception, (3) non-prehensile triaxial tactile sensing, (4) contact wrenches estimated from joint torques, and (5) a measure of object acquisition obtained by monitoring the vacuum line of a suction cup. We use imitation learning to train policies from a set of demonstrations on randomly generated scenes, then conduct an ablation study of wrench and tactile information. We evaluate each policy's performance across 40 unseen environment configurations. Policies employing any force sensing show fewer excessive force failures, an increased overall success rate, and faster completion times. The best performance is achieved using both tactile and wrench information, producing an 80% improvement above the baseline without force information."

    "abstract": "Collaborative machine learning has been a key technology to enhance the development of intelligent transportation systems with the advantage of privacy protection and communication efficiency. However, model training on vehicles requires a large amount of computation resource especially that the machine learning (ML) models are massive nowadays. In this paper, we shed light on the situation that a part of the vehicles may have low computational capability and not able to participate in the training process. To address this problem, we propose a Vehicular Edge Hybrid Federated Split Learning (VEHFSL) paradigm considering the data privacy protection and resource constraints in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Firstly, we select the vehicles to participate in the training process by sorting the weighted sum of the expected sojourn time and training data volume of each vehicle. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the training latency of one round by jointly optimizing the training mode selection, computation frequency and transmit power allocation. Given that the formulated optimization problem is mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), which is typically NP-hard, we design a joint mode selection and resource allocation algorithm (JMSRA) by performing block coordinate descent (BCD) technique to decompose it into three sub-problems and iteratively solving them to achieve a near-optimal solution efficiently with the balance of the computational complexity and optimality of the solution. Finally, extensive simulations are performed to validate the superiority of our proposed VEHFSL paradigm in resource-constrained vehicular networks."

However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for nonstationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETG-PSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive non-stationary implicit process prior that can capture complex transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy."

As wind and solar energy adoption increases, precise estimation of voltage stability margins becomes increasingly crucial. This paper proposes a novel approach to predict voltage stability margins (VSM) in wind and solar-integrated real-time practical grid systems using a cascaded neural network (CNN), one of the machine learning (ML) models. The CNN method provides a computationally less complex NN model with the required accuracy to predict the VSM under diverse operating conditions in renewable-rich systems, which forms a major contribution of the paper. The performance of the CNN is compared against a Multilayer feedforward neural network and other ML techniques, with testing conducted on the Indian utility's 62-bus system. The proposed method offers an effective operational tool for system operators to monitor and maintain voltage stability in environments with high renewable energy penetration."

This structure can be described by means of a capacitor (that accounts for the electric coupling between the line and the CSRR) series-connected to a grounded parallel resonator (modeling the CSRR) with a capacitance that depends on the dielectric constant of the so-called material under test (MUT), or analyte. The structure exhibits a resonance and an antiresonance frequency. Since the phase of the reflection coefficient, the output variable, should experience a variation of 180° between such frequencies, by designing the sensor with closely spaced resonance and antiresonance frequencies, the derivative of the phase with frequency is expected to be very high between such frequencies, a sufficient condition to boost the sensitivity. In this work, it is shown that the relative separation between the resonance and antiresonance frequencies can be mechanically controlled, thereby providing an approach for sensitivity tuning. Validation is carried out by considering both nontunable and mechanically reconfigurable sensors.

To coordinate the compression across the sensors and ensure efficient DT updating globally, we formulate the problem as a Stackelberg game, where the BS acts as the leader for allocating communication/computing resources, while the sensors act as followers to optimize their data compression. By deriving each sensor’s best response (BR), we further propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium. Simulation results show that incorporating data compression significantly reduces DT synchronization time. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, closely matching the centralized joint optimization scheme with almost no price of anarchy."

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health condition worldwide, with substantial occupational and economic consequences. Conventional self-report instruments such as State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) provide only static, subjective snapshots, limiting their value for continuous monitoring. Physiological sensing offers an objective alternative, as anxiety induces measurable changes in autonomic and central nervous system activity, including altered heart rate variability (HRV), elevated electrodermal activity (EDA), irregular respiration, and cortical activation patterns detectable through electroencephalography (EEG). Advances in wearable sensors and machine learning have enabled real-time acquisition and modeling of these signals, with promising results for automated anxiety detection. This review synthesizes 51 studies published between 2010 and 2025, mapping the methodological pipeline from labeling and biomarker selection to modeling and validation. EDA and HRV were the most consistently associated biomarkers, while multimodal fusion generally outperformed unimodal approaches. Support vector machines and random forests dominated early work; more recent studies explored deep neural networks, which show potential but face challenges of data scarcity, interpretability, and generalizability. Despite technical advances, translation to real-world occupational settings remains limited. The field is constrained by heterogeneous labeling, frequent stress–anxiety conflation, reliance on student populations, and minimal workplace validation. Future research must prioritize ecologically valid data collection, standardized labeling, and rigorous cross-context evaluation to develop practical anxiety detection systems."

We adopt a user-centric approach for communication user equipments (UEs) and a distributed sensing approach for multi-target detection. A heuristic access point (AP) mode selection algorithm and a channel-aware distributed sensing scheme are proposed, where local measurements at receive APs (RX-APs) are weighted based on the received signal’s signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). A maximum a posteriori ratio test (MAPRT) detector is applied under two awareness levels at RX-APs. To balance the communication-sensing trade-off, we develop a power allocation algorithm to jointly maximize the minimum detection probability and communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while satisfying power constraints. The proposed scheme outperforms non-weighted methods. Adding test statistics from more RX-APs can degrade sensing performance due to weaker channels, but this effect can be mitigated by optimizing the weighting exponent. Additionally, assigning more sensing RX-APs to a sensing area results in approximately 10dB loss in minimum communication SINR due to limited communication resources."

However, due to the instability of heterogeneous communication and time-varying characteristics of SAGIN, it is challenging to meet the remote Internet of Things (IoT) demands for data collection and offloading. In this paper, we investigate a two-phase hierarchical data uplink model in SAGIN. Specifically, UAVs optimize trajectories to enable efficient data collection from IoT devices, and then they transmit the data to LEO satellites with computing capabilities for further processing. The problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption for IoT devices, UAVs, and LEO satellites. Since the problem is in the form of mixed-integer nonlinear programming and intractable to solve directly, we decompose it into two phases. In the IoT-UAV phase, we design the algorithm to jointly optimize the IoT pairing, power allocation, and UAVs trajectories. Considering the high dynamic characteristics of LEO satellites, a real-time LEO satellite selection mechanism joint with the Satellite Tool Kit is proposed in the UAV-LEO phase. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with about 10% less energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithm."

    "abstract": "Automatic face recognition systems are widely used in different applications which require authentication. Among various types of attacks against face recognition systems, morphing attacks have become a major concern, where face images of two subjects are combined into a face morph image which is submitted for enrolment. In a successful attack, both contributing subjects can then authenticate against the morph reference. In this work, we propose a new method to generate face morphs based on inversion of the optimal morph embeddings. To this end, we first find the optimal morph embeddings using the face embeddings of two source face images and then use state-of-the-art template inversion techniques to generate the morph. We use three different template inversion methods: the first one exploits a fully self-contained embedding-to-image inversion model, while the second and third leverage the realistic image generation of a pretrained StyleGAN network and a foundation model based on diffusion models, respectively. Furthermore, we use optimization methods to improve the performance of template inversion methods in the generation of face morph images from optimal morph embeddings. In our experiments, we evaluate the performance of generated face morph images and compare them with state-of-the-art morph generation methods, showing the superiority of our method. We showcase that our method can outperform state-of-the-art deep-learning-based morph generation methods, both in white-box and black-box attack scenarios, and compete with state-of-the-art landmark-based morph generation methods. Moreover, we perform a practical print-scan attack to simulate a real-world scenario and compare our method with previous methods in the literature, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. The source code of our proposed method and all experiments are publicly available."

    "abstract": "The accidental release of chemicals poses significant risks to human life and property, requiring rapid and accurate source seeking. Chemicals released from an intermittent indoor source form narrow, dynamic, and discrete concentration patches, leaving robots with intermittent cues and posing challenges for source seeking. This study proposed an adaptive robot search algorithm that balances exploitation of historical data and exploration of unknown areas. The proposed exploitation strategy utilizes historical data to probabilistically estimate the source location, aiming to guide the robot upstream for faster source localization. The proposed exploration strategy directs the robot to unknown areas, aiming to gather more information by prioritizing points with the highest information gain based on frontier evaluation. A novel time-dependent factor reduces repeated visits to early regions while mitigating exploration bias in later search stages, enabling a dynamic balance between the two strategies when selecting navigation goals. The algorithm was tested in simulated environments with varying airflow speeds, source release cycles, source release duty cycles, and different scenarios. The results demonstrated reliable and excellent performance. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was further validated in real-world robot experiments."

While three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction offers comprehensive impedance information of the lungs over two-dimensional (2D) reconstruction, it faces challenges from increased unknown conductivity parameters, domain expansion and severe ill-posedness of the inverse problem. To address these, we propose Physics-Guided Diffusion Reconstruction (PGDR), a novel framework integrating generative diffusion models with physical constraint. PGDR leverages diffusion models to learn 3D conductivity priors and incorporates voltage measurements into the sampling process for consistency with both voltage measurements and predictions. We employ score-based diffusion models (SDM) and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) with PGDR, comparing against Graz consensus (GREIT), Tikhonov and U²-Net algorithms via simulations and phantom experiments.

    "abstract": "In cloud radio access networks (C-RANs), the efficient mapping of remote radio units (RRUs) to baseband units (BBUs) presents persistent challenges, especially in large-scale deployments. These challenges are amplified by the dynamic nature of network loads and the frequency of handoff operations, necessitating solutions that can adapt swiftly to changing conditions. This research introduces an innovative approach to address these challenges through optimized RRU-BBU assignments that balance performance requirements with computational efficiency.In this paper, weighted adaptive load and handoff equilibrium (WHALE) framework, a novel optimization approach that simultaneously addresses handoff optimization and load balancing is proposed. Our prediction framework leverages a hybrid architecture combining long short-term memory (LSTM) networks with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to achieve robust RRU load forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness across different scales of deployment. In moderate-scale environments, WHALE significantly outperforms conventional approaches, capturing a substantial proportion of potential handoff transitions while achieving marked reductions in execution time. When scaled to larger deployments, the framework demonstrates substantial improvements in computational efficiency, with execution times reduced by nearly an order of magnitude while maintaining performance parity with genetic algorithm (GA) implementations. The prediction-enhanced variant (WHALE-P) exhibits superior efficiency in handoff optimization performance while demonstrating enhanced load balancing capabilities compared to GA implementations, achieving better solution quality with significantly reduced computational overhead."

In this paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To reduce the computational cost, selection is performed based on intermediate outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses a single random seed without selection, across multiple evaluation metrics."

Traditional binary classifications of conscious ness and unconsciousness may fail to capture the gradual and variable transitions that occur during the induction and emergencephasesofanesthesia. These transitions can differ significantly across individuals and anesthetic agents. This study aims to classify three conscious states, such as consciousness, transitions, and unresponsiveness under sedation with propofol and midazolam, based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Using patient-controlled sedation paradigms, we identified transitions through be havioral responsiveness and proposeanoveldeeplearning framework, Deep-ConTrans, incorporating common spatial pattern-based spatial filtering, multi-domain feature extrac tion, attention-based fusion, and domain-adversarial training for robust classification. The average classification accuracies were improved, achieving 93.93 (±3.32)% for propofol and 97.42 (±1.68)% for midazolam, respectively, demonstrating superior performance over conventional methods. The model also demonstrated strong cross anesthetic generalizability, maintaining high performance when evaluated across propofol and midazolam in external validation. Specifically, transitions toward unresponsive ness were marked by increased delta power in frontal regions and increased alpha power in parietal regions. These spectral changes are consistent with cortical bistability and disruption in the posterior hot zone, both of which have been linked to alterations in consciousness. By identifying robust and drug-independent EEG signatures of transitions, this study highlights the potential for more granular and reliable intraoperative monitoring beyond binary assessment. The enhanced generalizability and sensitivity of Deep-ConTrans enable anesthesiologists to precisely identify critical transitions, thus improving anesthetic man agement, minimizing the risk of intraoperative awareness, and facilitating personalized sedation protocols based on real-time EEG dynamics."

The proposed mechanism updates the incentives on a slower timescale compared to the players' learning dynamics, resulting in a two-timescale coupled dynamical system. Notably, this mechanism is agnostic to the specific learning dynamics used by players to update their strategies. We show that any fixed point of this adaptive incentive mechanism corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism, ensuring that the Nash equilibrium coincides with the socially optimal strategy. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions under which the adaptive mechanism converges to a fixed point. Our results apply to both atomic and non-atomic games. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism, we verify the convergence conditions in two practically relevant classes of games: atomic aggregative games and non-atomic routing games."

    "abstract": "In long-memory tasks, real-world and industrial time-series data, such as sunspot sequences, typically exhibit complex intertemporal dependencies. Traditional time-delay reservoir (TDR) computing models perform well on short-term sequences but struggle with long-term dependencies, resulting in degraded prediction performance, particularly with isomorphic models and shallow connections. Inspired by the node construction approach of TDR based on the Mackey–Glass equation, a deep decoupled heterogeneous delayed reservoir computing model based on 2-D discrete memristor hyperchaotic maps (DMHM-DHDDR) is proposed. This model replaces time-delay differential equations in TDR with discrete memristor (DM) nonlinear dynamics and maps three types of 2-D discrete memristor systems [sine-coupled absolute value DM (sA-DM), sine-coupled sinusoidal value DM (sS-DM), and sine-coupled exponential value DM (sE-DM)] to different layers. By integrating the masked input and cross-layer state transition mechanisms, the reservoir exhibits significantly enhanced capability in extracting temporal features and improving prediction accuracy, while the model demonstrates relatively low parameter sensitivity without substantially increasing memory overhead. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the DMHM-DHDDR model achieves a notable reduction in normalized root-mean-square error compared with traditional reservoir computing models on both chaotic sequence and real-world prediction tasks. Furthermore, this work, for the first time, employs fractal dimension analysis and phase-space reconstruction to evaluate reservoir states. The results confirm that reservoirs driven by hyperchaotic mappings exhibit predictive behaviors comparable to those of conventional reservoirs. This provides theoretical support for applying discrete memristor-based mappings in reservoir computing."

    "abstract": "To address the challenge of cross-region feature distribution shifts in corrosion damage monitoring using ultrasonic guided wave, this study proposes a transfer learning method based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Representation Subspace Distance (CNN-RSD). This method aims to improve damage localization accuracy and generalization capability of guided wave signals across diverse structures. This approach extracts damage-sensitive features from Lamb wave in various structures, providing a foundation for subsequent domain adaptation regression. Simultaneously, RSD is introduced as the domain-adaptive regression module to minimize the geometric distance between source and target feature subspaces from a subspace alignment perspective, which effectively mitigating the regression performance degradation caused by scale perturbation in traditional feature alignment method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a corrosion damage dataset based on aluminum plate was constructed, and multiple transfer experiments were designed. Damage data corresponding to a 20 mm defect from aluminum plate sample 1 were used as the source domain, and cross-domain recognition tests were subsequently conducted on aluminum plate sample 2 with four different damage sizes (15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, and 30 mm). Furthermore, additional validation was performed on two new aluminum plates containing real corrosion defects. The results demonstrate that the CNN-RSD method outperforms comparative models, including 1D-CNN, CNN-KGW, and gMLP, in terms of mean absolute error and localization relative error, exhibiting superior positioning accuracy and robustness. It also maintains robust positioning performance in real-damage verification, thereby highlighting its cross-domain transferability and potential for engineering applications."

    "abstract": "To reconcile the inherent trade-off between high sensitivity and wide sensing range, a flexible resistive pressure sensor fabricated via a flash-foam stamp-assisted process is presented. The device is composed of a PVA-based conductive hydrogel layer with conical microstructures and screen-printed laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes produced by direct laser writing on polyimide (PI). Precise microstructure replication is enabled by this low-cost, scalable method without the need for cleanroom lithography. A sensitivity of 0.2413 kPa⁻¹ over 0–3 kPa is achieved by the sensor, along with a wide detection range of 0–66 kPa, rapid response/recovery times of 0.1s, low hysteresis of 1.16%, and stable operation over more than 2000 cycles. Physiological signals such as pulse, subtle motions, and large joint movements (knee, elbow) are reliably captured. Multipoint recognition is demonstrated through a 3×3 pressure-sensing array. These results highlight the potential of LIG pressure sensors incorporating flash-foam-fabricated PVA-based conical microstructures for applications in wearable health monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and soft robotics."

However, the majority of these models are constrained to process low-resolution images, which limits their effectiveness in perception tasks that necessitate detailed visual information. In our study, we present MG-LLaVA, an innovative MLLM that enhances the model’s visual processing capabilities by incorporating a multi-granularity vision flow, which includes low-resolution, high-resolution, and object-centric features. We propose the integration of an additional high-resolution visual encoder to capture fine-grained details, which are then fused with base visual features through a Conv-Gate fusion network. To further refine the model’s object recognition abilities, we incorporate object-level features derived from bounding boxes identified by offline detectors. Being trained solely on publicly available multimodal data through instruction tuning, MG-LLaVA demonstrates exceptional perception skills. We instantiate MG-LLaVA with a wide variety of language encoders, ranging from 3.8B to 34B, to evaluate the model’s performance comprehensively. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MG-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLMs of comparable parameter sizes, showcasing its remarkable efficacy."

Traditional classification methods, such as manual inspection and spectrometry, are inefficient and prone to errors. To address this issue, the current study focused on developing an AI-driven system that employs the MobileNetV2 model optimized through a genetic algorithm (GA). Specifically, an attention-enhanced MobileNetV2 architecture was utilized, incorporating 90 frozen layers, dual attention modules, and a dropout rate of 0.254. The results showed a perfect (100%) classification accuracy achieved on a dataset of 2,483 egg images across three classes: brown, platform, and white. The research highlights the significant impact of architectural components such as second dense layers and attention mechanisms on classification performance. This approach offers a robust framework for precise eggshell color classification that can be adapted for quality assessment in poultry production and genetic research applications."

    "abstract": "With the advent of quantum computing, the increasing threats to security poses a great challenge to communication networks. Recent innovations in this field resulted in promising technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which enables the generation of unconditionally secure keys, establishing secure communications between remote nodes. Additionally, QKD networks enable the interconnection of multi-node architectures, extending the point-to-point nature of QKD. However, due to the limitations of the current state of technology, the scalability of QKD networks remains a challenge toward feasible implementations. When it comes to long-distance implementations, trusted relay nodes partially solve the distance issue through the forwarding of the distributed keys, allowing applications that do not have a direct QKD link to securely share key material. Even though the relay procedure itself has been extensively studied, the establishment of the relaying node path still lacks a solution. This paper proposes an innovative network architecture that solves the challenges of Key Management System (KMS) identification, relay path discovery, and scalability of QKD networks by integrating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles, and establishing high-level virtual KMSs (vKMS) in each node and creating a new entity called the Quantum Security Controller (QuSeC). The vKMS serves the end-user key requests, managing the multiple KMSs within the node and abstracting the user from discovering the correct KMS. Additionally, based on the high-level view of the network topology and status, the QuSeC serves the path discovery requests from vKMSs, computing the end-to-end (E2E) relay path and applying security policies. The paper also provides a security analysis of the proposal, identifying the security levels of the architecture and analyzing the core networking security properties, and a performance evaluation that confirms the feasibility and scalability of the proposal."

To address these issues, we propose a novel Transformer-based Spatial Temporal Fusion (TSTF) module integrated with an auxiliary contrastive learning task within a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The TSTF module captures interaction-aware behaviors and long-term temporal dependencies that tackle mixed cooperative driving scenarios, while the auxiliary contrastive learning task refines feature representations to enhance exploration efficiency and decision stability. Experimental evaluations on the MetaDrive platform demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline algorithms in safety, adaptability and robustness to dynamic traffic scenarios. The results highlight the effectiveness of the TSTF module in enabling robust and context-aware collaborative driving behaviors, offering a scalable solution for real-world mixed traffic. This work advances MARL by addressing key challenges in interaction modeling and driving decision-making under uncertainty, with significant implications for the development of intelligent transportation systems."

The superstructure model of multi-impurity water networks has the characteristics of nonlinearity, multi-dimensionality and multiple constraints, and traditional optimization algorithms are difficult to solve it effectively. To overcome this challenge, this paper introduces the concept of critical distance, dynamically adjusting the gravitational and repulsive forces based on the distance between particles to balance the global search and local development capabilities. And the constraint conditions are processed by dynamically adjusting the penalty function of the penalty factor to gradually approach the optimal solution that satisfies the conditions. The results of optimizing a certain benchmark water network with AAGRGSA were compared with those of other intelligent optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that AAGRGSA has better convergence characteristics and solution quality compared with other algorithms, and can find a better solution more stably."

    "abstract": "In multi-agent systems, Deep Q Network (DQN) is a basic algorithm that utilize the representational ability of deep learning and the decision-making capacity of reinforcement learning to tackle complex tasks in control and optimization problems. However, standard DQN algorithm faces challenges in generalization and robustness, especially when dealing with varying noise levels in practical environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Mutual Deep Q Networks (Mut-DQN), a multi-agent algorithm that combines mutual learning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Mut-DQN employs multiple agents with independently initialized Q networks. These agents learn mutually by minimizing a mixed loss function, which includes both Temporal Difference (TD) error and mutual loss. The mutual loss is specifically designed to reduce the variance among different agents’ actions when they encounter the same environment states. By minimizing mutual loss, the system promotes knowledge exchange between agents, enhancing the diversity and generalization of their behaviors. Our experiments demonstrate that Mut-DQN can resist parameter and environment noise compared to standard DQN significantly, meaning that the Mut-DQN can reach a wide and stable solution space. Mut-DQN’s capacity to enable information sharing among agents enhances both robustness and generalization. Such improvement is essential for multi-agent systems that interact frequently with dynamic and noisy environments."

Initially, time-domain features of pipeline acoustic emission signals are extracted using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Then, a self-supervised learning approach combined with contrastive loss is employed to enhance the model's ability to learn features from unlabeled or weakly labeled data. Finally, the CNN -extracted features are fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for small leak detection. The self -contrastive learning approach enables the model to autonomously learn pipeline leak features in the absence of labeled data. Experiments using real-world pipeline data from an industrial company demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 97.2% in detecting small leaks, outperforming traditional CNN and LSTM models by 8.3% and 6.1 %, respectively. The model exhibits strong robustness in noisy environments, providing a practical solution for real-time pipeline leak monitoring in industrial settings."

The IDE integrates key functionalities into a unified workflow, including an intuitive drag-and-drop GUI for constructing SoC architectures without manual scripting, automated gem5 installation, and performance metric visualization for postsimulation analysis. To demonstrate usability and extensibility, we applied the IDE to simulate an x86-based SoC incorporating a user-defined Processing Unit (PU).

Quantum Time Synchronization (QTS), enabled by entangled photon-based quantum networks, offers ultra-precise clock alignment across distributed nodes. However, practical deployment requires an authenticated classical communication channel to exchange timestamped data and extract synchronization offsets. This paper investigates the core tradeoffs between classical channel latency and achievable QTS precision in hybrid quantum-classical networks. Using a discrete-event simulator, we evaluate the impact of various classical network protocols, each with distinct latency characteristics, on QTS performance. Our results demonstrate that even modest latency increases result in degraded synchronization accuracy and increased synchronization jitter, particularly in time-critical industrial contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a combined approach that integrates low-overhead authentication, low-latency communication protocols, and predictive clock drift compensation. Our findings provide actionable guidance for balancing latency, security, and synchronization accuracy in QTS services for future networks."

This study investigated the effects of carbonation-induced sensory stimulation on cortical activity during swallowing. Electroencephalography signals were recorded from healthy adults during swallowing tasks under three conditions: still water, mildly carbonated water, and strongly carbonated water. Time–frequency analysis based on fast Fourier transform was employed to quantify spectral power changes relative to swallowing events. Particular focus was placed on the beta band (13–30 Hz) to evaluate cortical activation across conditions. The results revealed a significant increase in beta-band power at the Cz, C3, C4, T4, and F8 electrodes under the strong carbonation condition, suggesting activation of sensorimotor-related cortical areas. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the alpha band (8–13 Hz). These findings indicate that carbonation may enhance swallowing-related cortical neural activity, supporting the potential of carbonated water as a non-invasive tool for evaluation and training. This study provides foundational insights for the neurophysiological understanding of swallowing function and contributes to the development of objective assessment indices."

In this study GreedyBoost is compared with the already present models including linear regression, support vector machines, partial least squares and deep learning architectures such as LSTM and GRU by considering R2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE. This study’s findings, supported by the performance comparison graphs, show that GreedyBoost provides us the best combination of all the employed models and outperforms other ensemble methods, hence is feasible for cryptocurrency markets when forecasting is considered. This research is another contribution to the growing investigation of ensemble learning in financial applications and may be useful for further insight into the formation of investment strategies.

A maximum of three users in the experimental setup were found within the analyzed studies, and only in three of them body orientation was considered besides motion. Finally, a signal processing chain is proposed for scenarios with multiple moving users, and further research opportunities within each chain step are listed."

    "abstract": "Academic stress exerts measurable physiological effects that can be captured noninvasively using wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors. However, existing stress-detection methods rely heavily on supervised learning with annotated labels, which are costly to obtain and often fail to generalize to real-world academic settings. In this work, we propose a fully unsupervised diffusion-probabilistic framework for detecting stress-induced anomalies in ECG recordings. Our approach trains a score-based U-Net model exclusively on resting-state cardiac beats, learning to approximate the gradient of the log density of noisy ECG samples under a forward Itô diffusion process. At inference, we compute beat-level anomaly scores via time-integrated score residuals and employ one-class support vector machines and isolation forests to flag outliers without any stress annotations. We evaluate the pipeline on data from twenty undergraduate students during resting and mock exam sessions. Beat-level detection achieves AUCs of 0.563 (one-class SVM) and 0.521 (isolation forest), while segment-level aggregation over 30second windows improves discrimination to AUCs of 0.528 and 0.556, respectively. Subject-level shifts in mean anomaly scores (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\Delta A_{s}$</tex>) correlate significantly with self-reported stress (Escala de Estresores Académicos), confirming the framework's sensitivity to individual physiological responses. UMAP visualizations of the U-Net bottleneck features reveal a compact resting manifold distinct from stress embeddings, highlighting the model's capacity to internalize baseline morphology and detect deviations. These results validate the potential of diffusion-probabilistic score modeling for continuous, personalized stress monitoring in academic environments."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the primary cause of dementia globally. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for improving patient outcomes. This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture that integrates a Convolutional Vision Transformer with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to classify different stages of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images. Unlike prior studies, which often merge moderate and mild dementia classes, this work evaluates the model in binary, three-class (excluding the minority class), and full four-class settings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 99.36 %, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art approaches even without data balancing. These results underscore the potential of combining attention mechanisms with transformer-based architectures for enhancing automated AD diagnosis and provide a promising step toward more clinically robust solutions."

Due to its stable and uniform radiation characteristics with changeable shape, LCX cable is largely used for wireless coverage over many linear-cell environments such as shopping mall, tunnel, underground mall or walkway etc. These scenarios usually require location-aware services for many applications. We have investigated many localization methods for wireless system using the proposed bidirectional LCX. The bidirectional LCX can be used as two antennas by input the signal from both sides of the cable. We have investigated the theoretical positioning error bound (PEB) of the conventional LCX. However, for bidirectional LCX, its theoretical PEB and the advantage over conventional LCX are still unknown. This paper will analyze the PEB property and compare it with the conventional LCX usage based on the LCX channel model developed from the Geometrically-Based Single-Bounce (GBSB) model. We give a brief Fisher Information analysis for wireless system using bidirectional LCX-based localization. Then the impact of different LCX configurations on the PEB is evaluated through the Cramér-Rao lower bound."

This study examines how web-based AR and AI can be integrated to create a more engaging and user-friendly booking experience. AR enables users to visualize products and spaces in real-time, while AI personalizes the booking process by analyzing user preferences. Traditional booking platforms often depend on static images and text descriptions, which can lead to uncertainty when making decisions. By merging AI-driven personalization with real-time AR visualization, this research suggests a framework that enables users to explore accommodations, event venues, and travel destinations interactively before finalizing their reservations. Imagine being able to dive into an immersive experience straight from your web browser—no app downloads, no compatibility issues, just instant access. That’s exactly what web-based AR offers. It makes things simpler for users while opening up exciting new opportunities for businesses. Instead of static images or generic descriptions, customers can interact with lifelike previews of hotels, event spaces, or travel destinations before making a booking. AI-powered recommendation systems take personalization to the next level by learning from user preferences, past searches, and browsing habits to suggest options that genuinely match their interests. And when customers have questions or need guidance, AI-driven chatbots step in, providing real-time assistance to make the booking process smooth and hassle-free."

A ground user equipment (UE) utilizes the ephemeris data using an orbit propagator model, and combines it with its own position information to determine downlink timing offset and Doppler shift at any given time. In this work, first we analytically show that relying upon even the simplest orbit propagator model, i.e., Two Body Keplerian, the process involves huge computational complexity when applied over the entire duration that the satellite is connected to the UE. To reduce the computational overhead, we then propose to decrease the number of data points computed using the orbit propagator model. This is achieved by introducing two low-complexity interpolation methods. The first method exploits polynomial based non-linear sliding interpolation. Whereas, the second method uses a unique set of finite impulse response (FIR) polyphase filter coefficients that are computed and stored offline at the UE. We show that proposed methods reduce the computational complexity more than 8 times when compared to the baseline approach without compromising the required performance, hence, making them feasible to realize in the UE."

As a core component, magnetic levitation bearings provide a foundation for the disruptive transformation of rotating machinery by eliminating mechanical friction and integrating self-perception and control capabilities. Parallel systems theory forms the theoretical basis for the digital and intelligent transformation of magnetic levitation rotating machinery, enabling continuous improvement across its full life cycle — from design and manufacturing to testing, operation, and maintenance. In the design phase, magnetic levitation rotating machinery needs to achieve integrated modeling and digital inheritance of design experience. In the manufacturing phase, virtual simulation and quality control become key elements. In the testing phase, virtual testing technology will enhance efficiency and accuracy. In the operation and maintenance phase, predictive maintenance, intelligent optimization, and process adaptability emerge as core requirements. The digital system of magnetic levitation rotating machinery consists of physical equipment, digital devices, parallel data, and parallel control systems, with capabilities of self-perception, self-learning, self-evolution, and self-scheduling. In the future, magnetic levitation rotating machinery will gradually realize multi-level digital capabilities from basic functions to cluster intelligence, promoting the optimization and collaboration of equipment in process systems.

Tracking and understanding recent developments in mobility management is essential to support the integrated, intelligent, and ubiquitous connectivity envisioned for 6G networks. This paper delivers a 3GPP-centric review of progressive mobility enhancements from Rel-15 through Rel-20 and offers insight into the emerging roadmap for 5G-Advanced and early 6G networks. After summarizing baseline measurement procedures and event-triggered reporting, we analyze three principal handover paradigms—Baseline Handover, Conditional Handover, and the recent Lower-Layer Triggered Mobility—highlighting their respective trade-offs in signaling overhead, interruption time, and robustness. We then examine how AI/ML techniques are positioned within 3GPP to predict optimal handover parameters, adapt to dynamic radio conditions, and reduce failure rates. The paper synthesizes Rel-20 hot topics, including mobility enhancements and AI/ML-based mobility use cases, and distills key contributions from 6G standardization meetings. By aligning ongoing 3GPP efforts with performance goals, this work highlights key challenges and outlines directions for future standardization beyond Rel-20."

As 6G systems are expected to operate at higher frequencies and employ larger antenna arrays than fifth-generation (5G) systems, they can also enable more accurate sensing capabilities. To this end, the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm aims to unify the physical and radio frequency (RF) domains by introducing the sensing functionality into the communication network. However, the clutter poses a challenge, as it can significantly degrade the sensing accuracy in ISAC systems. This paper presents a novel two-dimensional root multiple signal classification (2D-rootMUSIC)-based algorithm for static background clutter suppression. Computer simulation results indicate that the proposed method effectively mitigates the strong background clutter, yields accurate parameter estimation performance, and offers a notable improvement in the signal-to-clutter-and-noise ratio (SCNR), while outperforming the prior-art benchmark methods."

However, their operation is constrained by onboard energy consumption, required for both flight and communication. Beamforming, while enhancing network performance, adds to this challenge due to its energy-intensive nature.This paper proposes a sequential and hierarchical decision-making framework for UABS operations, considering trajectory planning, dynamic beamforming, and radio resource assignment (RRA). While heuristic and optimal solutions are employed for trajectory planning and RRA respectively, the beamforming model is modeled as Markov decision process (MDP) to maximize served user demand, weighted by time-varying priorities, under strict energy constraints. Leveraging a dueling double deep q-network (3DQN) algorithm that penalizes energy budget violations, an agent policy for the beamformer is then trained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms static beamforming benchmarks and closely matches an ideal step-wise oracle, achieving a balance between energy efficiency and served user demand while adapting to dynamic V2X traffic conditions."

The original CYPHONIC adapter assumes a one-to-one mapping between a general node and an adapter, which limits scalability in real-world IoT environments where multiple devices are often colocated. To address this limitation, the proposed system extends the signaling protocol to allow the CYPHONIC cloud to configure and manage general node metadata, thereby eliminating the need for adapter-side configuration. In addition, the system introduces a structured data model to maintain the state and session information of multiple general nodes concurrently. To support parallel processing, the communication engine adopts a multithreaded design, assigning independent worker threads to handle each node’s traffic. Experimental evaluations confirm that the enhanced adapter achieves stable throughput and moderate resource usage under concurrent node communication. These enhancements significantly improve the scalability, flexibility, and practicality of CYPHONIC in heterogeneous IoT deployments without requiring modifications to the end devices."

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) presents significant challenges for power grid management, necessitating accurate forecasting of charging station loads. Accurate multi-step prediction of EV charging demand is crucial for efficient grid operation, resource allocation, and maintaining stability. However, this task is complex due to the inherent spatiotemporal dependencies of charging behavior across different locations and times, as well as the influence of external factors like dynamic electricity pricing. This paper introduces STAMP-Net (Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Multi-modal Price Integration), a novel deep learning architecture specifically designed for precise, multi-step EV charging load forecasting. STAMPNet uniquely integrates historical load data with corresponding historical price information to enhance prediction accuracy over multiple future time horizons (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{3}, 6$</tex>, and 12 steps). The model architecture employs a sequence of specialized layers, including feature embedding, 2D positional encoding to capture spatial and temporal contexts, a node-wise cross-attention mechanism to effectively fuse load and price information, a time-wise spatial self-attention layer to model inter-station dependencies, and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to capture long-range temporal patterns. Using the past 12 time steps of load and price data as input, STAMP-Net predicts future load profiles. The model's effectiveness is evaluated using standard metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its capability to accurately forecast charging loads at various future horizons. By effectively capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies and integrating multi-modal price data through tailored attention mechanisms, STAMP-Net offers a promising approach for improving the reliability and accuracy of EV charging load forecasts, contributing to more robust grid management and planning in the era of electrified transportation."

In this work, we propose the problem of distributed beamforming with varying degrees of CSI incompleteness and develop a graph neural network (GNN)-based approach, which enables transmitters to collaboratively optimize their beamforming strategies using only local and partial CSI. Our approach combines imitation learning with unsupervised learning for model training, where the former provides a warm start and the latter allows for superior performance beyond the \"expert\" strategy, while leveraging the GNN for a distributed implementation. We evaluate the proposed approach using ray tracing-based simulations in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, demonstrating that it outperforms WMMSE, particularly in environments with noisy or incomplete CSI. These results highlight the potential of our GNN-based solution for scalable, robust, and distributed beamforming strategies in future wireless networks."

    "abstract": "As a key link in power system operation and planning, the prediction accuracy of power load forecasting is directly related to the economy, security and power supply reliability of power grid operation. Aiming at the low efficiency of hyperparameter tuning of current load forecasting model, this paper proposes a hyperparameter tuning of LSTM load forecasting model based on segmented Bayesian optimization. The method takes the category of hyperparameters as the segmentation condition on the basis of LSTM model, which is divided into the first segment of network structure parameter tuning and the second segment of training parameter tuning, which mainly involves the number of neurons, Dropout ratio, initial learning rate, batch size, and L2 regularization parameter, and carries out the hyperparameter tuning comparison experiments under different dimensions. The experimental results show that the training speed of the piecewise Bayesian optimization method is shortened by 35.7<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">%</sup>, 35.3%, and 65.9% respectively compared with random search in the optimization of 3, 4, and 5-dimensional hyperparameters. Compared with the traditional Bayesian optimization method, the acceleration ratio is increased by 34.2%, 36.9%, and 61.6% respectively. However, the accuracy remains basically unchanged. When the dimension is increased from four to five, the training time of random search increases by 100.1 %, that of the traditional Bayesian optimization method increases by 72.6%, while that of the piecewise Bayesian optimization method only increases by 5%, achieving a balance between accuracy and speed in high-dimensional parameter optimization."

    "abstract": "Calculating incident energy is essential for assessing the risk to which professionals involved in the operation and maintenance of electrical installations are exposed, allowing the definition of appropriate control measures and aiming at protecting workers, preserving the environment and ensuring the operational continuity of the system. The IEEE 1584 Standard is a calculation guide globally adopted by the industry for arc-flash hazard calculations and uses an empirical model updated in 2018. It was developed based on approximately 1860 tests, covering open-air and enclosed configurations, performed with different parameters, such as: operating voltage, fault currents, fault clearing time, working distances and conductor’s gap. During the IEEE 1584 development process, incident energy measurements were performed using calorimeters such as those specified in ASTM F1959, consisting of copper discs instrumented with an inserted thermocouple wire sensor. However, thermocouple-based measurements are susceptible to electromagnetic noise, requiring mathematical signal filtering techniques that may affect accuracy. ASTM F1959 allows the use of alternative calorimeters provided they are calibrated and have a similar response to the calorimeter with a thermocouple sensor. This study proposes the use of an optical calorimeter for measuring the incident energy of electric arcs produced in a three-phase panel in IEEE 1584 VCBB configuration. The calorimeter is equipped with an optical sensor and a thermocouple for simultaneous assessment of measuring systems. The results show that calorimeters with optical sensors demonstrates key advantages as immunity to electromagnetic noise and faster response times. It was evidenced that incident energy measured is higher when compared to that measured with the thermocouple sensor. These findings suggest that the choice of sensor technology can significantly impact the calculated incident energy and, consequently, influence the specification of protective measures in electrical systems, especially given that IEEE 1584 equations are based on data derived from thermocouple measurements."

A feature of power transformers is the use of liquid insulating fluid, which has two main functions: to maintain the temperature at adequate levels for operation and to guarantee the electrical insulation of its components.The point to watch out for is that this fluid has a fire point temperature that is not very high, and in the event of some failures can cause loss of tank integrity, where an explosion or fire scenario can occur. If this type of event occurs, the consequences can be catastrophic depending on the transformer’s operating context."

To address this limitation, we propose NoisyILRMA-conv, which extends NoisyILRMA by integrating a Weighted Prediction Error dereverberation module under a unified optimization scheme. Our proposed method enables joint source extraction and dereverberation while maintaining the computational efficiency of NoisyILRMA."

The proposed structure is designed to overcome key limitations at terahertz frequencies by enhancing electric field distribution for improved interaction efficiency, simplifying fabrication through the elimination of sharp edges that cause field singularities, and reducing RF losses. Dispersion and transmission analyses confirm minimal reflection and strong energy transfer. Beam–wave interaction provides 1.155 W output power, 25.85dB gain, and 0.25% electronic efficiency when 25.7kV beam voltage and 18.2mA beam current is applied using CST Studio Suite. The close alignment between the measured S-parameters of the nano-computer numerical control (CNC)-fabricated device and the simulated performance confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed design."

The temperature rise test for switchgear is a critical step in verifying the safety and reliability of electrical equipment [1]. This test ensures safe operation: when current flows through the switchgear, heat is generated. Poor heat dissipation design or excessive contact resistance in components may lead to overheating during long-term operation, potentially causing accidents due to insulation aging, contact burnout, or short-circuit faults. Excessive temperature may also trigger partial discharge or thermal runaway, leading to cascading failures. For example, excessive temperature rise at cable joints may cause insulation breakdown, affecting the stability of the entire power distribution system [2][3][4][5]. Currently, during material procurement, China State Grid mandates temperature rise testing for low-voltage switchgear."

    "abstract": "According to the international standard ISO/IEC 17025, a calibration laboratory (CL) must take into account the change in the characteristics of the standards used to ensure the reliability of the calibration results. The CLs must monitor the stability and change in the characteristics of the standards over time, in particular the drift of their readings. Changes in these readings should be taken into account when evaluation the measurement uncertainty of during calibration. Determining the long-term drift of standards, which characterizes the change in the nominal value of a standard over time, is important for obtaining accurate and reliable results in precision measurements. The most common statistical method used to determine such drift is regression. With its help, it is possible to predict the values according to a certain time trend (drift), which can be estimated based on the regression line. The results of the evaluation of long-term drifts of precision capacitance standards using polynomial approximation are presented. Various control charts are used to monitor the long-term drift of standards in a real calibration data set. The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart can be applied to absolute data, not just relative data, as in Cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts. The EWMA chart uses an exponentially weighted moving average derived from a time series of data that has a cumulative value. All received data contributes to the result, but the contribution factor decreases when calculating the next period of the EWMA chart. Such a chart can be used to capture small deviations of average values over time, which allows you to obtain and analyze the long-term drift of standards. The results of the long-term drift assessment of capacitance standards using EWMA are shown. Accredited CLs should always include the component of the total measurement uncertainty due to standard drift in their calibration uncertainty budgets. Failure to do so may result in an underestimation of the calibration uncertainty. A procedure for predicting the future value and uncertainty during calibration, taking into account the real drift of the standard used, is proposed. Examples of predicting the of standard values taking into account the drift component of the total standard uncertainty are presented. Interpretation of the results regarding the prediction of future calibration results was carried out using special software “DDrift 1.0”, for which appropriate verification and validation were carried out. The predicted values of the standards were simulated using the Monte Carlo method for 3<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rd</sup> order polynomial regression. Those values obtained using software “DDrift v.1.0” differ slightly from the modulated data using the Monte Carlo method, but are within the established confidence interval."

    "abstract": "Wearable sensors have found numerous applications in health and wellness promotion and have achieved great success leveraging advancements in deep learning. However, the development of robust continues to be hindered by issues related to sensor noise, inconsistent sampling rates, and individual differences. Topological data analysis (TDA) has emerged as a viable solution to extract robust features from such time-series data by converting them into persistence images (PIs), which capture intrinsic characteristics and demonstrate resilience to noise and signal variations. However, the computational costs of TDA pose significant challenges for small devices with limited resources. To more efficiently incorporate topological features, we utilize knowledge distillation (KD), which is a promising way to generate a smaller model using larger models. Multiple teachers can be adopted to enrich features in KD. However, this approach has presented two key challenges: 1) differences in feature dimensions from multimodal data and 2) conflicting knowledge provided by the different teachers, both of which can degrade the student model’s performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel KD framework called multimodal global latent workspace-based KD (mGLW-KD) that is motivated by global workspace theory (GTW) from cognitive neuroscience. GWT models how the brain integrates and distributes relevant information across different neural modules through a shared workspace, and it includes attentional control and working memory to prioritize and retain key information. Inspired by this theory, mGLW-KD incorporates a working memory module to unify diverse knowledge from multiple teacher models into a shared latent workspace, facilitating efficient knowledge transfer to the student model. By integrating topological insights with cognitive principles, mGLW-KD addresses the challenges posed by wearable sensor data and enables the student model to achieve superior performance using only time-series input during inference."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Cross-domain fault diagnosis based on unsupervised domain adaptation has gained much attention. However, current methods face key challenges due to the limited consideration of transferability. Specifically, they primarily align fault features exclusively within identical-depth layers in the diagnostic model, assuming that these features share same transferability, leading to feature dislocation and reduced diagnostic accuracy. In reality, fault features with similar transferability often emerge across distinct-depth layers, especially under complex conditions where fault signal spectral characteristics shift significantly. Moreover, conventional methods usually treat all parameters with uniform transferability, failing to distinguish domain-specific fault features from transferable ones. This indiscriminate treatment risks negative transfer and poor diagnosis ability under diverse conditions. To address these limitations, a novel parameter-optimal adaptive layer mapping network (ParALM) guided by transferability is proposed. ParALM establishes inter-layer mapping pairs to capture distinct-level fault features across layers, aligning signal characteristics that vary with conditions. In parallel, ParALM adaptively categorizes model parameters into transfer-wise and transfer-limited ones, updating only the former to selectively preserve transferable diagnostic information. Comprehensive experiments on a dataset and a real-world diagnostic system demonstrate that ParALM outperforms state-of-the-art methods. ParALM yields diagnostic performance improvements of 2.89% and 1.99% over the best-performing competitor on two cases (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.05), while exhibiting the lowest standard deviations of 1.13% and 1.22%, which verifies its superiority and stability."

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean squared error performance with 8× less complexity. To address model adaptation in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness."

However, their flexibility also introduces cybersecurity risks, as adversaries can exploit them for malicious purposes. A promising defense technique involves using electromagnetic interference to selectively neutralize rogue drones—provided their communication parameters can be precisely identified.In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to autonomously identify the frequency–power pair susceptible to interference for an unknown drone-controller system. The agent operates in a large search space, guided by an environment modeled with dynamic hot zones. It is designed to minimize probing steps and energy consumption, making it suitable for time- and resource-constrained defensive scenarios. Experimental results in a simulated environment show that the agent achieves 90% accuracy in identifying effective jamming parameters, demonstrating its potential as a real-time, adaptive cybersecurity countermeasure for drone-based threats."

This adaptive morphing, not only enhances wireless channel conditions, but also significantly curtails power consumption. This paper conducts an adaptive performance analysis of a wireless system, in which a FIM-equipped base station (BS) leverages the presence of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to facilitate downlink transmission. To rigorously evaluate the system’s efficiency, we formulate an optimization problem centered on resource allocation, with the primary objective of maximizing the network achievable data rate. This maximization is subject to multiple constraints, especially on stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of users and the BS finite power budget. Due to the highly intricate interdependencies among optimization variables and the inherent non-convexity of the problem, we strategically reformulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP), encapsulating its dynamic characteristics. To derive an optimal solution, we train a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent, relying on MDP, which simultaneously optimizes the decision variables: the BS transmit beamforming, the morphology of the FIM and the reflection coefficient matrix of the RIS. Furthermore, to accommodate the real-world challenges imposed by user mobility, we enhance the generalization of the DDPG model through the integration of meta-learning technique, thereby significantly improving its adaptability to system variations. Numerical evaluations affirm that incorporating an RIS yields a pronounced improvement in achievable network data rate, particularly when the BS transmit power budget is maintained within a moderate operational range."

However, the creation of 3D videos predominantly relies on computer graphics (CG) animation generated through motion capture, which typically requires specialized technical expertise. This research proposes a pseudo-3D video teaching material viewable on smartphones, created by capturing the subject from multiple directions using several omnidirectional cameras and stitching the videos together using Mixed Reality (MR) technology. As these pseudo-3D video materials can be viewed from a full 360-degree perspective, they enable focused observation of specific body movements that are crucial for understanding.

We develop an agent-based simulation that explicitly captures data’s non-rivalrous resale and dynamic trust among trading agents. Buyers and sellers interact over Barabási–Albert, Watts–Strogatz, and Erdős–Rényi networks, employing three strategies: Price (minimize cost), Trust (maximize reputation), and Hybrid (trust filter then lowest price). Price-only agents quickly exhaust low-cost supply, collapsing transactions; Trust-only agents concentrate demand, inflating prices, and excluding budget-sensitive buyers. Hybrid agents sustain volume and stabilize prices by balancing cost and reputation. Our findings suggest that combining trust-based selection with price optimization fosters a resilient, efficient data marketplace, guiding the design of future data-exchange platforms."

Carrier phase positioning (CPP) enables sub-meter to centimeter-level accuracy and is gaining interest in 5G-Advanced standardization. While CPP typically complements time-of-arrival (ToA) measurements, recent literature has introduced a phase-only positioning approach in a distributed antenna/MIMO system context with minimal bandwidth requirements, using deep learning (DL) when operating under ideal hardware assumptions. In more practical scenarios, however, antenna failures can largely degrade the performance. In this paper, we address the challenging phase-only positioning task, and propose a new DL-based localization approach harnessing the so-called hyperbola intersection principle, clearly outperforming the previous methods. Additionally, we consider and propose a processing and learning mechanism that is robust to antenna element failures. Our results show that the proposed DL model achieves robust and accurate positioning despite antenna impairments, demonstrating the viability of data-driven, impairment-tolerant phase-only positioning mechanisms. Comprehensive set of numerical results demonstrates large improvements in localization accuracy against the prior art methods."

A base station (BS) configured with a two-dimensional MA array simultaneously serves multiple communication users and sensing multiple targets. To enhance system capacity, superimposed symbols are transmitted to communication users, with successive interference cancellation (SIC) employed for signal decoding. Our objective is to maximize the total illumination power at the targets while satisfying the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for communication users. To achieve this goal, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that jointly optimizes the transmit power allocation, beamforming, sensing covariance matrix, and antenna positions. Numerical results show that the MA system achieves significant improvement in illumination power compared to fixed-position antennas (FPAs), with particularly significant gains under high SINR requirements."

The goal of this work is to explore the use of wireless sensing in conjunction with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enable the detection of the surface temperature of a target object. Our framework for detecting the target surface temperature based on the channel state information (CSI) of WiFi signals utilises a low-complexity classifier algorithm, specifically the linear support vector machine. With a prototype constructed with commodity embedded systems, we experimentally validated the feasibility of our proposed framework for detecting surface temperature levels with more than 93% accuracy at a resolution of 2°C. In addition, we evaluated the robustness of our embedded AI-based WiFI sensing technology. We identified that accuracy is subject to degradation with deployment conditions such as over-range, imbalanced positioning, and inadequate transmit power. Overall, with adequate accuracy, our WiFi CSI-based surface temperature detection framework provides a low-cost, massively deployable, and non-invasive solution for practical temperature surveillance applications involving heat-sensitive products."

    "abstract": "To enable seamless 5G service continuity for mobile ground users traversing infrastructure-limited or obstructed regions, the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks based on Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations is being actively pursued. However, the mobility dynamics of ground terminals frequently result in sudden Line-of-Sight loss, which undermines the feasibility of conventional handover preparation involving context transfer, synchronization, and identity continuity. Without pre-coordination, such transitions lead to uplink blindness, session interruption, and degraded performance. This paper addresses the handover problem under Non-Terrestrial Network-specific constraints by (i) defining a structured taxonomy of service continuity mechanisms suited for impaired Line-of-Sight conditions, (ii) introducing an analytical model that captures handover delay, authentication feasibility, and buffer dimensioning under varying visibility regimes, and (iii) quantitatively evaluating these mechanisms in a high-mobility highway scenario. The results underline that while context mirroring ensures superior continuity under full coordination, handover with reactive preparation emerges as the most practical and resilient fallback under constrained Non-Terrestrial-Networks conditions."

Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 11%."

We evaluate model performance using two metrics and confirm its robustness across settings.

    "abstract": "Key quality variables in industrial processes are usually difficult to measure directly. Soft sensing technology predicts hard-to-measure key parameters using easily obtained process variables. This improves process monitoring and control accuracy, reduces reliance on costly equipment, and lowers production costs. As industrial processes become more complex, process data tend to be complex, nonlinear, and multivariate. Therefore, it is very necessary to capture the temporal and spatial correlations between process data. In this paper, a new soft sensing model based on exponential long short-term memory and spatiotemporal feature fusion (STG-eLSTM) is proposed. The spatiotemporal convolution is introduced to initially capture the temporal and spatial dependencies in the data. In order to further learn the dependencies over a long period of time and remember important historical information, an LSTM network improved with exponential gating (eLSTM) is introduced. The introduction of exponential gating can provide more dynamic information filtering capabilities and help improve the memory and forgetting process. At the same time, in order to deepen the understanding of the graph structure, the application of GNN allows the model to directly operate on the data of the graph structure and deeply explore the complex interaction patterns between variables. In addition, the gated neurons are used to weight the prediction results of each layer and output the final value. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verified by the industrial case of debutanizer."

    "abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) has emerged as a promising solution for channel estimation. By leveraging high-resolution 3D models of the scenario and ray-tracing simulations, DT could provide valuable site-specific prior knowledge on the channel’s space-time (ST) invariant features of the multipath environment, such as angles of arrival, angles of departure, and propagation delays. However, the real-time characterization of these features imposes computational constraints on ray-tracing simulations, hence limiting the prior knowledge of the multipath environment and corresponding ST features, and degrading estimation accuracy. In this paper, we propose and investigate, for the first time, three distinct DT-empowered low-rank methods for channel estimation, under different degrees of prior knowledge corresponding to limited number of paths provided by DT. Specifically, these methods perform modal projection onto a joint space-time, a spatial, and a temporal subspace. We compare our proposed methods with state-of-the-art techniques, and evaluate their performance in a synthetic scenario. Numerical results show that robustness, when prior knowledge is limited to few paths, is achieved when exploiting only temporal features, while estimation accuracy is attained when joint space-time features are considered."

This work extends the data-oriented framework to include physical layer security, focusing on jamming and eavesdropping threats. We analyze how constant and random jamming affect DOR in the multi-antenna systems, highlighting the role of spatial and spectral resources in mitigation. Our analysis, supported by empirical simulations, offers new insights for designing secure, low-latency systems resilient to jamming—supporting robust ultra- or hyper-reliable low-latency communications in future 6G networks."

    "abstract": "Jumping ability is an important element of performance in many sports, and is particularly essential in sports that involve vertical movements, such as volleyball, basketball, and athletics. Since an athlete’s jumping ability is directly linked to their competitive performance, there has been a wide range of research on the theme of jumping in sports movements in the field of biomechanics. Previous research has focused on the influence of muscle activity in the trunk and lower limbs related to jumping on performance [1][2]. However, there has not been enough research focusing on the relaxation and muscle contraction of the upper limbs, so this study focuses on the influence of these on jumping ability. It is difficult to make inexperienced sports players intuitively understand movements such as \"relaxing your shoulders\" and \"putting strength into your shoulders\" from words. However, it is even more difficult to instruct athletes by directly touching their bodies in the air, making it difficult to teach them how to acquire appropriate jumping movements. To solve this problem, it is necessary to design a device that stimulates specific parts of the body during jumping movements and makes beginners aware of the timing of applying force, allowing them to intuitively acquire appropriate movements."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of mega-constellations in low Earth orbit (LEO) has led to an enormous increase in the number of satellites occupying this region of space. Currently, they number over ten thousand and are expected to grow by tens of thousands in the next decade. This has led to increased demand for fit-for purpose, high-fidelity on-orbit sensing systems for (i) accurate orbit determination, conjunction assessment and collision avoidance in an increasingly congested space environment, for enhanced Space Domain Awareness (SDA); (ii) supporting the autonomy of future space infrastructure including in-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing. This paper discusses two strategies for on-orbit SDA provision– dedicated and co-operative– performed using space based sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging, in monostatic and bistatic configurations. Initially, a dedicated observational platform for satellite constellation observations, with an ISAR capability separate from the constellation, is assessed. Then, a concept of co-operative space domain awareness (CoSDA) is presented, accompanied by the comprehensive analysis of density, dynamics, and rates of conjunctions in existing and projected future constellations. The feasibility of simultaneous monostatic, bistatic, and multistatic ISAR observations is discussed, with a use case considered in detail. Diverse ISAR images are simulated in the Graphical Electromagnetic ISAR Simulator for Sub-THz waves (GEIST). The simulation results are analysed to determine the advantages of simultaneous mono-, bi-, and multi-static sub-THz ISAR for characterisation of the imaged Resident Space Object (RSO)."

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, device identification has emerged as a critical challenge for ensuring the security of wireless communications. Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting, a physical-layer security approach that requires no hardware modifications, has attracted considerable attention for its cost-effectiveness and robust security properties. Conventional RF fingerprinting models insufficiently exploit signal characteristics, thereby constraining recognition accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a Multi-Channel Attention Residual Fusion (MCARF) method. It integrates five heterogeneous signal representations, including raw IQ data, individual in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components, and features derived from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), to comprehensively capture device-specific characteristics. To effectively manage the heterogeneity across these channels, a Dual Attention Residual Block (DARB) is introduced to amplify critical feature responses while mitigating the vanishing gradient issue in deep neural networks. Additionally, a Multi-Channel Feature Fusion (MCFF) module is developed to adaptively learn inter-channel feature weights through attention mechanisms, thereby enhancing relevant information and suppressing redundant or noisy data. Extensive experiments conducted on two representative datasets, namely a simulated dataset under varying SNR conditions and the real-world ORACLE dataset, demonstrate that MCARF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Moreover, the MCARF method exhibits superior discriminative capability, particularly in challenging low-SNR environments."

    "abstract": "Virtual mass simulation is one of the recent topics in the field of haptic devices (HDs), which can alter the apparent mass of the HD. Simulating negative values of virtual mass leads to a decrease in the apparent effective mass, improving transparency but weakening stability. Positive virtual mass rendering increases the apparent mass, reduces transparency, and enhances stability. This paper analyzes the stability of a haptic device while simulating a virtual environment consisting of a mass, spring, and damper in the presence of a constant time delay. The results are closed-form equations that can predict the stability boundary for small and even large values of virtual damping and time delay. These closed-form equations demonstrate that the maximum renderable virtual mass is twice the physical mass of the HD, and the minimum value equals its negative; both occur in the case of zero time delay. Increasing the time delay reduces both the minimum and maximum values of the renderable virtual mass. The study also shows that using virtual mass can improve the maximum value of a renderable virtual spring. The equations show that, in the absence of delay, properly tuning the virtual mass and virtual damping can enlarge the maximum renderable stiffness by up to 5.8 times in theory. In the experiments under time delay, the stiffness increased by a factor of 3.5, compared to the theoretical prediction of 4.1 times. The results further reveal situations where a nonzero <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">minimum</i> stiffness is required for stability. All findings are validated via simulations and experiments on a dedicated test bed."

    "abstract": "A network for single-view satellite image height estimation driven by multi-stage adaptive feature enhancement mechanism, named MAFENet, is proposed. Single satellite images inherently contain limited explicit height information and are often characterized by complex height layouts among densely distributed buildings. These factors collectively contribute to the complexity of height estimation from single-view satellite imagery. Current height estimation methods frequently employ simplistic or singular feature fusion strategies, thus incurring information loss when fusing multi-level features. To address these challenges, an adaptive feature enhancement mechanism for each stage of feature fusion is proposed. Specifically, Dual-channel Adaptive Fusion Hybrid Attention (DAFH) and Hybrid Attention-Driven Multi-Scale Fusion (HAMF) are proposed to implement feature fusion and enhancement operations. These components are designed to discriminate building features and enhance the refinement of building boundary details. Experimental results on the satellite datasets DFC2019 and DFC2023 demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in polymer microwave fiber (PMF) technology have created significant opportunities for robust, low-cost, and high-speed sub-terahertz (THz) radio-over-fiber communications. Recognizing these potential benefits, this paper explores a novel radio-over-fiber (RoF) structure that interconnects multiple radio units (RUs), booster units (BUs), and a central unit (CU) in cascade via fiber, envisioning its application in indoor scenarios. This structure creates a number of research opportunities when considering cascaded distortion effects introduced by non-linear power amplifiers (PAs) and the propagation channel over the fiber. We propose maximum-likelihood and non-linear least-squares algorithms to estimate the entry RU and the time-of-arrival between the RoF and the user equipment, where estimating the entry RU is equivalent to estimating the propagation distance along the RoF stripe. For the case of linear PAs, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound to benchmark the performance of the estimators. Finally, we investigate the use of the system for uplink positioning. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform satisfactorily even with the cascaded effects of non-linear PAs, and that the deployment of this RoF structure can enable new cost-effective opportunities for high-resolution positioning in indoor scenarios. In the numerical evaluation, we also use measured PMF characteristics for high-density polyethylene fibers."

This paper investigates a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) empowered integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system assisted by movable antennas (MAs). We consider a dual functional radar and communication (DFRC) base station (BS) equipped with a two-dimensional (2D) MA array, which simultaneously senses multiple targets and serves users divided into multiple clusters. Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is employed within each cluster to suppress intra-cluster interference. To enhance the total illumination power at the sensing targets while guaranteeing the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) requirements at the users, we formulate an optimization problem for joint power allocation, beamforming, and antenna position design. To address this highly coupled and non-convex problem, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is proposed. We first determine the SIC decoding order by the equivalent-channel-to-interference-plus-noise-ratios (ECINRs), and derive the close-form solutions of the optimal intra-and-inter cluster power allocation coefficients. The sub-problems of beamforming and antenna position design are solved by semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) based schemes, respectively. Numerical simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline schemes, which achieves approximately 2 dB illumination power gain compared to the conventional fixed position antennas (FPA), demonstrating the promising potential of MAs in wireless networks."

While prior studies focus on first-order spatiotemporal MD reliability, applications beyond this structure remain unexplored. This work introduces a second-order MD reliability analysis framework and applies it to spatial-spectral-temporal MD analysis for frequency-hopping THz communication. Numerical results show how inner-layer target reliabilities in temporal/spectral domains affect overall spatial MD reliability. It is also shown that adopting a non-uniform frequency-hopping pattern enhances spatial MD reliability but reduces resiliency and increases jamming risk."

To adopt FTN signaling, intersymbol interference (ISI) patterns need to be equalized at the receiver. Motivated by the pattern recognition capabilities of convolutional neural networks with skip connections, we propose such deep learning architecture for ISI equalization and symbol demodulation in FTN receivers. We investigate the performance of the proposed model considering quadrature phase shift keying modulation and low density parity check coding, and compare it to a set of benchmarks, including frequency-domain equalization, a quadratic-programming-based receiver, and an equalization scheme based on a deep neural network. We show that our receiver outperforms any benchmark, achieving error rates comparable to those in additive white Gaussian noise channel, and higher effective throughput, thanks to the increased spectral efficiency of FTN signaling. With a compression factor of 60% and code rate 3/4, the proposed model achieves a peak effective throughput of 2.5 Mbps at just 10dB of energy per bit over noise power spectral density ratio, with other receivers being limited by error floors due to the strong intersymbol interference.

This enhances opportunities for future services, including integrating satellite and terrestrial networks. In this paper, we have developed an SDN-enabled framework for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, incorporating the Open-Flow protocol, all within an OMNeT++ simulation environment. Dynamic controller assignment is one of the most significant challenges for large LEO constellations. Due to the movement of LEO satellites, satellite-controller assignments must be updated frequently to maintain low propagation delays. To address this issue, we present a dynamic satellite-to-controller assignment (DSCA) optimization problem that continuously adjusts these assignments. Our optimal DSCA (Opt-DSCA) approach minimizes propagation delay and optimizes the number of active controllers. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the DSCA approach significantly outperforms the static satellite-to-controller assignment (SSCA) approach. While SSCA may perform better with more controllers, this scheme fails to adapt to satellite movements. Our DSCA approach consistently improves network efficiency by dynamically reassigning satellites based on propagation delays. Further, we found diminishing returns when the number of controllers is increased beyond a certain point, suggesting optimal performance with a limited number of controllers. Opt-DSCA lowers propagation delays and improves network performance by optimizing satellite assignments and reducing active controllers."

    "abstract": "The remote identification (Remote ID) broadcast capability allows unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to exchange messages, which is a pivotal technology for inter-UAV communications. Although this capability enhances the operational visibility, low delay in Remote ID-based communications is critical for ensuring the efficiency and timeliness of multi-UAV operations in dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we first establish delay models for Remote ID communications by considering packet reception and collisions across both BLE 4 and Wi-Fi protocols. Building upon these models, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the long-term communication delay through adaptive protocol selection. Since the delay performance varies with the UAV density, we propose an adaptive BLE/Wi-Fi switching algorithm based on the multi-agent deep Q-network approach. Experimental results demonstrate that in dynamic-density scenarios, our strategy achieves 32.1% and 37.7% lower latency compared to static BLE 4 and Wi-Fi modes respectively."

    "abstract": "Active intelligent reflecting surface (AIRS) is expected to further improve wireless communication performance compared to traditional passive IRS (PIRS) due to its additional signal amplification capability. To leverage the benefits of AIRSs at the network level, we investigate a new AIRS-user association problem in a general wireless network consisting of multiple base stations (BSs), users and distributed IRSs. Specifically, each AIRS assists in the communication from its associated BS to user, while randomly scattering and amplifying interference and noise to all users. We first derive the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (ASINR) achievable at each user for any given AIRS-user associations. We then analytically compare the ASINRs of multi-AIRS and multi-PIRS networks in terms of different metrics, gaining key insights into the advantages of AIRSs over PIRSs at the network level. Furthermore, we jointly optimize AIRS-user associations to maximize the minimum ASINR among all users and propose an efficient successive refinement algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results validate our performance analysis and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm over other baseline schemes."

    "abstract": "Sixth-Generation (6G) networks necessitate intelligent and energy-efficient operations. However, the direct deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-time 6G control is hindered by significant latency and energy constraints, conflicting with green 6G imperatives. This paper pioneers a collaborative architecture of large-small AI models to address these challenges. In this architecture, resource-intensive LLMs, i.e., large models, are strategically employed offline for comprehensive Wireless Data Knowledge Graph (WDKG) construction, effectively distilling domain knowledge. This WDKG, in turn, enables the development and deployment of lightweight, efficient small models for real-time network tasks by facilitating the generation of optimized feature datasets. To operationalize this, we first introduce a novel multi-agent collaborative LLM framework, bolstered by an enhanced semantic representation method incorporating domain-adaptive embedding fine-tuning and mutual information (MI)-based feature encoding, for automated high-fidelity WDKG construction. Subsequently, we propose the Semantic-Data and Spatio-Temporal (SD-ST) model, which uniquely fuses LLM-extracted semantic information with the spatio-temporal characteristics of wireless network data and WDKG structure. Insights from the SD-ST model guide a WDKG-driven method for generating optimized feature datasets by evaluating node influence and redundancy. Experimental validation demonstrates that these distilled feature datasets lead to substantial reductions in training and inference overhead for the lightweight downstream AI models, offering a tangible pathway towards greener, more efficient, and intelligent 6G networks."

    "abstract": "Variable leakage flux machine (VLFM) is considered a competitive candidate for electric vehicle (EV) applications due to its distinct advantages of a wide speed range and high overall efficiency. Meanwhile, the active-short-circuit (ASC) technique is widely implemented for EV traction drive systems to prevent hardware damage from overvoltage during high-speed operation. However, it may induce large ASC currents and unexpected PM demagnetization in turn. Therefore, this paper firstly investigates the potential of ASC fault tolerance in VLFMs, introducing a segmented, arc-shaped PM VLFM design aimed at simultaneously achieving a wide speed range, high efficiency, and improved ASC fault-tolerant capability. Initially, the topologies of the benchmark PM machine (PMM) and VLFMs are introduced and clarified. Then, an ASC fault analysis is conducted to elucidate its underlying principles, and both the steady and transient short-circuit currents are analyzed and compared under ideal scenarios, demonstrating the inherent ASC fault tolerance of the VLFMs. Furthermore, the electromagnetic characteristics, e.g., loss distributions and efficiency maps, are compared and investigated, verifying the advantages of the proposed design in terms of speed range and high-speed efficiency. Finally, a prototype is built and experimentally tested to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed VLFM design. The results provide valuable insights for traction machine design considering practical ASC operation in EV applications."

However, the growth of corpora and the demand for real-time queries expose the memory capacity and bandwidth limitations of DRAM-centric architectures. To address this challenge, we adopt CXL memory in conjunction with cluster-scale RAG deployments and optimize the system in terms of performance, latency and cost efficiency. Our design leverages state-of-the-art CXL memory devices and platforms with memory management policies such as weighted interleaving and tiering between DRAM and CXL memory. In comparison with a DRAM baseline, our system archives 20% higher vector search performance and 43% lower LLM time-to-first token (TTFT), demonstrating clear end-to-end performance benefits. Moreover, in the context of overall system efficiency, we observed up to 20% and 42% improvement in power efficiency (QPS/Watt) and cost efficiency (QPS/$), respectively. These results demonstrate that, despite the relatively high latency of CXL memory, memory management policy-level optimization enable CXL memory to serve as a first-class memory resource in cluster-based RAG systems."

In particular, we solve the time-slot resource sharing problem as a sequential decision-making problem by utilizing a Deep Recurrent Q-network (DRQN) to handle partial observability within the environment. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the typical algorithm FPRP with respect to the throughput and mitigating packet loss."

This paper presents an energy-aware control framework that combines active responses with passive compliance for safety-critical robotic manipulation. Specifically, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are employed for active collision avoidance with detected obstacles, which are then integrated with fallback safety actions to resolve potential violation of CBF constraints. Complementing this active safety paradigm, a passive safety paradigm is implemented to mitigate post-collision impacts by monitoring energy variance and limiting power exchanges. Furthermore, an energy tank is incorporated to enforce passivity of the robot, which is crucial to address potential instability issues in variable impedance control. To make the tank adaptive to varying energy requirements arising from dynamic environments and unpredictable events, we propose a novel, task-agnostic tank recharging condition without compromising the system's passivity guarantee. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is validated through experiments on a KUKA iiwa 14 robot."

Here we concentrated on late blight disease, which is a widespread problem in Indian agriculture, and manually annotated a dataset of 4,648 images divided into three stages depending on the level of leaf damage (Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3) and healthy leaves. The dataset was divided into $80 \\%$ training and $20 \\%$ test sets. The model obtained a training accuracy of $93.68 \\%$ and testing accuracy of $95.56 \\%$. The system also offers stage-wise medication recommendations for disease management. When given multiple photos from the same plant with different disease stages, the model predicts the stage for each leaf and finally highlights the highest stage along with suggesting the treatment for that highest stage. A simple web application was implemented to support image uploads, detection of disease stages, and tracking of history. The uniqueness of this project is the stage-wise detection of disease in tomato plants, similar to cancer staging, which presents a new contribution to precision agriculture."

    "abstract": "Extreme operating conditions in metal smelting often impair sensor performance, posing significant challenges to the accurate monitoring of key process indicators. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a mechanism-data co-driven approach for enhanced sensing of critical indicators. Initially, a smelting mechanism model, grounded in mass conservation and dynamic heat balance, is established to facilitate preliminary interpolation using sparse manually sampled data. Subsequently, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based compensation model is introduced to capture the distinct dynamics of the smelting process, enabling the reconstruction of comprehensive key-indicator sequences. Leveraging these sequences, a sequence-guided probabilistic prediction model is developed, employing a CNN-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Attention architecture. By integrating a hybrid quantile loss function, the model delivers multiple quantile outputs, providing both precise point predictions and multi-confidence intervals. These outputs support fault diagnosis, early warning systems, and continuous process optimization. Simulation results validate that the proposed method effectively reconstructs critical indicator sequences from limited data, achieving high-accuracy sensing. Overall, this approach presents an innovative solution to boost production efficiency in metal smelting while significantly reducing the reliance on manual labor."

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication enables ultra-high data rates but suffers from severe path loss, especially under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. Cell-free networks with distributed base stations (BSs) mitigate this by increasing the chance of at least one BS maintaining a line-of-sight (LoS) link to each user equipment (UE). Integrated beamforming further boosts performance by focusing energy in desired directions. Conventional beam training uses exhaustive beam sweeping, testing all beam pair combinations from predefined codebooks via received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. While effective, this method incurs significant latency and energy costs, particularly as the codebook size increases with the number of transmit and receive antennas. To address this, we propose a learning-based approach for cell-free mmWave systems that predicts RSSI matrices from UE and BS coordinates, eliminating the need for exhaustive sweeping. We train two conditional diffusion models—a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and a faster denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM). Our method reduces beam training overhead by up to 97% while maintaining at least 94% of the peak rate achieved via exhaustive search. DDIM further enables simultaneous RSSI generation for 64 UEs at 60% of the time required by conventional methods, significantly cutting overhead with minimal performance loss."

As revealed, the local density of discrete data points in the dynamometer card can also reflect information about operating conditions. Based on this observation, a dynamometer card local density-based fault diagnosis method is proposed, where an adaptive and boundary-concerned method is proposed to construct the gray-scale matrix, and a support vector machine is established to recognize operating conditions.

Practical arrays have mutual coupling between the elements of the array that can significantly affect the accuracy of localization algorithms. In this paper, we utilize a practical array to evaluate the performance of an iterative method based on oblique projection (IMOP) in estimating the location of near-field sources. The conventional two-dimensional (2D) search method for near-field source localization (TSMNSL) employs a 2D search to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) and range of the source, resulting in a high computational load. In contrast, the IMOP method uses one-dimensional searches, which significantly reduces computational complexity. The results of numerical and full-wave electromagnetic simulations in this paper show that the performance of DOA and range estimations in the IMOP method is comparable to that in the TSMNSL method. The simulation results further indicate that the computational complexity of the IMOP method is at least 49 times lower than that of the TSMNSL method."

It exploits the hardware impairments in the analog front-end components of the transmitter as the identifying features. However, the DL-RFFI system struggles to generalize in unseen domains, i.e., when trained at closer distances and tested at longer distances, the DL-RFFI shows significant performance degradation. In this paper, we design a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) based DL-RFFI system, mainly focused on a multi-distance scenario. We use Long-Range (LoRa) technology as our case study and collect LoRa RF data at multiple distances from 5 to 30m. We train our model using several signal representation methods, namely, raw In-phase and Quadrature (IQ), frequency domain (FFT), and a combination of both. In addition, we also present a fusion model based on additional features extracted from IQ data using an open-source feature extraction library. Our experimental results show that our fusion model can achieve higher device identification accuracy of over 91% on unseen distance (25 and 30m) data when the model is trained on data from 5 to 20m only."

To address this, we propose and evaluate a LoRaWAN-based Mesh (LoRaMesh) Network. We compare the maximum communication distance achievable in a one-hop scenario with obstacles to that in a two-hop scenario using a relay node. Our system uses three Arduino units with LoRa Shields, configured as transmitter, relay, and receiver nodes, respectively, to form a mesh topology. Experiments are conducted in two environments: one with a clear line of sight and another with dense obstacles. In the clear environment, the relay increases the maximum communication distance by 1.5 km, while in the obstacle-rich one, the increase is 420 m-about one-third of that in the clear environment. These results show that mesh networking can effectively extend LoRaWAN coverage even in an obstructed environment, but the degree of improvement is highly dependent on the environment surrounding the receiver nodes."

The considered scheme exploits multiple dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) base stations (BSs) in order to (i) better illuminate the sensed environment and increase the target detection performance, and (ii) ensure secure communication with respect to several malicious targets. The cluster of cooperating BSs beamform the confidential signals beams to the receiving legitimate users as well as an artificial noise (AN) signal to the set of malicious targets, whereby the AN signal is designed for sensing malicious targets and safeguarding confidential signals from being leaked to the latter nodes, acting as eavesdroppers. By optimizing the transmit beamforming and AN covariance matrices at each of the DFRC BSs, the network’s sensing performance is maximized subject to a minimal secrecy capacity and power constraints. The obtained results demonstrate the proposed cooperative ISAC scheme’s potential in enhancing the sensing performance compared to the baseline (i) single-BS DFRC-ISAC scheme and (ii) cooperative DFRC-ISAC employing a zero-forcing beamforming."

In this work, we use a particle filter to combine the time difference of arrival (TDoA) and angle of arrival (AoA) measurements in the mmWave band for a more accurate position estimate. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm by examining the positioning performance with that of the individual measurements using the least square (LS) method and hybrid measurements using the weighted least square (WLS) method. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid particle filter (PF)-based algorithm improves the positioning accuracy by 23.9% compared to that of the hybrid WLS-based method. The combination of the hybrid TDoA and AoA measurements results in a mean positioning error of 17.4 cm."

    "abstract": "This paper is intended to provide physical insight into the phased array design parameters that affect the symmetry of its beam pattern (and frequency response in case of a series-fed array). Qualitative conclusions are derived from the quantitative analysis of the effects of a spare antenna added to a uniform linearly spaced array. Two cases are described in detail depending on the positioning of the spare antenna and on the phase of its radiated signal. Analytical equations are derived to perform the zero forcing of a sidelobe on a single side (or both sides) of the radiation pattern, in case the antenna has a non-zero phase shift (or an additional true-time delay) with respect to that related to the steering direction. This analysis is particularly dictated to simplify the beam synthesis in case of ground-reflection or sensing applications."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) is an emerging paradigm that leverages semantic-level understanding to improve communication efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios. However, existing SemCom systems often overlook diverse computational and communication capabilities and requirements among different users. Motivated by the need to adaptively balance semantic accuracy, latency, and energy consumption, this paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for semantic compression model (SCM) selection and resource allocation in multi-user SemCom systems. To address the challenges of balancing image reconstruction quality and communication performance, a system-level optimization metric called Rate-Distortion Efficiency (RDE) has been defined. The framework considers multiple SCMs with varying complexity and resource requirements. A proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based RL approach is developed to dynamically select SCMs and allocate bandwidth and power under non-convex constraints. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several baseline strategies. This paper also discusses the generalization ability, computational complexity, scalability, and practical implications of the framework for real-world SemCom systems."

    "abstract": "Multi-Command Posts (MCPs) in tactical ad hoc networks were proposed to solve network congestion and battery depletion on nodes around a single CP. However, since current model-driven approaches for MCPs often rely on simplified metrics, they fail to adapt to the harsh dynamics of the environment. To address this issue, this paper presents a new approach called SRRL (Stability and Recovery-aware Reinforcement Learning), a Q-learning based routing protocol designed to operate effectively in such conditions. SRRL consists of two phases: the source node first selects a target MCP by assessing the viability of each destination based on learned values and one-hop link stability; then, each forwarding node makes hop-by-hop decisions based on a score that reflects path stability, link quality, and residual energy. The influence of energy in this score is adjusted dynamically according to the node’s current state, and a lightweight local recovery mechanism improves delivery robustness. SRRL achieves up to an 8.5% higher packet delivery ratio, enables 13.6% more nodes to remain operational, and extends the time to first node failure by 41.1% compared to conventional Qlearning methods, particularly under high mobility and heavy traffic conditions."

The underlying network includes mobile devices with multimedia service requirements, including web surfing, HTTP live video streaming and voice-over-LTE (VoLTE). Rather than conventional quality-of-service (QoS) metrics, we assess the satisfaction level of users relying on quality-of-experience (QoE) criteria. Invoking mean opinion score (MOS) as the subjective measurement of QoE, we also evaluate the overall efficacy of this system by posing a resource allocation optimization problem aimed at maximizing the achievable MOS of all users, while adhering to their minimum MOS requirements and the maximum transmit power budget of the BS. Due to the interdependency of optimization variables and non-convex nature of the problem, we first reformulate it in Markov decision process, which captures its dynamic traits. Relying on the MDP model, a conservative Q-learning (CQL) agent is trained for jointly designing the optimization variables, including the BS downlink transmit power, as well as the electromagnetic response of the SIM. In light of real-time mobility of users and the resulting non-trivial network dynamism, we further utilize meta-learning technique to enhance the adaptability and generalization of the CQL agent. Numerically, it is demonstrated that, respectively, 31%, 44% and 26% superior average MOS is achieved, for web, video and audio services, compared to traditional QoS-driven resource allocation."

This paper addresses the challenge in actual production where reducing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) residue in nascent fibers while maintaining stable fiber radius is difficult, and establishes a dynamic optimization model for coagulating process parameters. Subsequently, the changing time window-based robust optimization over time (CTWROOT) algorithm is proposed for solving and optimizing process parameters. This method simultaneously minimizes DMSO residue in nascent fibers and minimizes the absolute error between the actual fiber radius and the decision-maker's expected radius value, while reducing the average switching cost of the robust solution sequence by reusing robust solutions across multiple consecutive dynamic environments to decrease switching frequency, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for actual coagulating process production. Experimental results show that compared with ROOT/SCII, mROOT and DCROOT, the robust solution sequence obtained by CTWROOT has longer average survival time and lower average switching cost."

The system is configured with a dual-polarized (DP) multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antenna array at the receiver and a pair of DP antennas at the transmitter. During transmission, vertically and horizontally polarized antennas at the transmitter are employed to transmit two independent data streams partitioned via RS. At the receiver, a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-free detection scheme is adopted to exploit the polarization-domain degree of freedom (DoF), thereby eliminating the need for SIC. To validate the efficacy of the proposed RS-DP scheme, we optimize the combining vectors for both vertical and horizontal data streams to maximize the sum spectral efficiency under FBL constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the RS-DP scheme achieves performance comparable to the conventional RS-SIC approach, thereby corroborating its effectiveness in balancing system performance and decoding complexity."

Computer vision and deep learning algorithms have evolved into powerful tools for automating weed classification and identification, allowing for more precise weed management and environmentally friendly farming practices. This article includes substantial research into weed detection and classification utilizing cutting-edge deep learning techniques. The suggested method, which uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification, is very accurate in weed and crop separation. Furthermore, the combination of transfer learning and attention approaches improves the system’s capacity to detect weeds in a variety of environmental situations, such as shifting lighting, occlusions, and complicated field backgrounds. The study employs publicly available datasets to illustrate the flexibility and dependability of the suggested technique. When compared to existing methodologies, experimental data show significant gains in precision, recall, and total classification accuracy. The study also looks at how AI-powered weed detection might save money, improve ecologically friendly agricultural methods, and reduce the need for chemical herbicides in precision agriculture. The findings show that cutting-edge AI technology has the ability to solve immediate agricultural challenges while also setting the path for future smart farming improvements."

Specifically, a LEO satellite-enabled bistatic ISAC system is constructed, in which the LEO satellite simultaneously transmits both communication and sensing signals, while the ground gateway receives the echoes to enable cooperative sensing. To balance communication performance and sensing accuracy, the upper bound of the achievable communication rate based on statistical channel state information and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) expression for two-dimensional angle-of-arrival estimation are derived. A joint beamforming optimization problem is then formulated with the objective of minimizing the CRB. Subsequently, a semidefinite relaxation method is introduced to transform the original non-convex problem into an equivalent semidefinite program, and a closed-form rank-one solution is constructed to satisfy the rank constraint. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LSEIB algorithm exhibits great convergence and optimization performance under various settings, and the proposed bistatic architecture achieves significant improvements in sensing performance compared to the monostatic counterpart."

Federated learning-based approaches allow the training of machine learning models directly on the IoVs without transferring the sensitive information to a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server. One persisting drawback in these approaches is that malicious IoVs may deliberately engage in malicious behaviors to manipulate the edge model training and reduce the trustworthiness of the system. To overcome this challenge, we propose a digital twin-enabled federated misbehavior detection model to collaboratively detect malicious behaviors in IoV networks without sharing sensitive data. Combining digital twin with IoV networks, we analyze real-world vehicle behavior and investigate various attack scenarios. We develop a federated misbehavior detection algorithm, which continuously learns and improves system performance by identifying malicious activities of potential attacks. This algorithm allows each IoV to process data locally and contribute to an edge model for a more robust and secure misbehavior detection model. Our simulation results show that the proposed federated learning model with the XGBoost algorithm detects attacks with a maximum accuracy of 99%, while also ensuring the trustworthiness of the data."

To overcome the limited operating bandwidth and poor isolation of the conventional dual-CP patch, multiple parasitic elements are used to produce additional resonance to improve the operating bandwidth. Interestingly, the capacitive couple between the patch and the parasitic elements also introduces a new coupling path flowing on the parasitic elements, which is opposite to the original coupling path between two ports. A weak-field area is therefore generated, and the isolation is improved. It is also worth noting that by using non-uniform parasitic elements, wide isolation bandwidth can be attained. The fabricated antenna prototype with overall dimensions of 0.83 λ × 0.83 λ × 0.03 λ has measured operating bandwidth of 17.8% (5.1– 6.1 GHz). Across this band, the isolation is always higher than 20 dB, and the broadside gain is from 5.2 to 7.6 dBi."

    "abstract": "Trajectory planning plays a pivotal role in robotic motion planning, particularly in achieving time-optimal motion under complex dynamic constraints. Although the Time-Optimal Path Parameterization (TOPP) algorithm effectively addresses trajectory generation under joint torque constraints, classical methods often overlook third-order constraints. As a result, the generated trajectories, while torque-feasible, exhibit excessive jerk and poor dynamic stability, which limits their practical applicability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a trajectory planning framework that simultaneously enforces torque and jerk constraints. Building upon torque-constrained TOPP, the method integrates a shooting-based strategy to identify switching points through bidirectional integration under jerk constraints and employs a Sigmoid-based fusion scheme to eliminate integration errors and ensure smooth transitions. The proposed approach is experimentally validated on a six-degree-of-freedom industrial robot. Comparative evaluations with the TOPP-RA algorithm demonstrate that the method significantly reduces both high-frequency vibrations during high-speed execution and residual oscillations after motion termination. Feedback from torque rate measurements, vibration sensors, and laser tracker data confirms faster settling and improved compliance, making the approach well-suited for complex industrial scenarios."

Fuzzy Neural Networks are utilized to estimate the unknown dynamics of the flexible manipulator system as well as the errors caused by input saturation. To address output constraints imposed within a prescribed time period, a time-shift function and an adjusted barrier function are introduced. The system’s stability is rigorously proven using the direct Lyapunov method. Finally, numerical simulations and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control approach."

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of dynamic trajectory planning for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in unknown environments. The existing methods often suffer from excessive computational burden, which creates the gap between theoretical approaches and practical swarm deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a distributed cooperative planning system (DCPS). The system consists of two levels: a trajectory planning level and a cooperative trajectory planning level. On the trajectory planning level, a kinodynamic Gaussian potential B-spline (KGPB) approach is designed by combining the local kinodynamic-A-star method and the Gaussian potential field B-spline method. Specifically, in the front-end, a trajectory is first generated by using the local kinodynamic-A-star method based on kinematics-dynamics constraints. And then, in the back-end, the trajectory is further optimized by using the Gaussian potential B-spline (GPB) method. On the cooperative trajectory planning level, a back field neighbor replanning (BFNP) approach is proposed, where each UAV only needs to communicate with the nearest neighbors. According to the potential collision region of the front UAV, the trajectory of the current UAV is dynamically improved to ensure safe and stable flight such that communication costs are significantly improved. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DCPS achieves at least a 27% increase in average velocity and a 24% reduction in traversal time for the UAV swarm compared to prior methods. The experimental outcomes provide further validation that the proposed DCPS can generate efficient and safe trajectories. For particular cases, the UAV operates at 97% of its maximum possible velocity. The proposed DCPS provides a reliable solution for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles in unknown environments."

    "abstract": "High-speed aerial grasping presents significant challenges due to the high demands on precise, responsive flight control and coordinated gripper manipulation. In this work, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Swooper</i>, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach that achieves both precise flight control and active gripper control using a single lightweight neural network policy. Training such a policy directly via DRL is nontrivial due to the complexity of coordinating flight and grasping. To address this, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: we first pre-train a flight control policy, and then fine-tune it to acquire grasping skills. With the carefully designed reward functions and training framework, the entire training process completes in under 60 minutes on a standard desktop with an Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU. To validate the trained policy in the real world, we develop a lightweight quadrotor grasping platform equipped with a simple off-the-shelf gripper, and deploy the policy in a zero-shot manner on the onboard Raspberry Pi 4B computer, where each inference takes only about 1.0 ms. In 25 real-world trials, our policy achieves an 84% grasp success rate and grasping speeds of up to 1.5 m/s without any fine-tuning. This matches the robustness and agility of state-of-the-art classical systems with sophisticated grippers, highlighting the capability of DRL for learning a robust control policy that seamlessly integrates high-speed flight and grasping."

Furthermore, the our system estimates the breathing rates of persons sitting in a car’s driver and/or front passenger seat. The experimental results confirm achieving a high precision for estimating the angle-of-arrival (AoA) and breathing rate.

With the introduction of UAV’s in wireless networks, the system architecture becomes heterogeneous, resulting in the need for dynamic and efficient management to avoid congestion and sustain overall performance. The presented framework compares two SNN-based optimization strategies. Specifically, a top-down centralized approach with complete network visibility and a bottom-up distributed approach for individual network nodes. The SNN is based on leak integrate-and-fire neurons with temporal components, which can perform fast and efficient event-driven inference. Realistic ray-tracing simulations are conducted, which showcase that the bottom-up model attains over 90% accuracy, while the top-down model maintains 80-100% accuracy. Both approaches reveal a trade-off between individually optimal solutions and UE-BS association feasibility, thus revealing the effectiveness of both approaches depending on deployment scenarios."

The present research focuses on the fusion of Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) and FUZZY AHP Geometric Mean approaches in order to maximize the reliability and precision of weather forecasting models. Fuzzy AHP was utilized to rank important meteorological variables-like atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and cloud cover—by decomposing the sophisticated decision process into a formal hierarchy of attributes. This method successfully addressed and overcame inherent uncertainty and subjectivity in weather forecasting. Fuzzy TOPSIS was then applied for ranking and evaluating different weather forecasting scenarios with an overall evaluation by taking both best and worst possible outcomes into account. The research concludes that although Fuzzy AHP always points to atmospheric pressure as the most important indicator, Fuzzy TOPSIS indicates cloud cover can also be critical. The results highlight the complementary effects of these methodologies in enhancing the precision of weather forecasting, particularly under the scenario of evermore erratic climate trends."

    "abstract": "Temporary grounding is a critical safety measure for electricians and field technicians during maintenance activities on electrical networks. As mandated by NR-10 (Regulatory Standard for Safety in Electrical Installations and Services), grounding is compulsory in de-energized circuits that are susceptible to accidental re-energization, serving as a primary protective mechanism against electric shock and arc flash hazards. This study investigates the risks associated with the absence or failure of temporary grounding systems, drawing upon real-world incidents and the lessons learned from them. Non-compliance with this safety protocol not only endangers worker safety but also exposes organizations to serious legal consequences and regulatory penalties. Best practices aligned with NR-10 are presented, including technical criteria for selecting grounding equipment, routine inspections, and comprehensive training programs to ensure proper implementation by qualified personnel. The research also underscores the importance of standardized procedures and safety checklists to ensure that the installation and removal of temporary grounding are conducted safely and efficiently. By emphasizing the necessity of compliance with NR-10, this study aims to foster an organizational culture centered on electrical safety, thereby mitigating risks and reducing the incidence of workplace accidents. The adoption of safe temporary grounding practices not only safeguards operational integrity but also ensures the protection of personnel and adherence to regulatory standards."

Besides, as one of the most critical modules in the radio-frequency (RF) chain, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) hold significant importance. To find that tradeoff, mixed-ADC architecture, combining high-resolution ADCs and low-resolution ADCs, emerges as an effective approach. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage near maximum likelihood (nML) detector to perform signal detection for the mixed architecture. In the first step, high-resolution ADCs are exploited to roughly find the transmitted signal vector. Subsequently, a convex optimization problem is further constructed based on the rough vector and projection gradient method is used to estimate the more likely one. An approximate expression for the cumulative distribution function is derived to simplify the optimization problem. Finally, the size of the transmitted signal vector collection is effectively minimized on the basis of the most possible vector and exhaustive search is carried out on the collection. Numerical results show that the proposed three-stage nML detector is efficient enough to simultaneously obtain high accuracy and low complexity."

This paper proposes a control structure to improve the performance of corner module vehicle path tracking through rear-wheel steering and differential steering, which can realize the switching and cooperation of these two functions. By analyzing the energy cost and the trajectory costs, the Pareto optimal solution of the controller parameter is found to realize the multiple objective optimization in the steering process. The simulation results of CarSim/Simulink show that the coordinated steering method performs better than rear steering and differential steering in energy saving while achieving satisfying trajectory performance."

However, CP often suffers from misaligned observations caused by localization inaccuracies and detection uncertainties, especially under bandwidth-constrained conditions. To address these challenges, we propose UA-MCS, an uncertainty-aware maximum common subgraph extraction framework for robust multi-agent perception. UA-MCS selectively transmits high-confidence detections while attaching compact features to low-confidence ones. By formulating the matching task as a min-max quadratic assignment problem (MM-QAP) and solving it with concave-convex optimization, UA-MCS achieves reliable alignment of detection results across agents, greatly enhancing perception accuracy under uncertainty. Meanwhile, the selective transmission mechanism substantially reduces communication overhead. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets show that UA-MCS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under varying localization noise, while outperforming prior methods in perception-communication trade-offs."

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels at general image segmentation but has limited ability to understand natural language, which restricts its direct application in Referring Expression Segmentation (RES). Toward this end, we propose SSP-SAM, a framework that fully utilizes SAM’s segmentation capabilities by integrating a Semantic-Spatial Prompt (SSP) encoder. Specifically, we incorporate both visual and linguistic attention adapters into the SSP encoder, which highlight salient objects within the visual features and discriminative phrases within the linguistic features. This design enhances the referent representation for the prompt generator, resulting in high-quality SSPs that enable SAM to generate precise masks guided by language. Although not specifically designed for Generalized RES (GRES), where the referent may correspond to zero, one, or multiple objects, SSP-SAM naturally supports this more flexible setting without additional modifications. Extensive experiments on widely used RES and GRES benchmarks confirm the superiority of our method. Notably, our approach generates segmentation masks of high quality, achieving strong precision even at strict thresholds such as Pr@0.9. Further evaluation on the PhraseCut dataset demonstrates improved performance in open-vocabulary scenarios compared to existing state-of-the-art RES methods.

    "abstract": "This work presents a deep learning-based inverse design framework for rapid prototyping of fork antennas operating within the ultra-wideband (UWB) frequency. By integrating a pre-trained frozen forward model into the inverse training process, the proposed method with forward consistency loss ensures that predicted antenna geometries yield physically valid performance metrics. Three models were trained: Deep Neural Network (DNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Echo State Network (ESN), to map performance targets to antenna dimensions. The results show that the models trained with forward consistency loss achieve a lower error in return loss, bandwidth, and frequency metrics. The proposed framework considering both forward loss and reverse loss outperforms inverse-only models, especially in complex high-frequency wideband scenarios. DNN and LSTM models demonstrated the best generalization at 3.5 GHz and 8 GHz, while all models significantly reduced the computational cost of antenna design compared to conventional simulation sweeps."

    "abstract": "Accurate and rapid state-of-health (SOH) monitoring plays an important role in indicating energy information for lithium-ion battery-powered portable mobile devices. To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this article proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semisupervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic autonomous air vehicles (AAVs) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{3}$</tex-math></inline-formula> LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root-mean-square error."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an expectation maximization sample transfer identification (EM-STI) algorithm to address the parameter identification problem in dynamic systems with non-ideal data. Traditional identification methods usually require a large amount of high-quality ideal data that follows the same distribution. However, in industrial measurement scenarios, challenges such as sensor noise, environmental complexity, and sensor data loss often make such datasets difficult to obtain. To solve the above problems, the EM-STI algorithm constructs a transfer identification framework, and models the distribution discrepancy between the source and target systems as latent variables, and iteratively optimizes parameters using the expectation maximization algorithm to improve the reliability and accuracy of the model. The core of the algorithm includes establishing a unified probabilistic framework, explicitly modeling distribution differences as latent variables, inferring the latent variable relationships through the expectation step, calculating the log-likelihood expectation, and updating the parameters in the maximization step to reduce distribution discrepancy. The algorithm also provides a theoretical guarantee of convergence. The simulation experiments on the mass-spring-damping system and the pH process system, as well as the industrial case study on the demand prediction of magnesium furnaces, have proved that this algorithm has excellent estimation accuracy under non-ideal data conditions such as high noise and data scarcity, and has strong robustness against non-Gaussian noise."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved significant success in wireless communications systems due to their denoising capabilities. The broadcast nature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise, but also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can effectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems. In this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and interference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent estimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an interference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint posterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference, along with the channel transition probability. The log-gradients of these distributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately estimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with advanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference cancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces the mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes without ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB and improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.

The mean scores of IPQ items demonstrated that such devastating event is particularly effective in enhancing participants’ involvement and sense of presence within the virtual environment, reinforcing the potential of VR to foster pro-environmental attitudes. Results also highlighted that these feelings were not altered by VR familiarity, whereas presence ratings were higher for participants who visited the actual location that the virtual environment replicated. Correlation analysis also discovered significant relationships between subjective and objective parameters."

    "abstract": "During the drying process of tobacco shreds, the moisture content of tobacco shreds is an important factor affecting product quality. Aiming at the nonlinearity, uncertainty and hysteresis of the drying process itself, it is difficult to achieve precise control of the moisture content of tobacco shreds. Accurately predicting the moisture content helps to control product quality. Therefore, this paper proposes a prediction model that combines the NRBO algorithm and the GRU algorithm neural network. NRBO is used to optimize the initial learning rate, hidden nodes, and regularization coefficient of the GRU model. Then, the optimized network hyperparameters are substituted into the GRU for learning and training. Finally, the moisture content of tobacco shreds at the outlet in the future is predicted. The model is experimentally compared with the LSTM, GRU, and NRBO-LSTM models, and the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2) are used as evaluation criteria. The results show that the NRBO-GRU model has a smaller error, higher precision, and more stable numerical fluctuations."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is set to transform data transmission and real-time sensing in sixth-generation (6G) networks. By offering high capacity, free-space optical (FSO) links can play a vital role as a backhaul solution, complementing radio frequency (RF) technologies such as millimeter wave (mmWave) to enhance 6G reliability. While adverse weather conditions such as fog can reduce the reliability of FSO links due to atmospheric attenuation, the back-scattered light it generates may also enable real-time sensing of atmospheric channel gain at the transmitter. This paper proposes a novel user offloading scheme utilizing an optical ISAC (O-ISAC) framework within a single-cell network, supported by a ground base station (GBS) and enhanced by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV connects to the gateway via an FSO backhaul link, estimating the channel gain based on back-scattered light and dynamically optimizing its position to efficiently offload users in the downlink. Numerical results demonstrate the UAV’s effectiveness in optimizing its position under various weather conditions and show that the proposed deployment scheme outperforms existing UAV offloading methods. The framework is evaluated using a real dataset of hourly visibility measurements in Edinburgh, underscoring the significance of optical channel sensing for overall system performance and providing insights into how sensing impacts communication efficiency."

Two different scenarios are considered, with single and multiple DF relays. Moreover, the average error rate is analyzed for the proposed system considering the two different scenarios. Our results indicate that the overall performance in the case of a single DF relay is governed by the performance of the second hop. Also, results reveal that a significant gain can be attained if a single relay is assigned to each user rather than one relay for all users."

A deep-learning pose model was fine-tuned on a bespoke infrared key-point dataset, and three motion-quantification filters were evaluated: raw differencing (Method A), center-aligned suppression (Method B), and a newly proposed skeleton template-matching filter (Method C). Tests on a life-sized neonatal mannequin confirmed centimetric joint-localization accuracy, reliable detection of 50-pixel hand displacements, and reduction of simulated camera-shake artifacts to within five pixels. Building on these results, a follow-up evaluation on pre-term neonates showed that Method C suppressed static key-point noise by 78 % while preserving physiological motion. This combined mannequin and in-vivo evidence demonstrates the clinical feasibility of our infrared digital-twin framework and establishes a foundation for automated assessment of pre-term motor development."

Several phenomena unique to DC interruption are identified, and practical design strategies are proposed to enhance the performance and reliability of DC switching devicesFirst, a sufficient number of splitter plates is necessary to generate an arc voltage that exceeds the system voltage, thereby enabling effective current interruption. Second, enhanced insulation, particularly around the arc quenching chamber, is crucial to prevent dielectric breakdown, especially under conditions of elevated arc voltage and the emission of high-temperature gases from the chamber. Third, minimizing both the opening time and contact rebound is essential to improve the current-limiting effect and accelerate arc extinction. Furthermore, under low-current operating conditions, increasing the number of arcing contacts enhances interruption reliability by forming multiple parallel arc branches, which help distribute arc energy more effectively."

Second, we assess the generalizability of the proposed method by conducting within-subject validation and cross-subject validation using models trained on the data from multiple subjects. The results indicate that increasing the number of the channels generally improves prediction performance, and the trained model of multiple subjects can compensate for lack of data per individual to achieve feasible prediction accuracy.

Our \"transparent hand\" feature solves the problem of text and diagrams being blocked by the instructor’s hand while writing, and \"frame pauses\" allows us to display a still frame and proceed with writing without showing viewers temporary-hidden content, such as the answers to exercises. The \"restore frames\" displays saved frames of the transparent hand and the current one, allowing us to switch between saved frames and reducing the time the instructor waits for all students to finish taking notes before changing pages. From the results of user experiments, the system was found to be effective in reducing the time required for viewers to finish taking notes by 33–42%. The proposed method was positively rated by the participants in terms of the hand transparency function and system usability."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for adaptive connectivity in future sixth-generation (6G) networks, offering high mobility, flexible deployment, and enhanced line-of-sight coverage. However, the open nature of wireless communication and the elevated positioning of UAVs as a relay expose them to severe security threats, including jamming and eavesdropping. In this work, we propose a secure downlink communication framework where a UAV relay flying at a fixed altitude serves multiple ground users while contending with an active jammer and a passive eavesdropper. To enhance physical layer security, we jointly optimize the UAV’s trajectory and transmit power over a discrete time horizon to maximize the cumulative secrecy rate. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved using both a successive convex approximation (SCA) method and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Simulation results demonstrate the optimized trajectories in various user topologies and shed light on the relationship between secrecy energy efficiency and maximal transmit power of the UAV relay as well as the number of users."

Non-individualized HRTFs may cause perceptual incongruity in some listeners; however, such incongruity can be overcome through training that leverages human adaptability. This study aims to improve adaptation to non-individualized HRTFs and proposes a new training method that combines auditory and visual information. The experimental results confirmed a tendency for reduced confusion rates when training with visual information in both anechoic and short-reverberant environments."

However, in smart factories, conventional systems often tightly couple hardware and software, resulting in limited scalability and inefficient resource utilization. In this study, we propose SPHERE (Service-oriented Platform with High-performance, Elastic, and Resilient Edge-enabled solutions), a reconfigurable edge-distributed processing platform based on container virtualization technology. SPHERE decouples software from hardware, enabling flexible deployment and efficient use of heterogeneous edge resources. We implemented a prototype system consisting of seven components and constructed three types of services: scratch detection, shape validation, and motion detection. Experimental validation demonstrated that modules can be shared across multiple services and dynamically recomposed to form different services. These results highlight the modularity and flexibility of SPHERE in dynamic factory environments."

Evaluation experiments confirmed that the sound images constructed by the proposed method were aligned with the video image, which caused no perceptual inconsistencies."

    "abstract": "Steady-State somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEPs) are event-related potentials in brain elicited by periodic vibrotactile stimulation to various body sites such as fingers and knees. Brain-Computer interfaces based on SSSEP (SSSEP-BCIs) use amplitude modulation of SSSEP elicited by selective attention to tactile stimuli with different frequencies to decode user intent for the interaction with external environment. Conventional SSSEP-BCIs have typically relied solely on mechanical stimulation. However, the limited perceptual distinctiveness among these stimuli reduces the attentional engagement in the selective attention task, resulting in insufficient amplitude modulation and degrading classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel SSSEP-BCI paradigm that combines mechanical and electrical stimulation to enhance the stimulus discriminability. Eight healthy participants were instructed to selectively attend to one of three stimuli--two mechanical stimuli applied to the index finger and the back of the knee and one electrical stimulus to the contralateral index finger to elicit the amplitude modulation of SSSEP. Using the common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and the support vector machine (SVM) for classification of the feature extracted, the proposed BCI achieved the maximum classification accuracy of 86.7% for three-class tasks and 76.3% for four-class tasks, demonstrating significant improvement over conventional SSSEP-BCI approaches."

Within the framework of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks, mobile AIGC services present numerous advantages over conventional cloud-based solutions, notably enhanced network efficiency and enhanced data security and privacy. However, the implementation of AIGC services often demands significant resources, leading to challenges for Roadside Units (RSUs) in managing information uncertainty and effectively addressing all user service requests without compromising overall system performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a multi-to-multi contract-based incentive mechanism for AIGC services within vehicle edge computing. This approach leverages contract theory to design an optimal contractual framework between Mobile AIGC Service Providers (MASPs) and vehicles. We present the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving an optimal contract and explore the simplification of the associated constraints. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively provides incentives and outperforms existing benchmark schemes."

    "abstract": "With the emergence of the metaverse and its role in enabling real-time simulation and analysis of real-world counterparts, an increasing number of personalized metaverse scenarios are being created to influence entertainment experiences and social behaviors. However, compared to traditional image and video entertainment applications, the exact transmission of the vast amount of metaverse-associated information significantly challenges the capacity of existing bit-oriented communication networks. Moreover, the current metaverse also witnesses a growing goal shift for transmitting the meaning behind custom-designed content, such as user-designed buildings and avatars, rather than exact copies of physical objects. To meet this growing goal shift and bandwidth challenge, this paper proposes a goal-oriented semantic communication framework for metaverse application (GSCM) to explore and define semantic information through the goal levels. Specifically, we first analyze the traditional image communication framework in metaverse construction and then detail our proposed semantic information along with the end-to-end wireless communication. We then describe the designed modules of the GSCM framework, including goal-oriented semantic information extraction, base knowledge definition, and neural radiance field (NeRF) based metaverse construction. Finally, numerous experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that, compared to image communication, our proposed GSCM framework decreases transmission latency by up to 92.6% and enhances the virtual object operation accuracy and metaverse construction clearance by up to 45.6% and 44.7%, respectively."

    "abstract": "This work presents a water-substrate-based conformal implantable antenna (WSCIA) designed for Industrial Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) applications. The antenna exhibits ultra-wideband (UWB) characteristics across the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical bands at 915 MHz and 2400 MHz, enabling efficient wireless power transfer and high-data-rate biotelemetry. It achieves a bandwidth of 510 MHz (0.71–1.23 GHz) in the 915 MHz band and 1.30 GHz (1.80–3.10 GHz) in the 2400 MHz band. The antenna exhibits strong radiation stability in varying tissue environments, ensuring reliable performance under realistic implantation conditions. Measured peak realized gains are –24.87 dBi at 915 MHz and –22.03 dBi at 2400 MHz, with corresponding radiation efficiencies of 0.76% and 0.80%. The specific absorption rate (SAR) analysis using an anatomically realistic human model confirms compliance with safety guidelines. Link margin and received power analyses confirm reliable telemetric communication at distances beyond 10 m for 915 MHz and 5 m for 2400 MHz, supporting high data rates of up to 120 Mb/s. Owing to the dielectric similarity between water and human tissue, the proposed WSCIA enables efficient electromagnetic (EM) energy transfer and, through 3D printing, offers a lightweight and cost-effective alternative to traditional substrate-based antenna designs. Collectively, the dual-UWB performance, radiation stability, low SAR, compact design, and frequency tunability make the proposed WSCIA a promising solution for next-generation IIoMT-based implants. Furthermore, its structural flexibility and stable EM performance in diverse environments make it suitable for anatomically constrained regions, particularly the scalp, heart, and gastrointestinal tract, where reliable wireless communication and safe long-term implantation are critical."

    "abstract": "Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) are key indicators for monitoring rice growth dynamics. While UAV-based hyperspectral data is widely used, its high redundancy poses challenges for efficient information extraction. To address this, we propose a two-step generic framework. First, synthetic spectra generated by a field-constrained PROSAIL model are used to train a one-dimensional convolutional neural network with a self-attention mechanism that derives Spectral Composite Variables (SCVs) from redundant hyperspectral data. Then, the SCVs are combined with canopy temperature (from thermal infrared sensors) and crop height (derived from UAV-based LiDAR and RGB imagery) to develop a retrieval model, validated through both within-site and cross-site strategies. Results showed that the SCVs generated exhibited strong correlations with LAI and LCC, averaging 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. Moreover, the proposed framework achieved high retrieval accuracy across all growth stages (e.g., booting, heading, filling), with mean R² values of 0.76 for LAI and 0.71 for LCC. Specifically, both estimations reached peak performance during the heading stage, with an R² of 0.83 and RMSE of 0.47 m²/m² for LAI, and an R² of 0.77 and RMSE of 4.13 μg/cm² for LCC. Cross-site validation confirmed the model’s robustness and transferability, with the best performance consistently observed during the heading stage. Benefiting from this framework, spatial predictions of LAI and LCC at centimeter-level resolution closely aligned with observed patterns, enabling precise monitoring of rice growth. Overall, this study presents a robust and transferable solution for overcoming hyperspectral redundancy and enhancing crop growth estimation accuracy."

In this study, we propose a novel registration method that uses a neural network to detect high-precision planar regions, followed by alignment based solely on these planes.

In contrast, our method probes for fragile concepts and generates continuous counterfactual images along concept axes without original data, enabling targeted robustness enhancement. We fine-tune only the classification head of a pretrained ResNet-50 with approximately 4k slider images. This achieves HardImageNet accuracy gains comparable to editing-based retraining, without original images or complex pipelines."

To address the challenge of limited and sparse source data, our model realizes the effective fusion of dynamic and static information by sharing the dynamic flow information with significant time series gradient changes and static distribution information, significantly improving the prediction performance and strengthening the representation and adaptability to complex working conditions. Experiments based on real production data show that the proposed method can achieve a refined prediction of future logistics status."

The framework dynamically adapts to unify the 5G and Wi-Fi access technologies.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed policies, we compare them against the on-policy Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and off-policy Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) methods. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the on-policy algorithms achieve superior performance in terms of slice acceptance ratios and resource utilization, highlighting their potential to enhance slice deployment in future heterogeneous networks beyond 5G and into 6G."

Participants engaged in a gesture-based charade game under varying packet loss conditions, alternating between gesture-only (Mimer) and audioenabled (Guesser) roles. Early results from 28 sessions (14 per platform) indicate a noticeable degradation in audiovisual experience as packet loss increases, particularly for gesture-based users. Microsoft Teams demonstrated greater resilience compared to Google Meet, although these findings remain exploratory. The study lays the groundwork for a more comprehensive Quality of Experience (QoE) evaluation. Future work will include additional participants and integrate metrics such as Simulator Sickness (SSQ), NASA TLX, and Quality of Interaction (QoI) to support a fuller assessment of conferencing feasibility in immersive settings."

However, the suitability of recent You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures for real-time surveillance scenarios remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a performance analysis of YOLOv9c and YOLOv10n architectures for object detection in surveillance videos in real-time. The models were evaluated on the VIRAT video surveillance dataset containing a diverse collection of surveillance footage, with objects ranging from pedestrians and vehicles to other moving entities. Quantitative and qualitative metrics, including mAP, precision, recall, and accuracy, were considered to assess their effectiveness. Our analysis reveals that YOLOv9c outperforms YOLOv10n in accuracy and detection robustness, while YOLOv10n demonstrates superior performance in terms of computational efficiency, making it a better choice for systems with hardware constraints. These findings provide valuable insights into selecting YOLO architectures tailored to real-time surveillance applications."

Displaying motion cues is a promising approach but needs more than accelerometer data to indicate the orientation to alleviate or even eliminate the symptoms of motion sickness. Another common user experience shortcoming is wind noise outdoors or while riding on a bike, which makes telephone communication almost impossible. Bone conduction microphones are known for harsh environments. The challenge for consumer electronics is the integration in miniaturized earables and with good audio capturing quality. This paper examines how advanced inertial MEMS sensors and sensor fusion techniques can address these challenges, presenting practical implementation examples."

Unlike the prior modulation technologies, multiple influence factors including he constellation mapping, the number of spatial layers, layer mapping and power allocation among spatial layers are simultaneously taken into account in the proposed method pursuing for spectral efficiency maximization via auto-encoder (AE) model. In this paper, a joint optimization subject to influence factors above for the cross-layer modulation is fulfilled based on the AE framework for simplifying the design complexity and achieving a better performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the block error rate (BLER) performance of the proposed cross-layer modulation is beyond the traditional scheme by around 1 dB as a result of the learned bit-symbol mapping for spatial layers."

Since DeepJSCC delivers task-related data without encryption, the risks of signal interception and reverse inference increase.

Recently, State-Space Model (SSM), a state-of-the-art time-series machine learning model, has attracted attention in sequential recommendation modeling. SSM-based sequential recommendation models can effectively capture long-term user preferences, but modeling short-term dependencies is difficult. In this paper, we propose a new sequential recommendation model, which complements the short-term dependencies of SSM-based models in two aspects: item adjacencies and time intervals. To capture the adjacency between items, a graph structure is constructed from the sequences, and the time interval between items is captured in the time-aware SSM layer. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation models."

    "abstract": "Lightning represents a critical atmospheric hazard, with direct and indirect injury mechanisms well-established in the literature. Currently, six mechanisms are recognized (five direct and one indirect), to which all officially recorded fatalities are ascribed. However, this study highlights that additional deaths occur from secondary effects, such as fires, failures in essential services (e.g., electrical power), and panic in mass gatherings, triggered by electrical discharges. Such fatalities, although linked to lightning as a primary cause, remain underreported due to a lack of proper classification. The application of eligibility criteria in the Scopus database revealed 302 publications by the end of 2023. Of these, 57 fully satisfied the inclusion criteria. The analysis revealed significant underreporting of fatalities associated with secondary effects, reinforcing the gap in existing classifications. The absence of formal categorization for these cases compromises statistical accuracy, impacting risk assessment and public policy formulation. The results highlight the need to expand classification systems to include secondary effects, ensuring a more accurate representation of lightning’s societal impact. This restructuring will facilitate the development of more effective protection guidelines, safety standards, and prevention mechanisms. The study concludes that integrating these factors into official statistics is crucial for mitigating risks and saving lives, providing a technical basis for advancements in public safety and disaster management."

    "abstract": "Despite the success of Gaussian process based Model Predictive Control (MPC), its applicability scope is greatly hindered by multimodal disturbances that are prevalent in real-world settings. Here we propose a novel Mixture of Gaussian Processes based Distributionally Robust MPC (MoGP-DR-MPC) framework for linear time-invariant systems subject to potentially multimodal state-dependent disturbances. This framework utilizes MoGP to automatically determine the number of modes from disturbance data. Using the mean and variance information provided by each mode-specific predictive distribution, it constructs a data-driven state-dependent ambiguity set, which allows for flexible and fine-grained disturbance modeling. Based on this ambiguity set, we impose Distributionally Robust Conditional Value-at-Risk (DR-CVaR) constraints to effectively achieve distributional robustness against errors in the predictive distributions. To address the computational challenge posed by these constraints in the resulting MPC problem, we equivalently reformulate the DR-CVaR constraints into tractable second-order cone constraints. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed framework. The enhanced control performance of MoGP-DR-MPC is validated through both numerical experiments and simulations on a quadrotor system, demonstrating notable reductions in closed-loop cost by 17% and 4% respectively compared against Gaussian process based MPC."

To overcome these challenges, a flexible FC scheme is proposed in this paper. It achieves reference tracking with the predefined accuracy and settling time under any initial condition of the closed-loop system, despite the totally unknown nonlinearities and the unmatched disturbances. The strategy eliminates the requirements for parameter identification, function approximation, derivative calculation and disturbance estimation, and shows a control simplicity. The above theoretical results are verified by a experiment on a serial flexible link robotic manipulator."

    "abstract": "Trustworthy communication is essential for the success of sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling seamless and reliable interactions across diverse connected Internet of things (IoT) devices and systems. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play a pivotal role in this ecosystem by facilitating low-latency communication and promoting efficient resource utilization through flexible deployment strategies. In this context, we propose a trust-driven framework for UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC). Initially, UAVs are deployed using the K-means clustering algorithm to maximize coverage. We then formulate an optimization problem that simultaneously targets several conflicting objectives: (i) maximize the trust level of serving UAVs; (ii) minimize computational latency for IoT devices tasks; (iii) maximize the number of served IoT devices; and (iv) balance the trade-off between maximizing trust and minimizing service provisioning cost. UAV trustworthiness is modeled as a composite metric encompassing success rate, security score, communication stability, computational resource availability, and energy sufficiency. To solve this problem, we develop a penalty-guided optimization (PGO) algorithm that guides relaxed binary decision variables toward integer solutions, followed by refinement using sequential quadratic programming. Simulations demonstrate that the PGO algorithm outperforms baseline relaxation methods and achieves performance close to the optimal branch-and-bound approach, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Additionally, unequally weighted trust metrics yield better UAV trust levels as compared to equal weighting, highlighting the advantage of adaptive trust modeling. The proposed UAV trust evaluation framework and deployment strategy thus collectively lead to enhanced network accessibility, reliability, and utility in aerial IoT networks."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for data usage in wireless communications requires using wider bands in the spectrum, especially for backhaul links. Yet, allocations in the spectrum for non-communication systems inhibit merging bands to achieve wider bandwidth. To overcome this issue, spectrum-sharing or opportunistic spectrum utilization by secondary users stands out as a promising solution. However, both approaches must minimize interference to primary users. Therefore, spectrum sensing becomes vital for such opportunistic usage, ensuring the proper operation of the primary users. Although this problem has been investigated for two-dimensional networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks need different approaches concerning three-dimensional space, its challenges, and opportunities. For this purpose, we propose a federated learning (FL)-based method for spectrum sensing in UAV networks to account for their distributed nature and limited computational capacity. FL enables local training without sharing raw data while guaranteeing the privacy of local users, lowering communication overhead, and increasing data diversity. Furthermore, we develop a federated aggregation method, namely FedSNR, that considers the signal-to-noise ratio observed by UAVs to acquire a global model. The numerical results show that the proposed architecture and the aggregation method outperform traditional methods."

To address this gap, especially within the SME framework, we build on the concept of IT/OT convergence, by proposing a novel security approach based on the integration of lightweight hardware security primitives into OT hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to examine the feasibility of combining the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) in the context of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)."

The reward function in the RL framework is carefully designed to simultaneously minimize tracking errors, promote motion smoothness, and enforce collision avoidance. Beyond policy optimization through RL, a two-step real-time trajectory blending (RTB) scheme, consisting of a Butterworth filter (BF) and polynomial interpolation, is developed to further refine the generated trajectories and ensure smooth joint velocity profiles. Furthermore, the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is employed for policy learning, and the performance is compared with two widely used methods, namely proximal policy optimization (PPO) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3). Experimental results on a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) robot manipulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving safe and smooth visual servoing in real time."

Rapid and accurate building damage assessment (BDA) on remote sensing images is crucial for disaster response and recovery. However, most methods are constructed on the ideal co-registered bitemporal remote sensing images, neglecting the misalignment in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel building damage assessment method, termed FlowMamba, which can effectively handle the offset between the pre- and post-disaster images in BDA task. Specifically, a vision mamba backbone with four stages is utilized to extract multi scale features from the pre- and post-disaster images. Then, a differential optical flow alignment module is designed to estimate shift matrix to align pre- and post-disaster features. Furthermore, a category distance-aware loss function is tailored for the BDA task, which replaces fixed binary values of the penalty factors in to soft values of inter-class distance. Extensive experiments on the xBD dataset, the BRIGHT dataset and four out-of-distribution disaster scenarios validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed FlowMamba.

    "abstract": "Muscle synergies, defined as coordinated activations of muscle groups, are thought to simplify motor control by reducing dimensionality and providing a repertoire of adaptable motor solutions. While prior research has investigated synergy adaptation in clinical populations and healthy individuals, most evidence stems from constrained or low-degree-of-freedom (DOF) tasks. A critical gap remains in understanding how synergies are refined in high-DOF, performance-driven contexts that demand full-body coordination. To address this, we examined neuromuscular strategies in professional and amateur golfers performing a 7-iron swing. Electromyographic recordings from 27 muscles, along with kinematic and kinetic data, were analyzed to identify kinematic predictors of clubhead speed and their associated muscle activation patterns. Muscle synergy and clustering analysis of these key muscles revealed two group-invariant synergies, pelvis rotation and plantarflexion, whose peak activation timings were significantly correlated with clubhead speed. A significant subject-specific synergy and a significant amateur-exclusive synergy further highlighted how adaptation involves both individualized tuning and filtering of suboptimal strategies. These findings suggest that expert performance in complex, high-DOF tasks relies on temporal refinement of existing synergies rather than structural reorganization, highlighting the importance of managing, rather than minimizing, motor complexity in the acquisition of advanced motor skills. Furthermore, our approach for identifying neuromuscular patterns linked to performance outcomes provides a foundation for targeted training interventions aimed at enhancing or restoring complex movement patterns."

The humidity sensitive characteristic of the QCM sensor is investigated in various relative humidity (RH). The experimental result indicates that the Nafion/CNC exhibits excellent sensitivity, slight humidity hysteresis (ca. 4.3%), good repeatability and high stability. Among them, the sensitivity of Nafion/CNC (ca. 48.43 Hz/RH) is higher than that of CNC (ca. 1.31 times) and Nafion (ca. 1.43 times). The humidity sensitive mechanism of Nafion/CNC is also discussed by the Langmuir isothermal adsorption model. Meanwhile, the structure and morphology of the synthesized products are analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Additionally, the Nafion/CNC humidity sensor has been applied for respiration monitoring, demonstrating good potential for application."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the metaverse has led to a scattered ecosystem in which digital assets are deployed on different blockchain platforms. This disintegration creates significant challenges for interoperability, as users need secure, decentralized, and privacy-preserving protocols to enable interoperability between chains. Existing solutions typically depend on centralized exchanges or third-party relays, introducing a single point of failure and potential privacy risks. We propose MAM (Metaverse Asset Management), a novel user-centric protocol utilizing zkSNARK technology (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) that enables seamless movement of metaverse assets across various blockchain platforms. MAM’s architecture ensures privacy by generating all zkSNARK proofs locally on the user’s machine, ensuring that sensitive data, including private keys and asset metadata, never leave the device. The protocol employs a secure one-time setup to distribute the global circuit-specific proving key, ensuring the permanent destruction of toxic-waste data. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that MAM achieves a constant and minimal proof size (192 bytes), low gas cost (281,107 Gas per verification), and an end-to-end asset transfer latency under 15 seconds, outperforming recent alternatives such as MetaOpera and MAP. Static security analysis confirms the robustness of MAM’s smart contracts against the most significant vulnerability types. This research enhances the state-of-the-art of privacy-preserving and scalable cross-metaverse interoperability, providing a practical approach for fully decentralized digital asset management and transfer across the Metaverse."

    "abstract": "The issue of inadequate infrared recognition accuracy for substation equipment is addressed in this paper through the proposal of the IDSE-YOLO model, a high-precision infrared recognition model for substation equipment. The primary goal of this study is to improve recognition accuracy in complex backgrounds and low-resolution scenarios. It incorporates Dual Depthwise Convolution (DDConv) and Multi-scale Efficient Channel Attention (MECA) to enhance computational capabilities and feature extraction efficiency. Additionally, a multi-scale loss function is designed with optimised regression loss, enabling precise target identification. Experimental results, based on proprietary datasets, show that the enhanced model demonstrates substantial improvements in key performance metrics such as Precision (P), Recall (R), and Mean Average Precision (mAP), when compared to existing models. Notably, a comparison with the baseline YOLOv13 model reveals that the IDSE-YOLO model achieves an mAP of 95.3%, marking a 5.5% improvement, without a significant increase in computational load or parameter overhead. The model’s deployment on edge devices for on-site image recognition further demonstrates its efficacy and practicality. The findings validate the IDSE-YOLO model as a highly effective and viable solution for deploying infrared recognition systems for substation equipment on embedded devices, offering a significant boost in recognition accuracy."

    "abstract": "Retro-reflective optical wireless systems provide a compelling solution for passive uplink in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. However, supporting practical uplink concurrency is hindered by two fundamental challenges: the limited operational range of modulated retro reflectors (MRRs) and the severe inter-tag uplink interference which becomes particularly severe in near–far scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a system that achieves spatial division multiple access (SDMA) by co-designing a hybrid retro-reflector architecture with a successive interference can cellation (SIC)-based signal processing framework. The hybrid design on each tag integrates an unmodulated retro-reflector (URR) for ranging with an MRR that embeds an on-off keying (OOK) ID. At the receiver, our SIC framework leverages the distinct time delays from spatially diverse tags to resolve signal superposition, successfully recovering weaker, previously masked signals. We validate this approach through high-fidelity simulations parameterized by experimental data from a custom built, high-power optical test bed. Simulation results validate the concept, demonstrating simultaneous ranging and communication for two concurrent tags; the system achieves centimeter level ranging accuracy at a 5-meter range while maintaining a communication uplink of several hundred hertz per tag at a bit-error rate below 10−3. Crucially, our analysis provides a comprehensive characterization of the system's performance bottlenecks, establishing the fundamental trade-off between light source bandwidth and the achievable tag concurrency."

    "abstract": "As the frequency of cyber attacks (e.g., DDoS) continues to rise, it becomes increasingly crucial to trace malicious packets and identify which autonomous systems (ASes) they originate from and traverse through. Path-aware networking (PAN) architectures, forwarding packets based on in-packet path identifiers (PIDs), enable end-hosts to gain insights into the AS-level topology and facilitate AS-level path traceback. However, the study on AS-level topology inference and path traceback under PAN has been overlooked, primarily due to the diversity of path identification. Some PAN architectures (e.g., SCION) use deterministic PIDs to identify inter-domain paths, while others (e.g., CoLoR) adopt prefix-deterministic PIDs. In the latter, PID-Prefix is used to identify inter-domain paths, and PID-Suffix is reserved for additional security functions, making the inference problem complicated. This paper focuses on PAN with prefix-deterministic PIDs and investigates how to use in-packet PIDs to infer the AS-level topology. Our goal is to construct a tree-like AS-level topology with the corresponding PID-Prefixes based on in-packet PIDs. We first introduce two macro metrics (i.e., completion rate and precision rate) and two micro metrics (i.e., traceback division and traceback aggregation) to evaluate the inference accuracy. Furthermore, we propose an Alternating Expanding and Checking (AEC) algorithm for AS-level topology inference. AEC algorithm constructs the topology by iteratively expanding and checking the current topology. The expanding phase performs one-hop PID-Prefix inference and generates new child ASes, while the checking phase verifies the consistency of PID sequences with the current topology from the perspective of each new child AS. Experiments based on empirical Internet topology of 201 ASes show that the accuracy of AEC reaches 99.6% when the observer receives only 30 packets from each AS."

    "abstract": "Double patch clamp technique, using two micropipette electrodes to patch and measure electrophysiological signals of two neurons, is essential for investigating the functional connections between neurons in brain. However, the interactive mechanical disturbances from the dual-micropipette motions inside viscoelastic brain tissue cause dynamic drifts of neurons, making double patching low efficiency and challenging. In this paper, an interactive mechanical modeling of two micropipettes approaching two cells in elastic environment was established to estimate the dynamic drift of the cells. Based on that, a synchronous descent strategy, an appropriate relative position of two cells, and an online trajectory plan of two micropipettes were determined to improve double patch clamp efficiency. Finally, a robotic double patch clamp operation process was established for functional connectivity measurement between neurons in brain slice. The effectiveness of the proposed work is validated through both finite element modeling and experiments. The double patch clamp experiments on neurons in visual cortex demonstrate that our method achieves a 40% improvement in success rate and a 38% improvement in speed in comparison to the traditional manual method. With the above advantages, diverse functional connectivity activities between neurons were found using our system, paving a solid ground for further research."

    "abstract": "Sepsis-induced brain dysfunction (SIBD), a critical determinant of mortality and long-term neurological sequelae in sepsis patients. The mechanistic understanding of SIBD has been limited by conventional single-modality approaches, which fail to capture the complex oxygenation-metabolism interplay. Here, we present an integrated photoacoustic-metabolomic platform that combines high-resolution photoacoustic imaging with targeted metabolomics to comprehensively assess cerebral oxygenation and metabolic alterations during sepsis. Our imaging system provides high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling mapping of key parameters, including cerebral oxygen saturation (sO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and the spatial heterogeneity of oxygen metabolism. By integrating these imaging capabilities with region-specific metabolomic profiling, we uncover a dynamic relationship between sepsis-driven oxygenation disruptions and metabolic reprogramming. Specifically, we demonstrate that sepsis induces heterogeneous cortical hypoxia, dysregulated OEF dynamics, and a metabolic shift marked by enhanced glycolysis and suppressed pentose phosphate pathway activity in high-OEF regions. This multimodal platform not only advances our understanding of the pathophysiology of SIBD but also offers a powerful tool for early diagnosis, personalized therapeutic strategies, highlighting the promise in bedside monitoring and precision medicine applications in sepsis management."

This design meets the workspace requirements for microvascular anastomosis, requiring extensive orientation adjustments with minimal positional movement and reducing the system footprint.

Theoretical analysis has been performed on both the RCM mechanism and motorized surgical instruments, and kinematics-based parameter optimization and data-driven calibration have been conducted to enhance superior performance. A prototype has been constructed, and its experimental validation demonstrated that the system achieved repeatability of 11.24 ± 2.31 μm (XY) and 12.46 ± 4.48 μm (YZ), and absolute positioning accuracy of 29.80 ± 12.27 μm (XY) and 37.02 ± 19.47 μm (YZ), meeting super-microsurgical requirements.

Compared to conventional NM designs, this design could significantly reduce the size of the matrix by using a regular hexagonal coupler. The six-port hybrid coupler is composed of two hexagons and a series of transmission lines connecting them. The power at each output port can be controlled by the impedance of the transmission lines. To verify this, two six-port couplers with the power division ratios of 1:1:1 and 1:2:1 are designed. The transmission coefficient of the first design is <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$5~\\pm ~0.38$</tex-math> </inline-formula> dB. The return loss exceeds 20 dB, while the amplitude and phase fluctuations are within 0.9 dB and 14°, respectively, across 2.28–2.61 GHz. In addition, the return loss and isolation of the second design are better than 13.6 dB, while isolation is greater than 15.8 dB across 2.3–2.6 GHz.

    "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of consumer electronics, transmitter identification faces growing challenges in open-set wireless environments. Conventional deep learning-based open-set specific emitter identification (OS-SEI) methods rely solely on in-distribution(ID) emitter signals, often resulting in over-confident classifiers and limited rejection of rogue emitters. To address this, we propose an OS-SEI framework that first employs a residual shrinkage network (RSN) to robustly extract radio frequency fingerprints under noisy conditions. To alleviate classifier overconfidence, an adaptive energy-based regularization dynamically adjusts decision boundaries using class prototypes and energy statistics maintained via exponential moving averages. Furthermore, class-wise representative out-of-distribution (OOD) sampling is applied to select hard samples for each class. Finally, a dual-head deviation network (DHDN) with a soft deviation loss jointly models explicit and implicit deviations and aggregates their scores, enhancing detection of subtle distributional shifts. Experiments on the WiSig and the DroneDetect datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in unknown transmitter rejection and overall robustness, making it well-suited for consumer electronics applications."

In both theory and experiments, we demonstrate that, in the absence of additional clean (i.e., without the implanted pseudo-clique) network data, this pairing of model and methods can yield worse results than the best existing spectral clique detection methods. However, these methods can be used to asymptotically localize the pseudo-cliques if additional clean, independent network data is provided. This demonstrates at once the methods' potential ability/inability to capture modestly sized pseudo-cliques and the methods' robustness to the model contamination giving rise to the pseudo-clique structure. To further enrich our analysis, we also consider the Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) model in our simulation and real data experiments."

We then evaluate essential QKD performance metrics—such as the quantum key rate, quantum bit error rate (QBER), and outage probability—across a wide range of beam waist sizes and tracking accuracies. Numerical simulations demonstrate how subtle increases in the pointing error variance can drastically reduce the secure key generation rate, particularly for tightly focused beams. These findings highlight the importance of precise pointing systems and careful selection of optical parameters to ensure an acceptable QBER and a sufficiently high secret key rate in inter-satellite QKD links."

    "abstract": "Sub-band full duplex (SBFD) operation, which enables simultaneous uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions over adjacent subbands, has been introduced as a promising duplexing technique for 6G and beyond. However, SBFD introduces cross-link interference (CLI), particularly between neighboring base stations (gNB-to-gNB), which can severely degrade uplink performance. Uniform UL resource muting algorithms have been proposed in the literature to make accurate CLI measurements for the effectiveness of gNB-to-gNB interference mitigation mechanisms. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and non-uniform UL resource muting scheme that dynamically adjusts the number and position of muted resource elements (REs) based on the estimated large-scale interference power distribution. Furthermore, we introduce a frequency-shaped adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) model to reflect realistic leakage behavior in SBFD networks. Simulation results show that non-uniform muting pattern (NuMP) outperforms uniform muting pattern (UMP) in terms of estimation performance, while also requiring fewer muted resource elements, as demonstrated by lower normalized mean square error (NMSE) values and reduced muting overhead."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which can exploit the wireless spectrum for concurrent sensing and communication functions, is regarded as a promising technology for the future sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks. This paper proposes a robust beam tracking method for maneuverable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with jittering effect within the ISAC framework. By utilizing reflected echoes, the kinematic parameters are measured and the interacting multiple model with extended Kalman filter (IMM-EKF) is designed for robust beam tracking of maneuverable UAVs. Furthermore, due to the jittering effect, the UAV may not point to the optimal alignment direction. To this end, we propose the coordinate descent particle swarm optimization (CDPSO) algorithm to balance the jittering effect by maximizing the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the UAV. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified via simulation results."

This study aims to address these challenges by introducing a user interface designed to promote active student participation. An application was developed that enables students to submit anonymous comments, which appear in real-time on a shared screen. An experimental evaluation confirmed a notable decrease in psychological burden. Participants reported an average burden score of 3.1 when using the system, in contrast to 7.8 when speaking directly, indicating a reduction of 4.7 points. The comment sharing system proved effective in lowering psychological barriers to participation and maintaining student motivation."

The core of the electric arc reaches a local thermal equilibrium (LTE) state, which primarily determines its behaviour. In contrast, the regions near the anode and cathode and outside the arc core are in a non-LTE condition. This work mainly discusses the modelling of the near-anode and near-cathode regions and the arc core.We use a magnetostatic approach to calculate the Joule heating loss and the Lorentz force within the arc. To model the regions near the anode and cathode, we introduce nonlinear conductivity dependent on current density to simulate voltage drops near the electrodes. The anode and cathode surface losses are then determined based on these voltage drops.Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to calculate the electrical conductivity and temperature of the arc at each iteration. Multi-species models that incorporate local species concentrations are used to account for metal and insulation vapor. Various thermal radiation models can be applied to improve the accuracy of electric arc simulations.High-performance computing (HPC) is used to meet computational demands and reduce simulation time.To validate the proposed simulation workflow, we focus on two benchmark cases and compare the simulated results with the experimental results from literature."

The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on informative views according to their importance. Furthermore, our novel loss function addresses class characteristics by focusing on hard-to-train examples and representing class labels as probability distributions. Experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed method."

To address this issue, this study proposes a voice recognition database primarily centered on the \"classification of similar-sounding words,\" identifying words that sound similar but have completely different meanings, and recording audio and classification data with native Chinese speakers. Through this database, language learners can intuitively understand the gap between their spoken pronunciation and the standard pronunciation based on the trained model, allowing for targeted pronunciation correction and reinforcement practice."

Considering the presence of CCI at both the communication users and sensing receiver as well as imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC), it presents accurate expressions for the communication performance in terms of the outage probability and ergodic communication rate, and the sensing performance in terms of the probabilities of false alarm and detection. The accuracy of the newly derived expressions is then verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. The results highlight the undesirable effects of error propagation from SIC imperfections, sensing interference (SI), and CCI in NOMA-ISAC communications systems. It is also demonstrated that in the high signal-to-noise regime, the sum communication rate reaches a limit due to inter-user interference, imperfect SIC, and SI."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for emerging vehicular services, such as immersive entertainment, safety applications, and enhanced infotainment, has driven the development of Vehicle-to-Everything communication. However, vehicular networks face significant challenges due to stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and the highly dynamic nature of wireless environments. Traditional Radio Access Network (RAN) architectures struggle to adapt to these conditions, necessitating more flexible and intelligent solutions. Open RAN, with its virtualised and intelligent architecture, offers a promising approach by incorporating Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for real-time network optimisation. This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) selection algorithm within an Open RAN-enabled vehicular network to optimise resource usage while ensuring QoS compliance. The proposed algorithm leverages the flexibility of Open RAN and the adaptability of DRL to dynamically configure MCS parameters, enhancing the Quality of Experience for users in challenging vehicular scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that the DRL-based approach reduces network resource usage by 33% compared to conventional SNR-based MCS selection while improving QoS satisfaction by approximately 5%."

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of networks and the variety of future scenarios with diverse and often stringent performance requirements call for a higher level of automation. Intent-based management emerges as a solution to attain high level of automation, enabling human operators to solely communicate with the network through high-level intents. The intents consist of the targets in the form of expectations (i.e., latency expectation) from a service and based on the expectations the required network configurations should be done accordingly. It is almost inevitable that when a network action is taken to fulfill one intent, it can cause negative impacts on the performance of another intent, which results in a conflict. In this paper, we address the challenge of conflict resolution in intent-based networking and propose an online learning approach based on the hierarchical multi-armed bandit framework for autonomous network management. The hierarchical structure enables efficient exploration and exploitation of network configurations while adapting to dynamic network conditions. Our proposed hierarchical multi-armed bandit conflict resolution (MABCR) approach optimizes resource allocation within a partially known system with limited bandwidth. In comparison to other approaches, we show that our algorithm is an effective approach regarding resource allocation and satisfaction of intent expectations."

    "abstract": "This paper studies a two-user downlink broadcast channel in which the base station receives short status-update packets for users under independent Bernoulli arrivals and broadcasts them over Rayleigh fading channels. Short packets are encoded using finite-blocklength codes, leading to a non-negligible packet error rate. We focus on the version age of information (VAoI) performance, defined as the difference between the version indices of the latest packets at the transmitter and the receiver. Two multiple access strategies are compared: (i) an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme, specifically time-division multiple access (TDMA), which serves at most one user per time slot using a VAoI-aware greedy scheduler; and (ii) a hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled scheme, which employs power-domain NOMA when the queues for both users are non-empty and reverts to OMA when only one queue is non-empty. Simulation results reveal that the OMA scheme achieves a lower average VAoI in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, while the NOMA-enabled scheme achieves a lower average VAoI in the high SNR regime. The performance difference between the two schemes is particularly high under high packet arrival rates. These insights provide practical guidelines for selecting multiple access schemes in VAoI-aware status-update systems."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing novel view synthesis (NVS) offers significant potential for 3D interpretation of remote sensing scenes, with important applications in urban planning and environmental monitoring. However, remote sensing scenes frequently lack sufficient multi-view images due to acquisition constraints. While existing NVS methods tend to overfit when processing limited input views, advanced few-shot NVS methods are computationally intensive and perform sub-optimally in remote sensing scenes. This paper presents TriDF, an efficient hybrid 3D representation for fast remote sensing NVS from as few as 3 input views. Our approach decouples color and volume density information, modeling them independently to reduce the computational burden on implicit radiance fields and accelerate reconstruction. We explore the potential of the triplane representation in few-shot NVS tasks by mapping high-frequency color information onto this compact structure, and the direct optimization of feature planes significantly speeds up convergence. Volume density is modeled as continuous density fields, incorporating reference features from neighboring views through image-based rendering to compensate for limited input data. Additionally, we introduce depth-guided optimization based on point clouds, which effectively mitigates the overfitting problem in few-shot NVS. Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing scenes demonstrate that our hybrid representation achieves a 30× speed increase compared to NeRF-based methods, while simultaneously improving rendering quality metrics over advanced few-shot methods (7.4% increase in PSNR and 3.4% in SSIM).

Nine cable-type specimens—seven 30 cm-long samples with 30 or 69 of 4 mm-wide REBCO tapes and two 100 cm-long samples with 104 and 106 of 12 mm-wide tapes—were manually fabricated using pre-cut long REBCO tapes to facilitate four point voltage measurements. Measured inter-tape resistivities ranged from 30 nΩ·m to 733 nΩ·m, with the best soldered stacks averaged 47 nΩ·m whereas the unsoldered and poorly soldered cases averaged 516 nΩ·m and 683 nΩ·m. A two-dimensional finite element model assuming perfectly aligned tapes and tunable sol der resistivity reproduced these trends, confirming the dominant role of edge-solder conductivity in reducing contact resistance. Cross-sectional microscopy corroborated the link between solder distribution and electrical performance, showing that edge solder voids are the primary resistance driver. This combined methodology provides a practical framework for quality control and design optimization of high-current HTS cables in fusion magnet applications."

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity strategies are typically built on risk-based frameworks that prioritize threats according to their perceived likelihood, impact, and the cost of mitigation. Although effective against frequent and high probability risks, this approach systematically underestimates rare but high-impact events. Such events, though statistically unlikely, can produce catastrophic disruption, as illustrated by the 9/11 attacks or the COVID-19 pandemic. Preventing these events would have required sustained investments that seemed economically or socially unjustifiable until after the disaster struck. This tension between efficiency and resilience exposes a systemic weakness: defenders often prioritize short-term risks over resilience for rare adversarial scenarios. This paper argues that it is feasible and necessary to develop novel countermeasures that address rare and high-impact risks without imposing prohibitive costs. Using autonomous drone-based border monitoring as a case study, we examine how attackers can exploit the system by injecting fake events. We propose mitigation strategies that introduce modest inefficiencies, such as random perturbations or suboptimal path choices, which substantially reduce susceptibility to manipulation while adding minimal overhead. We argue for a paradigm shift: from optimizing information systems exclusively for efficiency to designing resilient systems that can withstand rare but high-impact events."

While super-resolution is an efficient post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details. Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific simulations"

We present BDIViz, anovel visualanalytics system designed to stream line the schema matching process for biomedical data. Through formative studies with domain experts, we identified key requirements for an effective solution and developed interactive visualization techniques that address both scalability challenges and semantic am biguity. BDIViz employs an ensemble approach that combines multiple matching methods with LLM-based validation, summarizes matches through interactive heatmaps, and provides coordinated views that enable users to quickly compare attributes and their values.

    "abstract": "Change detection is essential in Earth observation, yet current models heavily rely on large-scale annotated datasets. Generative models offer a promising alternative by synthesizing training data, but generating temporally coherent image pairs with realistic, semantically meaningful changes remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches typically simulate changes by generating pre- and post-change label maps using either heuristic rules (e.g., copy-pasting) or text prompts. However, the former offers limited change diversity, while the latter often fails to maintain spatial consistency between image pairs. We observe that the noise space of diffusion models encodes strong generative capacity and spatial controllability: localized perturbations in the noise can yield meaningful, interpretable changes in corresponding image regions. Motivated by this, we propose <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Noise2Change</b>, a framework for simulating change directly in the noise domain. The key idea is to manipulate the semantic composition of the initial noise sampled from the noise domain, such that the diffusion process generates structurally consistent pre- and post-change images reflecting realistic transformations. Since the unperturbed noise is shared between both images, the resulting pairs exhibit strong temporal alignment and semantic coherence, effectively addressing the trade-off between realism and consistency. Concretely, we employ a discrete diffusion model to extract high-level semantics from the initial noise. Guided by these semantics, we introduce a change simulation strategy that optimizes the noise to encode intended changes. The modified noise is then used to drive the diffusion process, yielding pre- and post-change label maps with natural structural transitions. These maps are passed through a unified framework for image generation and label refinement, producing highly aligned image-label pairs. Our framework supports diverse change types across a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple change detection tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing generative approaches.

Ensuring the ability of impurity deposition and bubble separation while minimizing the size of the tank is a critical factor in the design of tank miniaturization. This paper focuses on studying the influence of tank miniaturization on its degassing and impurity removal functions. Firstly, the miniaturization model of the tank is established, and the accuracy of the simulation model for the miniaturized hydraulic fluid tank is verified by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) test. Then, the numerical simulation method is used to analyze the influence of tank miniaturization and fluid residence time on the functions of bubble separation and impurity sedimentation. Finally, it is concluded that the change in the degassing and impurity removal function of a miniaturized tank is primarily related to the fluid residence time and the flow state of the flow field, which provides theoretical guidance and technical support for the design of miniaturized hydraulic tank."

    "abstract": "Robots are often required to localize in environments with unknown object classes and semantic ambiguity. However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to large-vocabulary object categories in both real-world indoor scenes and synthetic environments."

The device is composed of a PVA-based conductive hydrogel layer with conical microstructures and screen-printed laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes produced by direct laser writing on polyimide (PI). Precise microstructure replication is enabled by this low-cost, scalable method without the need for cleanroom lithography. A sensitivity of 0.2413 kPa⁻¹ over 0–3 kPa is achieved by the sensor, along with a wide detection range of 0–66 kPa, rapid response/recovery times of 0.1s, low hysteresis of 1.16%, and stable operation over more than 2000 cycles. Physiological signals such as pulse, subtle motions, and large joint movements (knee, elbow) are reliably captured. Multipoint recognition is demonstrated through a 3×3 pressure-sensing array. These results highlight the potential of LIG pressure sensors incorporating flash-foam-fabricated PVA-based conical microstructures for applications in wearable health monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and soft robotics."

By utilizing this signal feature, GIS-ACE-Net replaces the GIs with low-amplitude symbols and performs the active constellation extension on the data symbols simultaneously with the PAPR being the loss function. Simulation results demonstrate that GIS-ACE-Net achieves significant PAPR reduction with a slight impact on the bit error rate performance under pilot-embedded channel estimation."

In this paper, we endeavor to employ identifier-free point annotation to achieve the competitive performance while minimizing annotation costs. Specifically, each instance across video frames are labeled by single points, without providing its instance identifier. Building upon this setting, we introduce an oriented vehicle joint detection and tracking framework for satellite video, focusing on enhancing model performance by carefully-designed sample acquisition and robust learning processes. Firstly, we leverage temporal and visual information to generate sequence-aligned pseudo-labels and visually-aligned synthetic objects, which complement each other during training by providing both exact appearance and annotation information. Secondly, a novel spatio-temporal consistency metric is developed to assess sample quality, which is then incorporated into a curriculum learning schedule. This strategy facilitates a gradual learning progression from high-quality data to low-quality or noisy examples, thereyby minimizing interference from potentially misleading samples. Finally, an end-to-end oriented object joint detection and tracking network is constructed to enable effective oriented vehicle dynamic analysis. Extensive ablation and experimental results on two satellite video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method."

    "abstract": "The integration of Energy Harvesting (EH) technology into Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) presents a promising solution to the energy limitations faced by end devices (EDs) when performing computation-intensive tasks, ultimately enhancing the EDs’ sustainability. However, the intermittent and unpredictable nature of harvested energy introduces significant uncertainty in energy availability, complicating dynamic task execution and resource management. In EH-MEC systems, managing task scheduling and offloading dynamically is crucial for optimizing application latency while ensuring long-term battery energy stability and task reliability. Existing approaches inadequately address the time-coupling between task decisions caused by long-term battery energy stability constraints, and often neglect task reliability considerations. To overcome these limitations, we propose decomposing the original problem into 1) a decoupling problem that transforms the optimization with long-term battery energy constraints into a series of deterministic optimizations within individual time slots, 2) a task scheduling problem that determines task-to-ES assignment and computing resource allocation of ESs to offloaded tasks, and 3) a task offloading problem that determines the optimal offloading decision to achieve minimal latency while meeting energy stability and server reliability constraints. To tackle these subproblems, we design a Lyapunov-based optimization method, a reliabilityaware task scheduling algorithm, and an efficient heuristic-based task offloading algorithm. Extensive simulations and experiments based on empirical data from a physical MEC testbed validate the efficacy of our approach."

Specifically, it examines the autonomic nervous system through heart rate variability using pulse rate variability (PRV) metrics derived from SCPPG. The study involved 79 participants, including patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i> = 22), as well as a control group (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i> = 57).

    "abstract": "The growing demand for deploying deep learning (DL) models, particularly large language models (LLMs), has made it imperative to optimize GPU energy consumption while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs). Significant energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from GPU-based inference tasks contribute substantially to the environmental footprint of the DL deployment. Existing approaches primarily rely on batching and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to optimize service performance or throughput, but often overlook memory frequency adjustments and holistic energy optimization under dynamic workloads. This study presents GREENDLS, a DL serving system that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with offline prediction models to optimize energy consumption while adhering to inference latency SLOs, achieving significant energy savings. GREENDLS dynamically adjusts batch size, GPU streaming multiprocessor (SM) frequency, and GPU memory frequency based on inference request rates. It also accounts for GPU energy consumption during idle phases, such as batch filling, enabling multi-parameter and fine-grained energy optimization. Compared to the Clipper system, GREENDLS achieves energy savings of up to 45.57% on the RTX 3080Ti and 39.44% on the Tesla V100S. When compared to the EAIS system, which only combines batching with GPU SM frequency adjustment, GREENDLS achieves energy savings of up to 36.44% on the RTX 3080Ti and 15.44% on the Tesla V100S. Against the method proposed by Yu et al., GREENDLS attains energy savings of up to 46.34% on the RTX 3080Ti and 33.74% on the Tesla V100S. In LLM inference tasks using Qwen, GREENDLS reduces average energy consumption by 40.79% compared to Clipper, 10.42% compared to EAIS, and 42.42% compared to Yu et al. These results clearly demonstrate that GREENDLS more effectively optimizes energy consumption compared to traditional methods that rely primarily on batching or a combination of batching and DVFS, while still ensuring SLO compliance."

    "abstract": "Efficiently managing route invalidation is important in Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs), mainly when downward traffic, from root to actuator nodes, commonly occurs. The No-Path Destination Advertisement Object (NPDAO) mechanism for route invalidation was initially proposed in RFC 6550. This approach can sometimes be inefficient, leading to stale routes, high overhead, and lower packet delivery ratios. A newer method, introduced in 2021 by RFC 9009, uses the mechanism through Destination Cleanup Object (DCO) messages for route invalidation. This paper implements DCO in Contiki-NG and compares its performance to NPDAO using the Cooja simulator. In the evaluated scenarios, the root and nodes within the tree send packets downwards to nodes that switch parent. The two route invalidation mechanisms are compared in scenarios with and without probing of the parents. The results show that in the most favourable scenario, the mechanism in RFC 9009 improves packet delivery ratio (PDR) for downward traffic from 66% (NPDAO) to 97% (DCO). Moreover, probing significantly improves network recovery times, which contributes to reliability. These findings validate and extend RFC 9009’s claims, confirming DCO’s suitability for WSANs."

Specifically, it incorporates entropy minimization and mutual information maximization to stabilize pseudo-label learning and avoid model collapse. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, CWRU and TPF, demonstrate that EPCSF consistently outperforms existing source-free methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalization. These results validate the effectiveness of EPCSF in realizing reliable knowledge transfer and high -confidence cross-domain fault classification without using any source domain data. Compared with existing SFDA methods, EPCSF introduces a novel integration of global memory-based contrastive learning and dual-mode confidence optimization, which enables more reliable pseudo-labeling and feature discrimination without access to any source data."

We propose a novel adaptive control strategy for WSNs that optimizes data transmission and EH to minimize overall energy consumption while ensuring queue stability and energy storing constraints under dynamic environmental conditions. The notion of adaptability therein is achieved by transferring the known environment-specific knowledge to new conditions resorting to the lifelong reinforcement learning (L2RL) concepts. We evaluate our proposed method against two baseline frameworks: Lyapunov-based optimization, and policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL). Simulation results demonstrate that our approach rapidly adapts to changing environmental conditions by leveraging transferable knowledge, achieving near-optimal performance approximately 30% faster than the RL method and 60% faster than the Lyapunov-based approach."

Nevertheless, some existing diffusion model-based methods often rely on effective noise estimation networks and ignore the modeling of the time dimension. This paper introduces a periodic dynamic prior probability diffusion model based on attention mechanism, Attention Prior-Guided De-noising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (APDM), which combines the attention mechanism and conditional diffusion generation process into a unified framework to achieve accurate distribution prediction of multivariate time series. More specifically, APDM projects historical time series and external covariate temporal features as conditional information, which will be integrated into the residual network of the noise estimator to extract the potential correlation with the estimated noise. Moreover, we design a simple and general attention strategy to extract local similarity patterns to improve the forecasting performance, and conduct extensive experiments on six datasets to verify the effectiveness of the model."

In this study, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that outputs both the likelihood and spatial coordinates of anomalous objects in video sequences. Conventional methods often suffer from limited spatial precision and detection confidence, particularly when trained on general datasets not tailored for anomaly-specific contexts. To address this issue, our approach incorporates an autoencoder during the preprocessing phase to estimate reconstruction errors in optical flow. These errors are then utilized as an auxiliary input to improve the sensitivity of the detection model. Furthermore, we employ Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to improve the localization of anomalous regions by highlighting the areas that most influence the model’s predictions."

This complexity is further exacerbated when taking into account the limited processing capabilities of APs and UEs. To solve this problem, we propose a mobility management scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our DRL agent dynamically adjusts the cluster of APs for each UE based on network dynamics, taking into account the limited radio resources and heterogeneous QoS requirements. Simulation results show that our proposed solution provides a satisfactory QoS per UE while significantly reducing fronthaul signaling."

While FTN inherently introduces inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to symbol packing, SVD-FTNS eliminates ISI through precoding and power allocation. However, inter-block interference (IBI) arises in block-based transmission, degrading capacity, which has been largely overlooked in prior studies. This paper evaluates the impact of IBI on SVD-FTNS and proposes a system design to mitigate it. A guard interval (GI) is introduced to suppress IBI, and its effect on capacity is analyzed. Results indicate that the conventional WOGI (without guard interval) approach, which neglects IBI, significantly overestimates capacity, causing overestimation of capacity. In contrast, the proposed WGI (with guard interval) approach properly accounts for IBI, ensuring a more accurate capacity evaluation. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that an optimal symbol packing ratio exists in WGI, leading to an appropriate design of the SVD-FTNS system."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the detection of spectrally-efficient modulation on conjugate reciprocal zeros (SE-MOCZ) as a promising non-coherent modulation for short packet communications (SPCs). SE-MOCZ combines the recently proposed MOCZ and faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling, by accelerating the pulses carrying the polynomial coefficients of MOCZ beyond the Nyquist limit, which introduces inter-polynomial-coefficient-interference (IPCI) and increases the number of the received complex zeros in the z-domain. We propose to use zero forcing (ZF) to assist the root-finding-minimum-distance (RFMD) detector of SE-MOCZ without the need to optimize the radius or to use the partial-complex-zeros-removal filter. In particular, given that the complex zeros due to the IPCI are fully known at the receiver, ZF can cancel such complex zeros, and hence, assist the RFMD detection. Simulation results show that the proposed ZF-RFMD detector outperforms the RFMD detector that adopts optimal radius and partial-complex-zeros-removal filter (up to 4 dB saving in E<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</inf>/N<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf> at the same error rate).

However, the performance of the OTFS modulation is degraded by hardware impairments (HIs), particularly at high frequencies and mobility. Thus, efficient signal detection is essential for reliable OTFS-based communication. To overcome this, various detectors, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), minimum mean square error (MMSE), and message passing (MP), have been explored in the literature, with CNN-based detectors demonstrating superior performance over MMSE and MP. In this work, we propose a residual channel attention network (RCAN) to robustly detect OTFS signal in the presence of HIs. Using deep residual learning and channel attention mechanisms to improve detection accuracy under varying channel conditions. Extensive simulations, considering different OTFS frame sizes, user mobility levels, and HI parameters, confirm that the proposed RCAN consistently outperforms conventional detectors, including CNN, in all scenarios evaluated. This makes RCAN a highly effective solution for OTFS-based high-mobility wireless communication systems, both with and without HI."

As the use of UAVs becomes more prevalent in various tasks, the demand for cross-domain task allocation and operations continues to grow. Cross-domain task allocation enables the UAVs to flexibly execute tasks over a wider range, work together in different task domains, thereby improving operation efficiency. However, due to variations in management policies, authentication protocols, and security standards across various domains, to ensure the secure and reliable interoperability of UAVs across diverse domains, cross-domain authentication has become the primary line of defense for UAVs.

To achieve a lightweight authentication process, we apply certificateless authentication and avoid costly operations for resource-constrained UAVs. Additionally, the trustworthiness of UAVs and domains is evaluated through credibility, which is stored on blockchain.

    "abstract": "In future wireless communication, an exponential increase in connected devices and the need for safety-critical and data-intensive applications like Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and eXtended Reality (XR) will render large-scale intelligent agent deployments infeasible. To address this, we propose a novel framework where a centralized Smart Service Provider (SSP) transmits actions to agents, balancing effectiveness and transmission costs. Our approach leverages the observation that both semantic information extraction from raw sensor data and action generation from semantic states are many-to-one mappings. We model action decisions using stochastic policies from Reinforcement Learning (RL) literature. A key novelty is our focus on when to transmit. Namely, the SSP, observing what an agent observes, estimates the agent’s likely action. Based on the weighted statistical distance between the SSP’s policy and the agent’s estimated policy, the SSP decides whether an \"action innovation\" has occurred, and if so, transmits an action to the agent. Simulations demonstrate that transmitting only 10% of the time is sufficient to satisfy goals with up to 1% deviation, and compression rates up to 8,108:1 are achievable compared to existing standards. This \"effective communication\" scheme significantly reduces transmission overhead while maintaining high performance."

Further, mechanical vibration stimuli applied to the upper body can amplify emotions during activities like video viewing or gameplay. This study aimed to promote empathy by delivering vibration stimuli triggered by a partner’s physiological arousal. Eleven participants formed pairs and played a cooperative game with different roles. Skin conductance responses (SCR) were measured, and vibration stimuli were presented when a partner’s SCR increased. Participants reported greater empathy when vibration stimuli were delivered compared to when they were not. These findings suggest a method for enhancing emotional connection between individuals in interactive settings."

    "abstract": "The combination of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can improve the resource utilization in non-line-of-sight scenarios. However, the private information in this situation raises security concerns when the transmission behavior is detected by wardens. Against this background, we investigate a covert transmission problem in an RIS assisted ISAC system. Specifically, we obtain a tractable form of covertness constraint in terms of minimum detection error probability via the optimal detection threshold, paving the way for optimization process. Then, the sum covert transmission rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the beamforming of confidential signal and jamming signal as well as the RIS’s phase shift. To solve the above non-convex problem, we propose a joint covert beamforming and the phase shift of RIS optimization-based twins-deep deterministic policy gradient (CBP-TD3) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CBP-TD3 algorithm in the covertness."

    "abstract": "Brain age estimation from structural MRI is an effective approach for detecting abnormal neurodevel opment and neurodegeneration. However, most existing methods produce global biomarkers that lack tissue-level specificity and fail to leverage medical prior knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose T2AgeNet, a dual-path image–text framework for tissue-level brain age estimation that integrates anatomical features with clinical semantics. The framework first segments brain MRI to generate tissue-specific masks, forming the basis for localized age prediction. To further incorporate medical prior knowledge, the model first aligns visual features with personalized clinical descriptions to guide semantic understanding of tissue-level variation. In parallel, it transforms handcrafted aging-related features into textual representations through an auxiliary branch using a large language model, enabling enriched interpretation and representation. We evaluate T2AgeNet on five datasets spanning fetal development, preterm infants, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Results demonstrate accurate age estimation across diverse populations. On the OASIS-3 and ABIDE-I datasets, the model further identifies tissue specific structural abnormalities consistent with known neurological patterns."

Existing pose-estimation models exhibit markedly degraded accuracy upon transfer to tiny-target metrology tasks such as inspection of industrial-parts. This paper introduces Micro-Pose, a two-stage RTMPose-m variant that replaces the CSPNext backbone with UIB search blocks. This redesign markedly boosts tiny-target detection accuracy while drastically compressing parameter count, achieving a superior accuracy-speed trade-off. Plugged into an industrial inspection framework, Micro-Pose enables end-to-end workpiece positioning and metrology in real time. Furthermore, we introduce an error-evaluation algorithm tailored to multi-target scenes, which employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to resolve spatial-constraint problems. To validate our model, we released a dataset comprising 7420 hex-bolt images annotated with keypoint labels. In the COCO AP metric, our method reduces the parameter count by 37% and outperforms the original RTMPose-s and RTMPose-m by 0.7% and 2.0%, respectively, while maintaining the same inference speed as RTMPose-s. Under multi-target conditions, the dimensional accuracy reaches 1mm."

However, most video content providers encrypt or embed subtitles in ways that prevent direct text extraction, necessitating the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for detection and recognition. Current state-of-the-art video text spotting methods are not optimized for real-time operation on edge devices. To address this challenge, this study introduces the specialized neural network architectures designed for on-device video content classification, subtitle tracking, detection and recognition. To enhance efficiency, the proposed neural network architectures employ advanced optimization techniques, including pruning and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), significantly reducing memory and computational demands while maintaining high real-time performance on TV devices. Through rigorous testing and on-device end-to-end (E2E) evaluation, we achieved an impressive novel state-of-the-art E2E word recognition accuracy of over 97% across seven languages, with a low latency of under 150 ms per screen. The findings hold great potential for extending this technology to other platforms, including IoT devices and digital appliances."

    "abstract": "Industrial robots are widely employed in machinery manufacturing due to multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) and flexibility. However, backlash not only degrades the bidirectional repeatability and multi-directional repeatability of the end-effector, but also complicates its identification and compensation compared with geometric errors. Existing backlash identification and compensation methods ignore the principle of backlash error transmission, which severely limits the improvement of both bidirectional repeatability and multi-directional repeatability of the robot end-effector. In contrast to existing studies, this article presents the first systematic discussion correlating backlash with bidirectional repeatability and multi-directional repeatability, and proposes a pipeline including modeling, identification and compensation methods. Based on the principle of backlash error transmission, a mathematical model incorporating the reduction ratio correction coefficient, backlash and joint rotation direction is developed and integrated into a robotic kinematic error model with higher-order joint-dependent error terms. Since the pose deviation between adjacent coordinate systems is a linear function incorporating backlash and kinematic errors, a Taylor expansion is performed on this function with higher-order error terms neglected, and the iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm is employed to identify backlash and kinematic parameter errors. A compensation method that accounts for both backlash and compensation direction is also proposed, where the compensation direction is determined by the joint velocity before the joint arrives at the target point. Experiments were conducted to compare the single-axis rotation identification and compensation approach implemented on a 6-DoF robot with the innovative method proposed in this article. The experimental results indicate that the traditional single-axis method requires repeated single-axis movements for each joint, resulting in low efficiency in backlash identification and compensation, and it fails to consider the impact of backlash on multi-directional repeatability. In contrast, the proposed method rapidly identifies backlash in each joint and improves bidirectional repeatability and multi-directional repeatability by 47.97% and 53.44%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods typically rely on imitation learning (IL) but face a key challenge: the misalignment between open-loop training and closed-loop deployment. This misalignment often triggers driver-initiated takeovers and system disengagements during closed-loop execution. How to leverage those expert takeover data from disengagement scenarios and effectively expand the IL policy's capability presents a valuable yet unexplored challenge. In this paper, we propose TakeAD, a novel preference-based post-optimization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained IL policy with this disengagement data to enhance the closed-loop driving performance. First, we design an efficient expert takeover data collection pipeline inspired by human takeover mechanisms in real-world autonomous driving systems. Then, this post-optimization framework integrates iterative Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for imitation learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for preference alignment. The DAgger stage equips the policy with fundamental capabilities to handle disengagement states through direct imitation of expert interventions. Subsequently, the DPO stage refines the policy's behavior to better align with expert preferences in disengagement scenarios. Through multiple iterations, the policy progressively learns recovery strategies for disengagement states, thereby mitigating the open-loop gap. Experiments on the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate our method's effectiveness compared with pure IL methods, with comprehensive ablations confirming the contribution of each component."

    "abstract": "In conventional Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), model knowledge is transferred to the target domain with access to annotated source data, which is an unsuitable strategy for cross-domain scenarios involving data privacy and confidentiality. In this paper, we focus on source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) for semantic segmentation tasks, which adapts source-trained models to unannotated target domains without relying on source data. Self-training paradigms dominate the existing approaches, but often suffer from significant performance degradation due to unreliable pseudolabels and knowledge forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose innovative self-supervised spatial–temporal consistency learning for source-free domain adaptive segmentation (S<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>T-SFDA). Specifically, to address pseudolabel ambiguity in various spatial contexts, a spatial multiview consistency (SMVC) mechanism is proposed to constrain the semantic consistency across different spatial views of the same image. To mitigate the knowledge forgetting problem caused by a lack of supervisory information, a temporal dynamic consistency (TDC) mechanism, which harnesses historical knowledge consistency to regularize the current model evolution direction, is proposed. Furthermore, to improve the category-discriminative representation capabilities under domain shifts, a spatial-temporal contrastive (STC) strategy is designed to promote the intrinsic semantic association of features belonging to different categories in the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted on two domain-adaptive remote sensing (RS) segmentation benchmarks. The results demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed method when integrated into various advanced segmentation architectures, as well as its excellent generalization performance across different cross-domain RS scenarios."

The proposed method employs an advanced two-stage approach based on the Wiener process with drift to model degradation. The model parameters are iteratively estimated and updated using the least-squares method to accurately capture the degradation trajectory. Experimental validation on the Pronostia bearing dataset demonstrates that the proposed method achieves the lowest MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values under different operating conditions, confirming its superior prediction accuracy and reliability compared with traditional statistical and model-based methods."

The system incorporates an electronically isolated transmitter and bucking coil and utilizes an electronically controlled cancelation approach to suppress the primary magnetic field at the receiver coil. This integrated hardware-software control architecture enables the system to effectively bridge the frequency gap between traditional EMI sensors (operating from a few hertz to several tens of kilohertz and primarily sensitive to eddy currents in the soil) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) systems (operating from a few to several hundred megahertz and are sensitive to displacement currents). The instrument is designed for easy deployment from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for collecting high-resolution data over the Earth’s surface in both horizontal and vertical directions. Operating within the intermediate frequency range of approximately 100 kHz to several megahertz, this newly developed UAS-deployable frequency-domain electromagnetic induction (FDEMI) sensor enables rapid, cost-effective, and high-resolution spatial and spectral non-invasive measurements, resulting detailed mapping of subsurface electromagnetic properties, including electrical conductivity, magnetic susceptibility and dielectric permittivity. The data presented in this study were collected over a freshwater lake in Lyme, NH, and in the discontinuous permafrost zone of Fox, AK, at 93 kHz and 330 kHz. Results from both locations demonstrate this new FDEMI sensor’s sensitivity to (i) low-conductivity soils and (ii) variations in depth to permafrost."

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in developing digital representations of physical systems is capturing their dynamic and nonlinear characteristics under varying operating conditions. This research work introduces an adaptive digital twin (DT) framework for condition monitoring of permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) used in wind turbine drivetrain applications. The proposed framework employs particle swarm optimization (PSO) to update the physics-informed model and enhance real-time state estimation. Unlike static models, which do not account for parameter changes, the proposed PSO-based DT model (PDTM) adapts to parameter variations, tracks power loss fluctuations, and interprets degradation as a fault indicator. This work introduces an innovative integration of a physics-informed DT with real-time parameter adaptation, providing accurate state estimation and abnormality detection capabilities not available with conventional datasheet models or purely data-driven approaches. The framework's effectiveness for fault diagnostics is further demonstrated through a digital-twin-assisted multi-layer diagnostic architecture. The proposed methodology is validated using a 1kW PMSM-based experimental setup that considers transient conditions, load changes, and fault scenarios. Results show that the PDTM outperforms traditional models by accurately tracking PMSM states, estimating power losses, and adapting in real-time to various fault scenarios."

    "abstract": "Two-sided matching is a foundational topic that traditionally assumes participants have perfect knowledge of their pReferences. However, in practice, many participants lack precise information about potential matches. The competing bandits model, based on the multi-armed bandit framework, addresses this uncertainty by enabling participants to learn through interactions. While most existing research has focused on one-to-one matching, real-world scenarios—such as resource allocation in wireless networks—often involve cases in which a single resource can accommodate multiple participants, making it essential to adapt the framework to better reflect practical applications. In this paper, we extend the analysis to many-to-one matching. To enhance practical relevance and reduce restrictive assumptions, we introduce four key properties: full decentralization, accommodation of arbitrary and private preferences, absence of winner observation, and regret minimization with respect to the optimal stable matching. These properties introduce challenges such as severe information scarcity and complex preference structures. To address the issue of limited information, we propose techniques such as random pulls and specialized communication protocols to facilitate information gathering by agents. We further conduct a detailed analysis of complex preference structures and identify a critical property that underpins the development of our algorithm, SUBMARINE. Our proposed algorithm achieves logarithmic regret, representing a notable advancement: it is the first to satisfy all the outlined properties while attaining the lowest known regret bound."

    "abstract": "Pitch bending in the accordion is achieved by lightly pressing a key, thereby narrowing the opening of the reed box valve. It is hypothesized that the resonance of the reed box plays an important role in this phenomenon. To investigate this, a physical model of the accordion has been developed that incorporates the acoustic resonance of the reed box. Time-domain simulations based on this model successfully reproduce pitch bending when the valve opening is narrowed."

Clustered delay line models from 3GPP are considered with a subset of blocked propagation components. Assuming the receiver cannot update its equalizer during blockage events, a statistical analysis of the erroneously equalized channel gains is performed to provide the probability density functions of the received symbols depending on the blockage. BER derivations are then obtained and validated through simulations. The provided expressions allow predicting the performance of DAS and accurately analyze the impact of various blockage scenarios."

    "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), achieving high model accuracy often comes at the cost of increased energy consumption, particularly when incorporating robust privacy-preserving techniques like homomorphic encryption (HE). While HE enhances security by enabling encrypted aggregation of local models—thus mitigating data leakage and inference attacks without requiring a trusted aggregator—it also introduces computational overhead that impacts energy efficiency.This paper presents a novel approach for Adaptive Encryption Federated Learning (AEFL). AEFL strategically tunes encryption complexity to achieve the best trade-off between model accuracy and energy efficiency without compromising security. When additional energy from harvested sources is available, AEFL enhances model accuracy by adjusting encryption parameters to support more intensive computations. During periods of limited energy, the system focuses on conserving resources while maintaining robust encryption to ensure data security. This adaptive approach maximizes energy efficiency without lowering the security threshold, allowing for improved model performance when energy conditions permit.Experimental results show that AEFL improves energy efficiency by over 35% and increases the pool of eligible clients for FL by approximately 18%, all while maintaining a security level above 128 bits. Importantly, these gains are achieved with minimal impact on model accuracy, demonstrating that significant energy savings are possible in FL environments without sacrificing data security or model performance."

    "abstract": "Utilizing cutting-edge technologies, precision agriculture maximizes agricultural productivity while reducing environmental effects. By tackling the issues of rising food demand and environmental preservation, precision agriculture has emerged as a revolutionary method of sustainable farming. A crucial component of agriculture, fertilizer application frequently suffers from inefficiencies brought on by traditional uniform distribution techniques that disregard temporal and spatial variability in soil conditions. Overuse of nutrients, environmental damage, and financial losses for farmers are the outcomes of these inefficiencies. A promising answer to these problems is provided by the development of deep learning algorithms in conjunction with real-time soil sensor data. This study investigates how to optimize fertilizer application by combining real-time soil sensor data with deep learning algorithms. Real-time, detailed information on soil characteristics, such as pH, moisture content, and nutrient content, is provided via soil sensors. Our goal is to develop an accurate and scalable system that minimizes fertilizer waste, enhances plant health, and lessens environmental harm by integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with temporal data processing from soil sensors. Recent developments in machine learning for precision agriculture, with an emphasis on soil nutrient prediction and application optimization, are highlighted in an extensive literature analysis. Decision tree methods are used by a recommendation engine to produce useful information for fertilizer distribution. Real-world experiments and datasets are used to further evaluate this system, guaranteeing its scalability and resilience. Real-world experiments and implementation using publicly accessible datasets show notable increases in crop productivity and fertilizer efficiency. The findings highlight how deep learning can revolutionize the adoption of sustainable farming methods. The results demonstrate how well the suggested strategy works to increase agricultural sustainability and resource efficiency. Prediction reliability and adaptability have significantly improved, according to accuracy measurements and comparisons with current techniques."

In-game dialogues often contain informal expressions, character-specific tones, and emotional nuances that are critical for preserving narrative immersion. As a baseline, we use ChatGPT, which generally produces fluent and contextually appropriate translations. We qualitatively evaluate BERT’s translations against this baseline, focusing on style fidelity, speaker consistency, and conversational naturalness. While BERT provides structurally accurate and literal translations, it tends to lack contextual sensitivity and character-aware adaptation. These findings highlight the limitations of applying unadapted BERT models in narrative contexts. Based on the results, we propose future enhancements through character-specific fine-tuning and context-aware modeling. This study serves as a first step toward building an adaptive, character-sensitive translation system for dialogue-intensive game environments."

Neural network-based approaches have shown superior noise reduction performance compared to the conventional filtered-x least mean squares algorithm in simulation environments. However, we observed that it generates excessive mid- and high-frequency components, which increase residual error. To address this, we propose a low-frequency focused learning, which applies a low-pass filter (LPF) during training and canceling to improve lower frequency reduction. We evaluate the proposed method using data that simulates the real environment of active noise canceling in headphones and includes the effects of the primary path obtained through measurement. Evaluated results showed the proposed method achieved improvements of 3.12 dB (41.4%) average noise reduction and a maximum of 6.03 dB over the previous method without LPF."

A single patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis participated in the study, and NIRS signals were measured during two tasks, mental arithmetic and music imagery, with 24 trials each. Time-domain features and spectral-domain features were extracted from the NIRS signals. A model was constructed by integrating weak learners created for each channel using majority voting, with cognitive tasks as teacher labels, and the classification accuracy was calculated using 24-fold cross-validation. The model correctly classified 39 out of 48 trials, achieving an average accuracy of 81%. This method demonstrates the potential for applying the technique to BCI to enable communication for patients with neurological disorders using residual brain function."

Recent studies highlight the existence of several foundational models capable to process and interpret Electronic Health Records (EHR), underscoring their potential in developing Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). This paper presents a comparative analysis of nine open-source LLMs organised over three macro categories: (a) general-purpose (3), (b) trained using medical-domain data only (1), and (c) general-purpose fine-tuned on medical-domains dataset (5). The models have been evaluated across four different Questions Answering (QA) medical datasets: two generic, iCliniq and LiveQA, and two specific for chronic disease, diabetes-QA-dataset-origin for diabetes, and Cardio-docs-qa for cardiology. The evaluation involves three different tokenizers (GPT2TokenizerFast, LlamaTokenizerFast and PreTrainedTokenizerFast) and three different fine-tuning strategies. Moreover, fine-tuning is performed using three specific datasets. Performance metrics are derived using the BERTScore. The achieved results show that all models have similar performance over all testing datasets, with the best performance achieved by a recent general-purpose model (DeepSeek): Fine-tuning activities slightly increase performance over all datasets for one model only. Additionally, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA (QLORA) are confirmed as the most effective fine-tuning techniques."

A wireless system that shares spectrum with signal/protocol awareness can allocate more spectrum for dynamic channel access. This paper introduces a Transformer-Based algorithm developed specifically for Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) radio protocol recognition, leveraging low-cost SDR-based spectrum sensing capabilities. Unlike traditional approaches that require gigabytes of training data, our method achieves satisfactory results using only 100k (approximately 100–400megabytes of data) samples in total. The paper makes three key contributions: First, the model is trained on only 33k samples per protocol using a customized Transformer tailored for protocol classification. Second, over-the-air test datasets demonstrated near-perfect detection accuracy (exceeding 99%) at 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and above, enabling SDR-based spectrum sensing. Third, experiments conducted with real WLAN traffic generated using development boards achieved detection accuracy of at least 96%. We compared our Transformer-Based model with CNN and MLP classifiers and found that it consistently outperformed them in protocol recognition, even with minimal training data. Our findings suggest that intelligent spectrum sensing is achievable using low-cost devices, and that algorithms trained on compact datasets can attain state-of-the-art detection accuracy."

Accurate path loss predictions can optimize use of the radio frequency spectrum and minimize unwanted interference. Modern path loss modeling often leverages data-driven approaches, using machine learning to train models on drive test measurement datasets. Drive tests primarily represent downlink scenarios, where the Tx is located on a building and the Rx is located on a moving vehicle. Consequently, trained models are frequently reserved for downlink coverage estimation, lacking representation of uplink scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate that data augmentation can be used to train a path loss model that is generalized to uplink, downlink, and backhaul scenarios, training using only downlink drive test measurements. By adding a small number of synthetic samples representing uplink scenarios to the training set, root mean squared error is reduced by > 8 dB on uplink examples in the test set."

The analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between near-miss frequency and accident occurrence, suggesting that near-misses may serve as a useful indicator of traffic risk. Furthermore, the rate of near-miss events including sudden braking and acceleration was notably higher in low-speed zones, indicating clear behavioral differences depending on speed conditions."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an improved anomaly detection algorithm for O-RAN Near-RT RIC environments by enhancing the Isolation Forest-based xApp deployed for traffic steering. Conventional implementations rely on arbitrary or correlation-based feature selection and (semi-)supervised-like hyperparameter tuning, which can result in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we introduce a proxy label generation method grounded domain expertise, enabling evaluation-driven hyperparameter optimization. We further propose a three-step feature selection framework to produce interpretable and effective feature subsets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently improves F1-score performance, with Bayesian optimization showing the most robust results. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the value of retaining certain correlated features that may be beneficial for tree-based models like Isolation Forest, counter to common practices in feature selection. These findings validate the proposed framework’s applicability in O-RAN anomaly detection and offer new directions for interpretable xApp development."

    "abstract": "Space Domain Awareness (SDA) system has different major aspects including continuous and robust awareness from the network that is crucial for efficient control over all actors in space. The observability of the space assets, on the other hand, requires efficient analysis of when and how observed space objects can be controlled. This becomes crucial when real-world spatial dynamics are taken into account, as it introduces complexities into the system. The real-world dynamics can reveal the structure of the network, including isolated and dominant stations. We propose a Temporal Spectrum Analysis (TSA) scheme that takes into account a set of real-world parameters, including actual dynamics of the objects in space, to analyze the structure of a ground-space network that inherits temporal spectrum as the key element of design. We study the potential interactions between multiple constellations using TSA and conduct comprehensive real-world simulations to quantify the structure of the network. Numerical results show how the temporal spectrum of each satellite affects the intra- and inter-constellation network structure, including interactions between ground stations and constellations."

While such HR can be applied in a VR since the real hand does not appear to the user, in augmented reality (AR), the user’s real hand is visible alongside the virtual hand, which might reduce the HR illusion using the VR technique. To this challenge, we conducted two exploratory experiments to evaluate whether VR-based HR techniques can be applied in AR without disrupting user performance or whether there are different elements to be used before the HR in AR. Results indicate minimal impact on behavior, supporting HR’s potential as lightweight pseudo-haptic feedback in AR. Our results provided the potential to apply HR in the AR environment."

    "abstract": "Mutual coupling is essentially the physical phenomenon where the voltage on one antenna induces excitation currents on its surrounding antennas. Mutual coupling usually occurs in holographic MIMO (HMIMO) systems, distorting the intended radiation pattern of the array. Nevertheless, the impacts of mutual coupling on wideband HMIMO have not yet been fully investigated in the literature. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper initially unveils the frequency-dependent nature of mutual coupling, which emanates from frequency-dependent antenna impedance and mutual impedance. Subsequently, this paper proposes an innovative frequency-dependent coupling-aware beamforming methodology to mitigate frequency-dependent mutual coupling (FDMC). Upon this approach, both FDMC and frequency-dependent channels (FDC) can be simultaneously mitigated for wideband HMIMO communications. Simulation results validate the necessity of mitigating FDMC and substantiate the efficacy of our proposed beamforming-based mitigation in enhancing the wideband performance of HMIMO."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, baby safety monitoring has become a growing trend in the research domain. Babies aged 12-24 months are highly active and undergo rapid developmental growth, which can sometimes lead to falls or other unsafe scenarios. As a result, various research initiatives and commercial products have been developed for the safety monitoring of babies using Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) models and neural networks. However, these models, particularly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, often encounter performance issues, primarily due to overfitting. Overfitting is a prevalent concern that can significantly challenge the model's efficacy, affect model generalization, prediction accuracy, and reliability. This paper has been tailored to address the causes for overfitting and explore techniques to reduce or prevent it by incorporating some techniques, improving the model performance. The Traditional Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN) model exhibited significant overfitting, with a loss of training and validation of 0.08 and 0.745, respectively. To address this, an improved CNN model, Benchmark CNN (BCNN-BGRDOS), is proposed based on Batch Normalization (B), Global (G) Average Pooling, Regularization (R), Dropout (DO), and Stochastic (S) Gradient Descent optimizer, is employed. The statistical analysis indicated the proposed BCNN-BGRDOS exhibited superior performance relative to TCNN, attaining high training (0.9947) and validation (0.9968) accuracies, alongside low training (0.0271) and validation (0.0193) losses. The improved CNN model, enhanced further with an attention mechanism, is used further in the baby safety monitoring system to predict falls."

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand decoding algorithms that simultaneously offer high reliability and low complexity under stringent latency constraints. While iterative decoding schemes for LDPC and Polar codes offer a good compromise between performance and complexity, they fall short in approaching the theoretical performance limits in the typical URLLC short block length regime. Conversely, quasi-ML decoding schemes for algebraic codes, like Chase-II decoding, exhibit a smaller gap to optimum decoding but are computationally prohibitive for practical deployment in URLLC systems. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced Chase-II decoding algorithm that leverages a neural network (NN) to predict promising perturbation patterns, drastically reducing the number of required decoding trials. The proposed approach combines the reliability of quasi-ML decoding with the efficiency of NN inference, making it well-suited for time-sensitive and resource-constrained applications."

In the experiment, four types of natural material textures—fabric, wallpaper, woven straw, and artificial grass—were virtually rendered and presented to participants. Ten participants compared three virtual stimulation conditions presented in random order: electrostatic friction only, vibrotactile only, and a combined stimulation. The results showed that the combined stimulation was consistently rated as more realistic than either single modality alone. This finding contributes to the development of surface texture displays with high realism."

To this end, accurate propagation models are essential for network adaptation, but developing real-time, high-fidelity models is a significant challenge. Machine Learning (ML)-based channel models have gained attention in recent years, yet their limited generalizability often necessitates extensive retraining to ensure applicability in unseen environments. In this paper, we propose a process chain for rapid network adaptation in dynamic environments. Our fully automated process encompasses network Key Performance Indicator collection, LiDAR-based environmental modeling, Transfer Learning (TL)-assisted refinement of the ML-based IndoorDRaGon propagation model, and network planning. We demonstrate that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) achieve comparable accuracy to Random Forest (RF)-based models while offering significantly faster adaptation to new environments. Unlike RFs, ANNs do not need to be retrained from scratch using all the source data, which reduces computational effort and improves data privacy as only the new data is required. This enables efficient and dynamic network reconfiguration in previously unseen scenarios with just a few new measurements."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Mamba and its variants excel at modeling long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity, making them effective for diverse vision tasks. However, Mamba’s reliance on unfolding 1D sequential representations necessitates multiple directional scans to recover lost spatial dependencies. This introduces significant computational overhead, redundant token traversal, and inefficiencies that compromise accuracy in real-world applications. To this end, we propose PH-Mamba, a novel framework integrating position encoding and harmonized attention for image deraining and beyond. PH-Mamba transforms Mamba’s scanning process into a position-guided, unidirectional scanning that selectively prioritizes degradation-relevant tokens. Specifically, we devise a position-guided hybrid Mamba module (PHMM) that jointly encodes perturbation features alongside their spatial coordinates and harmonized representation to model consistent degradation patterns. Within PHMM, a harmonized Transformer is developed to focus on uncertain regions while suppressing noise interference, thereby improving spatial modeling fidelity. Additionally, we employ a vector decomposition and synthesis strategy to enable the unified representation layout to global degradation by directional scanning while minimizing redundancy. By cascading multiple PHMM blocks, PH-Mamba combines global positional guidance with local differential features to strengthen contextual learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PH-Mamba across low-level image restoration benchmarks. For example, compared to NeRD, PH-Mamba achieves a 0.60 dB PSNR improvement while requiring 88.9% fewer parameters, 36.2% less computation, and 63.0% faster inference time."

    "abstract": "While differential privacy (DP) contributes to pre serving data privacy during federated learning (FL), DP-FL suffers from either premature convergence or underutilized privacy budgets and subsequently degraded accuracy. Some recent studies heuristically adjusted the variance of the DP noises but offered no guarantee of optimality, little insight, and limited scalability. This paper presents a new control framework for (ε, δ)-DP FL to address the prevalent issues of DP-FL, i.e., premature convergence or underutilized privacy budgets. The key idea is to interpret the DP perturbation of DP-FL as a control process, where the DP noise variance and communication rounds are interdependent and jointly and adaptively determined. An optimal control framework is proposed to adjust the communication rounds and DP noise variance, adapting to the training accuracy of DP-FL. The optimality gap of (ε, δ)-DP FL is derived under the optimal control framework. The importance of joint orchestration of the DP noise and communication rounds is delineated. Experiments on MLP, CNN, and ResNet-9 models show that, given a privacy level, our control framework allows DP-FL to converge much faster with better accuracy than existing techniques, including those with persistent or heuristically reconfigurable DP noise variances."

An asymmetric Fabry–Pérot cavity model explains the absorption mechanism. Full-wave FEM simulations show up to 100% mid-infrared absorption, tunable via graphene chemical potential, nanoribbon width, and spacer thickness. For refractive index sensing, the device exhibits a high sensitivity of ∼2500 nm/RIU and a figure of merit of ∼32/RIU. The results highlight the potential of graphene-based absorbers for mid-infrared photodetectors and highly sensitive refractive index sensing applications."

Existing approaches typically rely on navigation-based trajectory replanning, which assumes sufficient reaction time and leading to fails when obstacles approach rapidly. In such scenarios, quadrupedal robots require reflexive evasion capabilities to perform instantaneous, low-latency maneuvers. This paper introduces Reflexive Evasion Robot (REBot), a control framework that enables quadrupedal robots to achieve real-time reflexive obstacle avoidance. REBot integrates an avoidance policy and a recovery policy within a finite-state machine. With carefully designed learning curricula and by incorporating regularization and adaptive rewards, REBot achieves robust evasion and rapid stabilization in instantaneous DOA tasks. We validate REBot through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating notable improvements in avoidance success rates, energy efficiency, and robustness to fast-moving obstacles.

A good cooperative relationship is likely to prompt neighboring agents to draw close each other, while a competitive relationship can easily lead to neighboring agents moving away from each other. This paper aims to investigate how to implement formation containment for multi-agent networks with both cooperative and competitive interactions in two-dimensional space, where the followers are unaware of the topology information and the expected formation information, but the leaders are. The leaders form a connection matrix based on the expected formation information, and then utilize it to build interaction relationships with the group of followers. The followers design asynchronous distributed control protocols based on the interaction information of local neighbors and adjust their own states. By establishing topological and algebraic conditions for cooperative and competitive relationships, it is theoretically confirmed that followers can still gather into the convex hull formed by the leaders and form the expected formation, even if the network contains both cooperative and competitive relationships. At last, the theoretical results of this paper are validated through numerical simulations."

    "abstract": "Pupillometry has recently emerged as a sensitive biomarker for autonomic and cortical activity, offering a non-invasive readout for neuromodulation research. However, existing commercial and deep learning–based pupillometry systems are primarily designed for humans, rendering them unsuitable for rodent experiments due to differences in ocular morphology, fur-induced optical artifacts, and the computational demands of high-resolution imaging. In this study, we present a low-cost, integrated real-time rodent pupillometry system built on an embedded platform. The proposed rule-based pupillometry algorithm was optimized with adaptive ellipse fitting, RGB masking artifact suppression, and greedy tracking, achieving robust performance under infrared illumination without requiring GPU acceleration. By minimizing errors caused by complex fur patterns and rodent-specific ocular features, our approach achieved an 86.0% detection rate in rat pupillometry, substantially surpassing the 63.1% attained by existing approach. The system was validated in vivo through vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) experiments in Long-Evans rats, where dynamic changes in pupil size reliably reflected stimulation intensity. By enabling an effective evaluation of VNS, these findings highlight the utility of our system as a practical preclinical tool and underscore the broader potential of pupillometry as a non-invasive biomarker for neuromodulation."

In the proposed SRIS-NOMA scheme, with the assistance of the STAR-RIS, multiple passive users first harvest energy from a power station (PS) and then leverage the harvested energy for local computation and task offloading to the base station (BS). To maximize total computation bits (TCB) of the SRIS-NOMA scheme, we jointly design the time allocation, local computing frequency (LCF), users’ transmit power, BS’s receive beamforming (BRB), and the STAR-RIS coefficients. Specifically, the optimal time allocation solution is determined by one-dimensional search, while closed-form solutions for LCF, users’ transmit power, and the BRB vector are derived, and efficient solutions for the STAR-RIS coefficients are obtained using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SRIS-NOMA scheme surpasses the benchmarks in terms of TCB performance."

    "abstract": "Signalized intersections are among the most crash-prone elements of urban traffic networks. Their complex layouts and heterogeneous road users pose substantial challenges for accurate trajectory prediction. Although high-definition (HD) maps are widely used to boost prediction performance, their high construction and maintenance costs and limited update frequency hinder practical deployment. Meanwhile, existing map-free models still struggle to reach the accuracy required in such complex settings. To address these issues, we propose MFIG-Net (Map-Free Intersection Graph Network), a map-free, multi-agent trajectory prediction framework tailored to signalized intersections. MFIG-Net comprises three components. First, a Multi-Source Feature Encoder (MSFE) builds per-agent node embeddings by jointly encoding motion histories and static attributes together with traffic-signal phase semantics; the latter are represented using remaining-time sinusoidal positional encodings passed through an MLP to capture phase transitions. Second, the interaction layer combines a Conflict-Aware Graph Attention (CAGA) module—modeling dense spatial interactions via physically grounded, directed edge features and enhanced multi-head attention—with a Mamba-based temporal block that captures long-range dependencies through linear-time selective state-space dynamics. Third, a Laplace Mixture Density Network (MDN) decoder produces <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i> multimodal future trajectories per agent with per-timestep scale parameters and mode probabilities, yielding accurate and calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on the SinD dataset from two-phase signalized intersections in Tianjin and Xi’an validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Additional evaluations on the Argoverse dataset further demonstrate its applicability across diverse urban scenarios, where it outperforms most existing map-free approaches."

However, current data-driven CF models, particularly those based on reinforcement learning (RL), often face challenges in engineering reward functions and adequately addressing uncertainties in vehicle motion predictions. In response, this letter introduces a novel human-like CF policy learning approach that synergizes the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) framework with an enhanced Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, utilizing both human driving data and environmental interactions. We first develop a deep ensemble learning model for robust leading vehicle motion prediction with uncertainty quantification. Then, we employ GAIL to learn an implicit reward function, thereby avoiding the manual design of the reward function in DDPG. Moreover, we augment the state with predictive insights for proactive decision-making, and incorporate a dual critic strategy and behavior cloning loss to improve learning stability and mimic human-like driving. Extensive evaluations on multiple naturalistic driving datasets, complemented by thorough ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in achieving superior accuracy, safety, and comfort in CF tasks. The code of our method will be publicly released."

The proposed strategy constrains the tracking errors within a predefined range, enabling the system outputs to track the references with the prescribed speed and accuracy. Furthermore, it is free from the specific information regarding system nonlinearities and disturbances. It also avoids parameter identification, function approximation, derivative calculation and command filtering. Finally, a simulation is conducted to demonstrate the theoretical findings."

To address this issue, an improved VO method is proposed in this paper. The concept of “ship telegraph” is introduced to discretize ship speed, simplifying speed planning and enabling coordinated speed-course planning. A dynamic calculation method for preset safety distance is designed, which integrates ship maneuvering constraints and environmental interaction constraints to determine the safety threshold, providing a basis for collision risk identification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation experiments: comparative experiments show that it outperforms the course-only adjustment method in avoiding collisions; tests with target ships with randomly varying speeds and courses confirm its robustness. This method enhances the adaptability of VO-based collision avoidance in practical maritime navigation, providing a reference for safe ship navigation."

    "abstract": "Mission-critical networks (MCNs) increasingly depend on distributed intelligence for intrusion detection but remain susceptible to adversarial threats and poisoned feedback. As cyber-physical systems scale, ensuring secure and adaptive anomaly detection across heterogeneous, edge-centric environments is vital. Centralized approaches suffer from latency and single points of failure, while conventional federated learning lacks trust and poisoning resilience. These gaps expose MCNs to inference inconsistencies, delayed mitigation, and adversarial manipulation under real-time constraints. This paper presents a federated swarm intelligence framework for secure anomaly detection and adversarial resilience in MCNs. The system integrates a hybrid global-local anomaly detection model, composed of an autoencoder and an isolation forest with a reputation-based belief propagation protocol. Each node performs local inference and shares Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) with trusted peers. Trust scores are dynamically updated using a similarity-weighted belief function, allowing the swarm to isolate poisoned nodes and maintain robust consensus. A self-healing loop filters malicious contributions from global model updates, ensuring continuous adaptation to threat evolution. Experimental results across TON_IoT, CICIDS2017, and UNSW-NB15 datasets demonstrate improved detection accuracy, reduced false positives, and resilience against up to 30% adversarial node participation. This work establishes a scalable defense paradigm for edge-intelligent, real-time MCN environments."

    "abstract": "The Arc Flash study is essential for enhancing electrical safety by determining the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) required when accessing electrical panels. The standard that provides guidelines for the Arc Flash study is NFPA 70E. When calculating incident energy, this standard highlight various methods, with the choice depending on several factors, such as voltage level and whether the arc occurs within a panel or in open air. For voltage levels between 208V and 15kV, the IEEE 1584 calculation method is generally applied. Above 15 kV, if the arc occurs within a panel, extending the IEEE 1584 method can be considered. However, if the arc occurs in open air, Ralph Lee’s method, EPRI, or NESC are used. When high incident energy values are identified, particularly in low-voltage industrial systems, certain mitigation techniques should be recommended in the Arc Flash study. As a best practice, if the incident energy exceeds 8 cal/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, mitigation measures must be proposed. The following options should be assessed based on technical and economic criteria: adjusting the protective device settings, implementing a second set of settings, installing an arc protection relay, or utilizing an Arcing Quenching Device (AQD). Ultimately, if mitigation is not feasible, the panel should only be operated when de-energized. Therefore, it is crucial to apply the appropriate incident energy calculation method while also considering possible energy reduction strategies. To support engineers in selecting the most suitable approach for a given system, an Arc Flash study flowchart will be presented, comparing different solutions to minimize the risk of people injury and equipment damage."

This influence has extended to computer vision (CV), with the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT) achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in areas such as image recognition and object detection. A noted drawback of Transformer architectures is their large number of parameters, which poses a significant challenge, particularly in natural language processing, due to severe GPU memory limitations. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a method for reducing trainable parameters, has been proposed and has garnered considerable attention, primarily in the field of finetuning. This paper analyzes the impact of applying LoRA, originally developed within the Transformer domain, to ViT, which share the same underlying Transformer architecture. The analysis is conducted by fine-tuning pre-trained with ImageNet-21k Dataset and finetuned with ImageNet-1k weights using the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset and the Food-101 Dataset. The training of ViT necessitates a large volume of data. This poses a challenge for finetuning in domains where available datasets contain only a limited number of images. The findings of this investigation reveal a 1-2% improvement in accuracy when using LoRA, and demonstrate a reduction of approximately 5GB in GPU memory under a batch size of 128."

    "abstract": "Self-supervised representation learning has become critical for addressing the annotation bottleneck in skeleton-based human action recognition on consumer electronics devices. However, most existing methods adopt a spatio-temporal decoupled training paradigm, which neglects the inherent synergy between a skeleton’s spatial topology and its temporal dynamics. Even recent hierarchical approaches fail to capture cross-level associations fully, limiting overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Topology-aware Spatio-Temporal Interaction Contrastive Network (TSI-CNet) within a self-supervised framework. Topology-driven spatial masks quantify joint centrality in the skeleton graph to prioritize highly connected nodes. Motion-driven temporal masks dynamically select high-change frames based on inter-frame motion magnitude. A dual-branch decoupling–interaction architecture further disentangles spatial and temporal features and achieves semantic fusion through a cross-domain alignment loss. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show that TSI-CNet achieves competitive performance with a lightweight design. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed topology- and motion-driven masking strategies, and ablation studies further validate the contributions of individual components. Robustness evaluations under seven simulated real-world perturbations also highlight the method’s resilience to spatial and temporal disturbances, underscoring its suitability for consumer applications such as smart cameras, AR/VR devices, and service robots."

    "abstract": "To efficiently use the spectrum and support more users in the wireless communications, the scheme of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed. Although the spectrum can support more users, we need to handle the interference among users. The method of successive interference cancellation is proposed to cancel interference among users, it is used in the scenario that one user has much higher power than the other user. In this work, we consider the joint maximum likelihood (ML) detection in the NOMA system. Although we can apply the exhaustive search (ES) to achieve the optimal ML detection, the ES method has high complexity. Therefore, we consider an improved gradient search (GS) algorithm with efficient jumping search for the detection in the NOMA system. For the QPSK modulation, with two or three users sharing the same spectrum during the same time slot, the simulation shows that using the improved GS algorithm, we can achieve the optimal ML detection as the ES method. We can further consider higher modulation constellation, or the scenarios that users apply different modulation constellations."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel stream allocation algorithm for semi-coherent Cell-Free Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (CF-MU-MIMO) networks. In such networks, groups of phase-coherent Access Points (APs) are organized into clusters that operate coherently inside the clusters, while inter-cluster phase coherence is not maintained, reflecting practical limitations in achieving network-wide synchronization. The proposed algorithm is tailored for multi-cluster service, where multiple clusters can simultaneously serve each User Equipment (UE). To support this flexibility, different stream sequences are constructed for each UE, and each of the sequences is initialized and dynamically constructed based on the strongest links across all serving clusters and the UEs. During the allocation process, both inter-cluster and inter-stream interference are mitigated using projection-based techniques, thereby improving spatial multiplexing efficiency. Compared to the greedy stream allocation which is commonly adopted in the literature as a low-complexity benchmark due to its near-optimal performance in downlink MIMO systems, the proposed method achieves higher performance with only a modest increase in complexity. Furthermore, a significant enhancement in the achievable sum rate is demonstrated relative to single-user-single-cluster allocation strategies in distributed cell-free systems."

    "abstract": "We propose Bi-AGMI (Bidirectional Attention-Gated Motion Injection), a lightweight and efficient framework for keyframe interpolation based on diffusion models. Bi-AGMI introduces a dual-path denoising process that sequentially connects forward and backward sampling trajectories via latent flipping, enabling temporally bounded generation from two keyframes. To enhance consistency between these two trajectories, we design a novel attention-gated fusion mechanism that dynamically injects and blends forward-path attention features into the backward UNet using a learnable gating module. This design improves temporal coherence, mitigates motion ambiguity, and eliminates the need for repeated re-noising. Experiments on DAVIS and Pexels datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive visual quality and inference efficiency compared to recent diffusion-based baselines, while requiring significantly fewer sampling steps. By enabling stable interpolation over large temporal gaps, Bi-AGMI expands the practical usability of diffusion models for long-range video completion."

This paper adopts a VCO-based comparator, due to its ability to adjust noise performance according to the input, which further contributes to the overall reduction in power consumption.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of reactive jamming on LoRaWAN networks, focusing on showing that LoRaWAN communications can be effectively disrupted with minimal jammer exposure time. The susceptibility of LoRa to jamming is assessed through a theoretical study of how the frame success rate is impacted by only a few jamming symbols. Different jamming approaches are studied, among which repeated-symbol jamming appears to be the most disruptive, with sufficient jamming power. A key contribution of this work is the proposal of a software-defined radio (SDR)-based jamming approach implemented on GNU Radio that generates a controlled number of random symbols, independent of the standard LoRa frame structure. This approach enables precise control over jammer exposure time and provides flexibility in studying the effect of jamming symbols on network performance. The theoretical analysis is validated through experimental results, where the implemented jammer is used to assess the impact of jamming under various configurations. Our findings demonstrate that LoRa-based networks can be disrupted with a minimal number of symbols, emphasizing the need for future research on stealthy communication techniques to counter such jamming attacks."

In such networks, active eavesdroppers can launch pilot-spoofing attacks, fully informed of the legitimate pilot sequences and AP-selection scheme, to contaminate UL channel estimation (CE), thereby degrading overall throughput and leaking confidential data to the adversary. To counteract spoofing, we analyze a bi-objective AP-selection framework that jointly maximizes (1) the network sum spectral efficiency (SE) and (2) the secrecy spectral efficiency (SSE) of the attacked UEs. Our results traces the Pareto frontier of sum SE versus attacked UE SE, revealing the inherent trade-offs between throughput and security."

In this paper, a UAV deployment and resource allocation strategy is proposed for the UAV-NOMA based IoT networks. The strategy aims to improve the user connection capability, and comprehensively considers multiple factors such as the UAV height optimization, the users’ transmit power allocation and subcarrier scheduling. Specifically, this proposed strategy is dominated by the genetic algorithm (GA) to achieve the collaborative scheduling of resources by combining power control and channel allocation sub-algorithms. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy has an excellent performance under a variety of system parameter changes, and the average user connection ratio is 10% higher than that of the comparison algorithm. This work provides an effective resource management solution for the UAV-NOMA based system in the future air-ground convergence communication scenario, and thus has good engineering practical value and promotion prospects."

That said, sophisticated methods may replace the conventional beam training overhead. To this end, we propose a novel machine learning-based approach that leverages multi-modal data, combining positional and visual information from the wireless communication environment for efficient beam prediction. Our methodology implements a three-stage framework: transfer learning for initial feature extraction, and it is combined by feature engineering for positional information and systematic feature selection for vision information to identify optimal characteristics, and machine learning model to spot optimal beam. We compared our proposed approach with the original study used the same dataset and scenarios, and experimental results demonstrated significant improvements over the existing methodology used in majority of the results. It achieves the maximum gains for only position in Scenario 5 throughout the top-k accuracies. The gain for top-1 accuracy 35 %, and it is 17 % and 10 % for top-2 and top-3 accuracies in order. The proposed approach also reduces training time by using more simple machine learning algorithms. These findings illustrate that our multi-modal data-driven approach effectively addresses beam alignment challenges in next-generation wireless communications by reducing the beam training overhead and achieve high performance simultaneously, enabling more efficient and reliable mmWave and THz communication systems."

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology plays a key role in automating operations and tracking goods in industries such as logistics and retail. However, communication performance between RFID tags and readers remains highly sensitive to tag orientation and environmental factors. These variations make it difficult to detect and diagnose communication issues in practical, on-site settings. Most existing evaluation tools are optimized for laboratory use and lack support for in-field diagnosis and system tuning. This paper presents a field-oriented platform that enables on-site measurement and assessment of RFID communication quality by integrating handheld RFID readers with cloud-based services. The system transmits communication data, such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and phase values, from the reader to a cloud server. A web-based interface visualizes this data, enabling users to evaluate the impact of tag placement and surrounding conditions remotely. This architecture supports real-time diagnostics and operational decision-making in the field. To validate the platform’s effectiveness, we implemented a prototype and conducted preliminary experiments. The results demonstrate that the system successfully facilitates RFID communication analysis under realistic operating conditions, offering practical benefits compared to conventional lab-centric approaches."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop) framework, designed to enhance generalization performance for downstream tasks at the network edge while simultaneously reducing overhead. Within this framework, we derive a generalization error bound under sparsity regularization, elucidating the theoretical principles that balance underfitting and overfitting. Our analysis shows that a higher dropout rate increases sparsity, lowering the Pointwise Hypothesis Stability (PHS) upper bound and narrowing the gap between empirical and generalization errors. However, this also leads to a higher empirical error, which, together with the gap, contributes to the total generalization error. Consequently, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly considers dropout rate and resource allocation, aiming to minimize the upper bound of the generalization error. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating overfitting and enhancing generalization capabilities."

An important property of a DRA method is to be able to dynamically adapt random access parameters for prevailing backlog load (BLL) conditions. The access points cannot readily know the instantaneous BLL before the RA process is completed and need some simple indirect method to estimate it promptly. To this end we first present an enhancement to indirect BLL estimation that results in a more robust support for the burst traffic changes. Secondly, we evaluate the potential performance gain obtained from the dynamic random access control in a multibeam LEO satellite system that requires beam-level load estimation to work properly in the presence of handovers between moving satellite beams. The results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed DRA approach in multibeam satellite systems in terms of the random access success probability."

    "abstract": "Improving software-managed cache efficiency is an important issue for various modern applications. Although LRU (Least Recently Used) has been widely used as the default replacement policy in many key-value caches, it suffers from low concurrency performance caused by frequent list updates. However, existing concurrency-aware schemes like FIFO sacrifice the LRU’s temporal locality of data access, leading to a drop in the cache’s hit ratio. In this work, aiming to improve the concurrency performance of cache management while maintaining a high hit ratio as LRU, we propose a novel concurrency-aware cache replacement policy called SEMU (SEgment-based MUlti-version cache replacement) that outperforms state-of-the-art schemes. The novelty of SEMU lies in two aspects. First, it uses an appendonly segment-based FIFO list to avoid locking the list, yielding high concurrency performance. Second, it adopts a multi-version mechanism to make the cache aware of the temporal locality of data access, which can offer a high hit ratio as LRU. With such designs, SEMU can offer high concurrency performance and a high hit ratio for the cache. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world workloads to compare SEMU with a few existing schemes, including LRU, FIFO, 2Q, and FrozenHot. We also implement SEMU into a real key-value store, RocksDB, and perform a system-to-system evaluation. The performance comparison under the YCSB workloads shows that SEMU can efficiently improve the performance of RocksDB with the consideration of data concurrency. Particularly, in the multi-thread concurrent environment, SEMU averagely outperforms LRU, 2Q, FIFO, and FrozenHot by up to 1.9×, 1.6×, 80%, and 102% under the synthetic workloads and improves the throughput of RocksDB configured with default settings by up to 59.67% under the system-to-system comparison.</p>"

Adaptive routing algorithms route packets over different available paths to reduce latency and improve network utilization.

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a postprocessing annealing for 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) CMOS technology with the aim of improving the electrical characteristics of the single devices and ICs in terms of uniformity among different dies and repeatability after thermal stress. The postprocessing annealing is performed at 673 K and under different environmental conditions, i.e., ambient, vacuum, and nitrogen, whereas the electrical characteristics are measured for 4H-SiC lateral n-type and p-type metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors and for integrated logic gates up to 673 K and after different thermal ramps. All the postprocessing annealing conditions induce a variation in the threshold voltages for both MOSFETs, whereas the field-effect channel mobilities result almost unchanged. For example, the threshold voltage of NMOSFETs increases, reducing the current by <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$-{9}.{1}\\%$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, and that of PMOSFETs decreases with a rise of the current of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${25}\\%$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, together with a reduction of the hysteresis of subthreshold characteristics, whereas the field-effect channel mobilities are unchanged. Furthermore, 4H-SiC CMOS <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">not</small> logic gates have a shift of the logical threshold toward higher values, very close to the ideal value and a better repeatability of transfer characteristics from room temperature up to 673 K. In a first analysis supported by theoretical models, we can ascribe the effects of the postprocessing annealing to a reduction of the concentration of border traps located in the oxide, which significantly affect the threshold voltage and the subthreshold characteristics, but barely alter the field-effect channel mobility."

    "abstract": "In virtual reality (VR) systems, sensory feedback is inevitably delayed due to computational and system latencies. One potential solution to this problem is to predict the user’s motion and generate avatar movements that slightly precede the user’s current motion based on the prediction. To establish a fundamental criterion for such predictive avatar movements without causing user discomfort, this study investigated perceptually acceptable lead times using the psychophysical method of constant stimuli. While previous studies have focused primarily on acceptable delays in avatar motion, little attention has been given to the perceptual thresholds for motion precedence. In the experiment, participants stood up from a chair while their avatar in the VR environment stood up 0–60 ms earlier. Participants judged, using a two-alternative forced-choice procedure, whether the avatar’s motion preceded their own. Detection thresholds were estimated by fitting the proportion of \"preceded\" responses to a normal cumulative distribution function. Across seven participants, the mean 50% detection threshold was 24.8 ms, and the 84% threshold was 39.7 ms. These findings provide a basis for implementing predictive avatar motion within perceptual tolerance, contributing to more seamless and comfortable VR experiences."

    "abstract": "In movement control by functional electrical stimulation (FES), it is an important issue to solve the problem of trade-off between energy efficiency and accuracy of movement control. A previously proposed FES control method with dynamic modulation of the co-contraction level of antagonistic muscle pairs during movement used a look-up table that determines the stimulation intensity from the co-contraction level and the target angle determined from the current position. However, the method showed a different trajectory from those of healthy subjects, and it required many preliminary stimulations. This study aimed to develop a new FES control method based on the previously proposed FES control method with dynamic modulation of the co-contraction level. In this paper, the validity of the previous control method was examined to clarify problems of the method. The control performance was examined under four conditions, including the assumption that errors occur in movements during FES control. The result showed that this control method could achieve reaching movement while compensating for some errors. However, it was found that the controllable range was limited by the distance between the start and target points of the reaching movement, suggesting the possibility of loss of control depending on the control error."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the crosstalk suppression in small-pitch array high-energy particle (for example, alpha and electron) detectors. As for photodetector arrays, crosstalk between pixels is a phenomenon severely limiting the pixel density, detector resolution, and overall performance of the detector. Addressing this issue, in this paper, a Crosstalk Charge Extraction Structure (CCES) is proposed. CCES mitigates electrical crosstalk via shallow trench isolation (STI) and actively extracts laterally diffused carriers using the potential gradient formed by CCES. Simulation analysis conducted using Sentaurus TCAD demonstrates that CCES can substantially reduce crosstalk effects across various pixel spacings. The as-fabricated detectors indicate that under a reverse bias voltage of 50 V and a load resistance of 50 Ω, the detector integrated with CCES exhibits a rise time of approximately 1.53 ns and a cutoff frequency of approximately 228 MHz. The maximum dark current per unit area does not exceed 16 nA/cm², with an average value of 5.9 nA/cm². Crosstalk tests reveal that compared to traditional structures, CCES reduces crosstalk from approximately 32% to 22% . Furthermore, CCES reconstructs the potential distribution between pixels through a Kelvin-like guard ring design, reducing the mean pixel capacitance from 3.93 pF to 3.59 pF. Importantly, the integration of CCES does not compromise the responsivity or quantum efficiency of the detector. This research provides a critical foundation for the optimal design of high-energy detectors, resolves the trade-off between crosstalk suppression and effective detection area, and enhances detection accuracy and reliability."

    "abstract": "Traffic signal control is one of the most important challenges for resolving traffic congestion in modern cities. Many previous studies that attempted to solve this problem were based on a simulation optimization approach. However, these studies focused on the optimization procedure without considering two fundamental limitations of simulation: designing a simulation environment and running a simulator during optimization. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a simulationoptimization framework using a deep-neural-network-based metamodel. The proposed framework can be summarized in five steps: (1) parameterizing real-world features, such as road networks and traffic demands; (2) constructing sample intersections as simulation environments; (3) gathering training data by running a simulator; (4) fitting the metamodel with the data to predict the output of the simulator; and (5) immediately producing the optimized traffic signal via the trained model whenever a new real instance is provided. Based on numerical experiments, we evaluated the performance of the proposed framework in terms of the prediction accuracy of the metamodel and optimized the solution quality. The experiments show that the proposed framework is comparable with the existing simulation optimization framework in terms of solution quality; however, it significantly reduces the computation time. The experiments also verify that its performance is robust for unseen road networks and traffic demands. Moreover, the metamodel can easily accommodate variants of problems with multi-objective functions or additional constraints, such as the minimum duration of pedestrian crosswalks and fixed cycle lengths."

However, the sparse-to-dense mapping is ambiguous, making it challenging for users to obtain segmentations at the desired granularity and causing them to engage in trial-and-error cycles. Although existing multi-granularity IS models (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>, SAM) alleviate the ambiguity of single-granularity methods by predicting multiple masks simultaneously, this approach has limited scalability and produces redundant results. To address this issue, we introduce a creative granularity-controllable IS paradigm that resolves ambiguity by enabling users to precisely control the segmentation granularity. Specifically, we propose a Unified Granularity Controller (UniGraCo) that supports multi-type optional granularity control signals to pursue unified control over diverse segmentation requirements, effectively overcoming the limitation of single-type control in adapting to different needs, thus boosting the system efficiency and practicality. To mitigate the excessive cost of annotating the multi-granularity masks and the corresponding granularity control signals for training UniGraCo, we construct an automated data engine capable of generating high-quality and granularity-abundant mask-granularity data pairs at low cost. To enable UniGraCo to learn unified granularity controllability in an efficient and stable manner, we further design a granularity-controllable learning strategy. This strategy leverages the generated data pairs to incrementally equip the pre-trained IS model with granularity controllability while preserving its segmentation capability. Extensive experiments on intricate scenarios at both instance and part level demonstrate that our UniGraCo has significant advantages over previous methods, highlighting its potential as a practical interactive tool.

    "abstract": "Cloud Profiling Radars (CPRs) play a crucial role in examining various properties of clouds and precipitation. However, the CPR measurements can be influenced by Doppler velocity errors, noise, clutter, and other contaminations, which may lead to inaccurate estimates of cloud parameters. Doppler velocity is a critical parameter for improving the accuracy of cloud microphysical property retrievals from CPR observations. Velocity folding is a common issue that is caused by finite pulse repetition frequency in CPR systems. Therefore, accurate velocity unfolding is essential for reliable cloud microphysics and dynamics analysis. This paper presents a novel velocity unfolding technique for the 94-GHz high-sensitivity super-polarimetric ice crystal detection and explication radar (HG-SPIDER) in Japan. The technique utilizes the relationship between reflectivity (Z) and Doppler velocity (V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</sub>), their gradients and trends, to identify folded velocity pixels. Then, the folded velocity pixels are corrected based on the Nyquist velocity. The proposed method demonstrates better performance compared to the conventional fixed velocity threshold approach in terms of accuracy, with higher correlation against lidar observations (proposed vs. conventional: R = 0.81 vs. 0.70 in precipitation; R = 0.99 vs. 0.95 in clear-air) and improved one-year statistical metrics (R = 0.86 vs. 0.76). Furthermore, the proposed method was tested on a real-time EarthCARE CPR case study, demonstrating its potential for future integration into JAXA’s Level-2 processing algorithm."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new waveform called discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with chirp modulation (DFT-s-OFDM-CM) is proposed for the next generation of wireless communications. The information bits are conveyed by not only Q-ary constellation symbols but also the starting frequency of chirp signal. It could maintain the benefits provided by the chirped discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM), e.g., low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), full frequency diversity exploitation, etc. Simulation results confirm that the proposed DFT-s-OFDM-CM could achieve higher spectral efficiency while keeping the similar bit error rate (BER) to that of chirped DFT-s-OFDM. In addition, when maintaining the same spectral efficiency, the proposed DFT-s-OFDM-CM with the splitting of information bits into two streams enables the use of lower-order constellation modulation and offers greater resilience to noise, resulting in a lower BER than the chirped DFT-s-OFDM."

    "abstract": "This paper considers a millimeter-wave wideband point-to-point MIMO system with fully digital transceivers at the base station and the user equipment (UE), focusing on mobile UE scenarios. A main challenge when building a digital UE combining is the large volume of baseband samples to handle. To mitigate computational and hardware complexity, we propose a novel two-stage digital combining scheme at the UE. The first stage reduces the N<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</inf> received signals to N<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</inf> streams before baseband processing, leveraging channel geometry for dimension reduction and updating at the beam coherence time, which is longer than the channel coherence time of the small-scale fading. By contrast, the second-stage combining is updated per fading realization. We develop a pilot-based channel estimation framework for this hardware setup based on maximum likelihood estimation in both uplink and downlink. Digital precoding and combining designs are proposed, and a spectral efficiency expression that incorporates imperfect channel knowledge is derived. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms hybrid beamforming, showcasing the attractiveness of using two-stage fully digital transceivers in future systems."

    "abstract": "Polarization reconfigurable (PR) antennas provide a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications, due to their capability of reconfiguring wireless channel state. This paper pursues integrating PR antenna technology into massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system in the scenario that channel state information (CSI) is not provided. We aim to jointly design the polarization and beamforming vectors on both transceivers for simultaneous channel reconfiguration and beam alignment to maximize the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). However, the joint optimization over the polarization and beamforming vectors without perfect CSI is a challenging task. Depolarization increases the dimension of CSI and massive MIMO systems typically have low-dimensional pilot measurement from limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains. This leads to pilot overhead because the transceivers can fulfill only the low-dimensional measurement of the high-dimensional channel. Substantial PR beamforming gain is achieved with significantly reduced pilot overhead, by employing a transformer-based framework on both transceivers to actively design the polarization and beamforming vectors for the pilot stage and transmission stage based on the sequence of received pilots. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework remarkably outperforms the prevalent non-adaptive data-driven methods."

The two issues are studied separately: deep learning is used for channel estimation, and convex optimization is employed for rate maximization. But the step-by-step execution will lead to an increase in computational complexity and algorithmic complexity due to the separate handling of each task. To overcome these limitations, we propose an end-to-end integrated deep learning framework that jointly executes channel estimation and optimizes phase configuration to improve system performance. Specifically, a two-stage deep neural network architecture is introduced, which is trained using a multi-task optimization strategy. Moreover, the optimal network structure was explored by adjusting the scale of each stage and the training weight ratio. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining high system performance."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) confronts cross-domain interference, limited computing capacity and stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-enhanced cloud-edge collaborative framework for ISCC, which achieves multi-dimensional resource synergy through three key innovations. First, a two-tier task offloading architecture is designed, where computational tasks are dynamically allocated to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers and cloud server (CS), breaking the computing capacity bottleneck of standalone edge nodes. Second, leveraging successive interference cancellation (SIC), we develop a dual-domain interference suppression mechanism: intra-functional NOMA decoding eliminates uplink multi-user interference, while coordinated beamforming mitigates cross-functional impacts between communication and sensing signals. Third, we formulate the joint beamforming and resource allocation problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, and propose an alternating direction method of multipliers with alternating optimization (ADMM-AO) algorithm. The algorithm decomposes the NP-hard problem into tractable subproblems via MMSE beamforming, convex-relaxed offloading, and closed-form resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the average computation rate by 29.45% compared to the traditional space division multiple access (SDMA) architecture."

The proposal adopts a hierarchical structure consisting of two long horizon Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies. At the upper level, an MPC-based Inter-Cluster Balancing (ICB) controller computes an optimal common-mode voltage (CMV) reference, enforcing explicit constraints to ensure feasible and effective energy balancing among clusters. At the lower level, Local Cluster Balancing (LCB) is achieved through a Distributed MPC strategy (DMPC-LCB) based on consensus theory. In this architecture, each local controller solves its own constrained optimization problem using only neighbor-to-neighbor communication, enabling modularity, robustness to communication delays, and real-time implementation. The effectiveness of this solution was experimentally validated using a CHB converter composed of 12 SMs, and its performance was assessed against state-of the-art strategies under various conditions, including communication delays, channel failures, and sudden changes in control references."

The method predicts eight continuous fault similarity scores corresponding to distinct and most common mechanical faults. A comprehensive evaluation of five neural network architectures reveals that a Deep Neural Network (DNN) achieves the best overall performance. To bridge the gap between continuous predictions and practical maintenance decisions, a key and novel concept is introduced: a severity-aware fault labeling via an adaptive thresholding mechanism. This framework maps regression outputs to discrete severity labels, enabling reliable and interpretable fault detection that aligns with operational priorities. Experimental results on data from industrial radial fans demonstrate the framework’s robustness and high accuracy, particularly under dynamic operating conditions. This work provides a practical, data-driven diagnostic tool for predictive maintenance strategies in industrial settings."

Magnetic measurements were performed to characterize the present 15 Hz AC performance, and then again with 20 Hz ramp cycle to ensure performance and compatibility in this new operating regime. A 3 m-long curved flat-coil was developed for these measurements using Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology. The probe also has a separate 0.5 m-long body-field probe, allowing integral, body, and end fields to be measured across 100 mm of the magnet aperture. The sampling rate for these measurements during the AC cycle was 200 kHz, and field resolution was better than 0.01%. Details of the probe, measurements, and results are presented."

Our results demonstrate that optimal performance (test accuracy: 0.993, F1 score: 0.993) is achieved with a 4 -second window, $5 \\%$ overlap, 6 input signals, 50 Hz frequency, and filtering. For 7 gestures, the best accuracy decreases to 0.888, highlighting increased complexity. Smaller windows (2 s) or accelerometer-only inputs significantly degrade performance, with accuracies below 0.85. The LSTM model outperforms traditional methods, such as random forest, particularly for larger gesture sets, while reducing the number of preprocessing steps and computational costs.

Traditional SMO systems are limited by rigid interfaces and fixed monitoring views, increasing operational risk. This paper proposes an Intent-Based Networking (IBN) approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) together with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable high-level, intent-driven control of network functions. Since LLMs can produce hallucinated or inaccurate responses, RAG addresses this by grounding the output in real-time network data, significantly improving reliability. We demonstrate two key applications within a 5G/6G SMO framework: (1) conversational monitoring of RAN/Core KPIs and (2) dynamic orchestration of network functions like UPFs (Core) and RICs (RAN). A third area—(3) optimization through AI-driven xApps/rApps—is part of our ongoing work and will further support performance and energy efficiency goals. Experiments show ≈90% response accuracy in our Intelligent Network Management (INM) use case, highlighting the potential for autonomous, zero-touch operations."

    "abstract": "One of the most common types of cancer in the world is skin cancer, and successful treatment and higher patient survival rates depend on early detection. Manual examination and clinical knowledge are the mainstays of traditional diagnostic techniques, which can be laborious and subjective. In this paper, skin image classification is carried out using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our approach classifies dermoscopic images into three categories: benign, malignant, and normal. The proposed system achieves an accuracy of $84.14 \\%$ in the test data set, with a class-specific F1 score of 0.95 for normal, 0.85 for benign and 0.78 for malignant cases. We implement comprehensive data preprocessing techniques and a custom CNN architecture, demonstrating the system’s potential as a reliable support tool for dermatologists in early skin cancer detection."

    "abstract": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) at the wireless edge is a promising solution to meet the low-latency, high-computation demands of next-generation AI applications. Although the existing literature has introduced approaches to enable distributed LLM inference, these methods largely overlook the distinct computational and communication characteristics of the two-phase LLM inference process—the pre-fill and decode phases. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance and limits scalability in real-world deployments. To address these issues, we propose a novel collaborative inference framework that strategically minimizes inference latency by optimally distributing computational loads across edge devices, the edge server, and the cloud. Our approach introduces a hybrid framework that combines head-wise parallel processing with layer-wise partitioning of LLM models, supported by a dual-phase optimization strategy. In the pre-fill phase, we optimize assigning attention heads to selected edge devices for parallel computation and efficient resource use. We then optimize for minimal latency by selecting participants, determining head assignments per device, and allocating bandwidth while meeting all constraints. In the de-code phase, our framework adaptively decides whether to execute computations locally on the edge server, offload them to the cloud, or redistribute tasks among edge devices, optimizing this decision based on the remaining latency budget and the sequential nature of the decode phase. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving a 56% reduction in inference latency, 40% improvement in bandwidth efficiency and 35% improvement in resource utilization."

To address the extreme system heterogeneity from different environments, CFVLC introduces an optimization problem that jointly performs device selection and resource allocation to minimize training latency across the network. We propose a two-stage heuristic solution that intelligently balances user participation across environments with varying resources and channel conditions.

Human skeletons are extracted from video using AlphaPose, and joint coordinates are interpolated from 13 to 25 joints to match BlockGCN input requirement. The model was trained on a subset of the NTU RGB+D dataset, focusing on seven fall-related actions, and evaluated using videos from side, front, and rear views. Results show that BlockGCN improved fall detection accuracy by approximately 40% compared to ST-GCN, achieving up to 100% in certain scenarios."

This work considers a transmitter-receiver pair communicating over an unreliable channel with time-varying reliability levels. The transmitter observes the instantaneous link reliability through a channel state information acquisition procedure, during which the data transmission is interrupted. This leads to a fundamental trade-off between utilizing limited network resources for either data transmission or channel state information acquisition to combat the channel aging effect. Assuming the wireless channel is modeled as a finite-state Markovian channel, we formulate an optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), obtain the optimal policy through the relative value iteration algorithm, and demonstrate the efficiency of our solution through simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to aim for an optimal scheduling policy for data transmissions while considering the effect of channel state information aging."

While most nematodes feed on bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms, a small fraction are parasitic to humans, livestock, or crops, attracting special attention from nematologists. For instance, root-knot and root lesion nematodes cause billions of dollars in annual crop losses. Due to their microscopic size and need to extract them from their habitats, identifying and counting nematodes is labor-intensive and time-consuming task conducted by specially trained nematologists. To address this, an RGB microscope nematode image dataset, designed for nematode counting and related research, was developed. This study explored and fine-tunes several object detection models, including You Only Look Once (YOLO) models, Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), and Florence-2, for accurate nematode detection. In the results, most models achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50) around 0.7, with YOLOv8 outperforming the others, achieving a mAP@50 of 0.75 and an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}$</tex> of 0.9 for nematode counting.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has emerged as a promising solution for UW communication; however, its performance heavily depends on dynamic subcarrier selection to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. This paper presents MERMAID, a novel framework based on a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) approach for adaptive subcarrier selection in Underwater Acoustic Networks (UANs). MERMAID dynamically activates subcarriers based on real-time Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) feedback to maximize reliability while minimizing energy consumption. Unlike Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques, which require extensive training and high computational overhead, MERMAID is specifically designed for resource-constrained UW nodes, enabling fast convergence and lightweight operation. We implement MERMAID in the DESERT simulator and benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art DRL baselines. Simulation results show that MERMAID improves PDR by up to 21.15% and reduces energy consumption by up to 45.40%. These findings highlight MERMAID as a scalable, efficient, and high-performance solution for real-world Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) applications. The framework aligns with the 6G vision by advancing intelligent and energy-efficient connectivity in harsh environments, highlighting its potential to extend communication paradigms to UW networks."

    "abstract": "Deploying small cells to densify heterogeneous networks (HetNets) provides a scalable way to meet the growing demand for diverse mobile services. Aggressive frequency reuse in ultra-dense networks (UDNs) further enhances spectral efficiency but intensifies inter-cell interference. With intelligent management, this interference can be harnessed to strengthen network-wide physical layer security (PLS). To this end, and in line with green-security principles, we propose that base stations collaboratively shape interference and deploy rechargeable jamming mines (RJMs) to expand secure zones by injecting targeted jamming around potential eavesdroppers, eliminating the need for dedicated jammers. To realize this, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which each BS independently optimizes beam orientation, transmit power, resource block allocation, and RJM activation under a zero-trust model that treats every location as a potential eavesdropper. A hybrid reward function aligns local actions with network-wide security goals, and state-dependent action masking reduces the policy search space. Extensive results show that the proposed approach substantially enlarges secure-area coverage, scales efficiently in ultra-dense deployments, and establishes a practical, sustainable foundation for collaborative PLS in next-generation wireless networks."

Specifically, data intelligence utilizes virtual data generation engines to adaptively generate virtual data and leverages blockchain to ensure the trustworthy circulation of data. Model intelligence establishes a trusted federated model factory integrating large and small models, achieving personalized model generation and bidirectional knowledge optimization between large and small models. Decision intelligence designs multi-agent collaborative mechanisms to generate specialized decision solutions and support self-optimization.

Without selectively denoising, we may fail to detect iris regions correctly, which is undesirable. We augment the iris images by smoothing and rotating the iris images many times. We train our CNNs with the augmented iris images and then classify the unknown iris images to known classes. Experiments demonstrate that our new method achieves very high recognition rates even when random noise is introduced to the dataset for iris recognition."

It was found that Greenwood’s method is reasonably accurate when separation of the contact spots is at least several spot sizes (5 or 6 diameters). When the proximity falls below this level the individual spot constrictions become distorted and adjacent spots appear to merge and exhibit single spot behavior. It is believed that this conclusion is valid for real contact interfaces having varying spot sizes and shapes."

To this end, this study proposes a multi-sensor fusion positioning scheme to improve system robustness through heterogeneous data complementation. Aiming at the key problems of multi-source data fusion, Pearson correlation is used to quantify the positioning contribution of each sensor, and an adaptive weight distribution mechanism is established.

We present an annotation-free pipeline that integrates unsupervised geometric priors with diffusion-based inpainting to visualise postoperative results. Structural constraints are derived from edge-based features within a standardised periocular region of interest, avoiding reliance on segmentation or landmarks while ensuring anatomical plausibility. We evaluate the pipeline on 131 paired preopera-tive-postoperative eyelid surgery samples under a zero-shot, cross-domain setting without fine-tuning or retraining. Quantitative results demonstrate strong performance across three dimensions: identity preservation, boundary consistency and perceptual quality. Qualitative analyses further confirm that the model produces natural, continuous creases aligned with postoperative morphology, while maintaining subject-specific identity and seamless blending. These findings highlight the feasibility of combining geometric priors with generative diffusion models for the prediction of interpretable and reproducible outcomes. While some failures remain in underrepresented subgroups, the proposed zero-shot, annotation-free workflow demonstrates potential as a lightweight tool for surgical visualisation, with applicability beyond eyelid surgery to broader aesthetic and reconstructive domains."

As a representative technology of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), tongue diagnosis learns the patient's physical condition and pathological level by observing the changes of tongue texture and tongue coating, therefore this field has attracted more and more attention. However, the standard tongue diagnosis depends on empirical judgment, and there is no standard paradigm. In light of this, this study proposes a fusion diagnosis architecture that combines deep learning and manual features. Firstly, a multi-layer nested segmentation model is proposed to achieve more accurate tongue segmentation in complex backgrounds; Then, manual features are extracted from the segmented tongue region, and a machine learning classifier is used for attribute recognition. This method not only improves the segmentation accuracy, but also enhances the transparency and clinical credibility of the model through interpretable manual features, and provides an effective solution for tongue diagnosis automation."

    "abstract": "This paper studies the coexistence between a geosynchronous Equatorial orbit (GEO) satellite at nadir and a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite. Both satellites operate in the Q/V frequency band, identified as potential candidate for the service link of 6G non-terrestrial communications. The two satellites on different orbits use either the same communication channel or adjacent channels. As a consequence, communications between the satellites and their associated user equipment on Earth are subject to interference in both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), thus reducing the throughput. The level of experienced interference depends on the LEO satellite elevation, and on the adjacent channel interference ratio (ACIR) in case of adjacent channel interference. The coexistence results obtained for both DL and UL of the two considered orbits provide guidelines regarding the maximum elevation for the LEO satellite at which the 3GPP requirements are fulfilled. For instance, the required value of ACIR with respect to the maximum acceptable throughput loss is hereby evaluated."

    "abstract": "A slip ring using sliding electrical contacts is the typical \"go to\" solution for transferring electrical power and data across a rotating interface. As digital data rates and rotational speeds continue to increase and maintenance requirements become more demanding, slip ring limitations are becoming problematic in some applications. There are four technologies that are being used to address these limitations; two of these solutions are used for data and two are used for power and control. The two data solutions are contactless electrical data transfer and fiber optic rotary joints, and the two power and control solutions are roll rings (rolling electrical contacts) and rotary transformers. All four of these technologies can be used to address limitations of slip rings and provide a reliable, high performance rotary joint. Although these technologies each address inherent weaknesses in sliding contacts, they are not without their own disadvantages. Consequently, these slip ring alternatives have all been slow to make their way into commercially available hardware despite their initial appeal. This review will demonstrate relative advantages and disadvantages of these technical solutions and will highlight promising applications for their implementation."

    "abstract": "Press-fit zones, originally designed as simple square solid cross-sections for the telecommunications industry, have now become integral to a wide range of applications, from automotive to consumer electronics. Over time, these square pins have been adapted into different shapes and sizes to meet diverse application needs and environmental conditions. Typically, a press-fit zone is inserted into a printed circuit board (PCB) hole, forming a stable, gas-tight connection with the plated through-hole. The overall performance of press-fit zones is largely influenced by both the design of the press-fit and the surface finish of the PCB. The PCB itself has undergone significant advancements, especially in surface finishes. Traditionally, hot air solder leveling was commonly used, but with the introduction of lead-free regulations, alternative finishes have emerged. Among the most commonly used finishes for press-fit applications are immersion tin (ImSn), favored in Europe for its cost-effectiveness, electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) and immersion silver (ImAg) for their superior electrical properties, and organic solderability preservatives (OSP), which are increasingly popular in Asia due to their affordability. While extensive research has been conducted on PCB surface finishes alone and their individual benefits and drawbacks, the interaction between press-fit zones and these finishes is still underexplored. This paper examines the interconnection performance of commonly used press-fit zone designs—such as spring shape and eye of needle with PCB finishes including ENIG, ImSn, ImAg, and OSP. Through extensive testing, we analyze insertion and retention forces, contact resistance, and long-term stability to determine the impact of these surface finishes on press-fit performance. The findings provide valuable insights for optimizing press-fit technology in various applications, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of electronic assemblies."

    "abstract": "Increasing industry demand for a safe work environment has contributed to the proposition of solutions for the mitigation of arcing fault consequences on equipment and operational staff. This has been intensified after arc flash risk was recognized around the world as a danger no less important than electric shock. The latest arc quenching technology utilizes a power electronics-based switching device, consisting of two antiparallel thyristors connected in series with a current-limiting impedance. Upon detection of an arcing fault within the busbar of a switchgear or motor control center, the device activates instantaneously, extinguishing the arc within microseconds. This leads to a near-complete elimination of incident energy. The main advantage of this technology is the possibility of multiple usages without the substitution of any component after an operation, as well as the ability of real-time monitoring of the electronic devices for a reliable operation. On the other hand, the main concern is the application of power semiconductors under off-label conditions, which brought the demand for a deep study on the data sheet ratings and development/validation of a design strategy. This work presents the prototype of such a device, which has been drawn and built for power systems up to 440 V, 25 kA (three-phase, symmetrical bolted fault level), as well as experimental results of tests performed in the laboratory. The premises adopted for the design of the equipment are briefly discussed, and the test setup is described along with oscillograms and image captures of the developing/extinguishing faults. The tests have been progressively executed from low to high voltage and current levels, without and with the actuation of the equipment."

    "abstract": "The rise of embodied intelligence in autonomous vehicles, driven by software-defined capabilities, demands a fundamental shift in their underlying Electrical/Electronic (E/E) architectures. While centralized architectures promise the computational power for advanced autonomy, they introduce critical challenges in ensuring safety and cybersecurity. The consolidation of mixed-criticality functions on shared hardware creates significant risks of fault propagation and vulnerability to cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a hypervisor-driven frame-work that provides a resilient foundation for intelligent vehicles. We present an E/E architecture that leverages a Type-1 hypervisor to enforce hardware-level isolation between functions. By partitioning the system into independent virtual machines, we safely co-locate ASIL-D (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) tasks with general-purpose applications, preventing interference and containing threats. Our evaluation demonstrates that this partitioned architecture improves fault coverage by 21.4% compared to non-isolated approaches, significantly enhancing system resilience. This approach ensures that the vehicle’s intelligent systems operate safely, securely, and deterministically, even under complex, dynamic conditions."

Building on that, in this paper, we introduce SHIELD, the first RF-Fencing algorithm that partitions the PWE into Signal Suppression Areas (SSAs) and Signal Delivery Areas (SDAs) through on-the-fly merging of RIS configurations. Extensive EM analysis confirms SHIELD’s effectiveness in preventing wardens from intercepting critical information and achieving covert communications with minimal impact on legitimate users. Moreover, SHIELD can serve also as a jamming-mitigation mechanism and is applicable across various frequency bands and RIS designs."

This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven framework for intelligent service feasibility, qualification, and provisioning in 5G networks, to automate consumer slicing. By leveraging real-time data from the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN), along with Service Quality Indicator (SQI), the framework enables dynamic resource allocation, predictive service qualification, and proactive slice optimization. Key innovations of the frame-work include the coherent integration of AI-driven slice load prediction, mobility-aware service provisioning, and automated QoS assurance via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), ensuring optimal performance for consumer applications while maintaining compliance with Service Level Agreement (SLA).

    "abstract": "Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction plays a critical role in lithium-ion battery (LIB) health management and predictive maintenance. However, existing models exhibit limited temporal modeling capabilities and often neglect spatial features, hindering their ability to learn complex battery degradation patterns. In addition, current RUL prediction frameworks fail to balance interpretability of optimization objectives with prediction accuracy. To address these issues, a Transformer-enhanced spatiotemporal model called BatFormer and an auxiliary learning-based RUL prediction framework named ALF are proposed. BatFormer extracts temporal and spatial features from historical battery data in parallel, and employs a lightweight gating mechanism for feature fusion, offering an effective solution for modeling complex battery degradation patterns from a spatiotemporal perspective. ALF treats RUL regression as the primary task and state of health (SOH) prediction as an auxiliary task, using degradation-oriented learning to support outcome-oriented learning, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy while improving the interpretability of the optimization objective. Furthermore, ALF is plug-and-play and can be directly integrated into any temporal model to improve its RUL prediction performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of BatFormer and ALF, model and framework comparison experiments were conducted on two widely used public datasets: NASA and CALCE. The results demonstrate that BatFormer significantly outperforms existing models in RUL prediction, and all models show varying degrees of accuracy improvement when integrated with ALF."

A critical factor in optimizing performance in these systems is the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), which must be tailored to individual users. However, conventional calibration procedures that explore multiple SOAs are time-consuming and burdensome. In this study, we propose a novel approach to estimate the individual optimal SOA using simulated event-related potentials (ERPs) derived from a single baseline recording with a long SOA. These simulated responses are evaluated using the discriminability-based information transfer rate (dITR) to identify the SOA that best balances speed and accuracy for each user. Our method effectively captures inter-individual variability, including in ALS patients. The optimized SOAs were consistent with those used in previous studies. Furthermore, EEG data were collected using an affordable consumer-grade device (approx. USD 1,000), demonstrating practical feasibility. The findings support the use of adaptive, individualized SOA selection to enhance communication efficiency in real-world BCI applications."

Clustering performance is evaluated before and after imputation by adding different missingness percentages to the dataset. A new method uses FCM-based cluster centers and membership degrees to fill in missing data, focusing on the reliability and compatibility of the imputation process. The findings show significant improvements in clustering quality after imputation, as measured by metrics such as the Silhouette score and intra-cluster variance. The robustness of FCM as a clustering technique with different similarity measures for imputation is demonstrated in this work.

Then, the key generation process involves several stages, including quantization, reconciliation, and privacy amplification, ensuring that the resulting keys are secure and synchronized across participants. Blockchain technology is then leveraged to securely commit these keys, ensuring that the key agreements are recorded in a decentralized, tamper-resistant ledger. The proposed method effectively combines the physical-layer properties of CSI with the decentralized nature of blockchain, providing robust protection against eavesdropping and tampering attacks. Theoretical analyses and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of key mismatch probability and secrecy capacity.

Through extensive simulations, we prove that the proposed UAV-based aerial RIS-aided uplink NOMA network significantly enhances the max-min fair rate."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in consumer electronic UAV and its technology have enhanced public trust in drone-based aerial imaging for disaster prevention, particularly in fire detection. With lightweight design, real-time responsiveness, and high efficiency, drones are increasingly used for rapid deployment and aerial surveillance. Moreover, by equipping with optical, thermal, and laser sensors, drones can detect abnormal high-temperature zones and feedback real-time data to ground stations, improving situational awareness and decision-making. To this purpose, key capabilities include irregular flame recognition, fire source estimation, tracking, and spatial coordinate marking, which are essential for timely response and effective resource allocation. This paper focuses on the drone-based fire source localization techniques to support modern fire management systems. Experimental simulation demonstrates the concept of fire source marking system."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence and computer vision have spurred growing interest in understanding human behavior and emotional states from a third-person perspective. In real-world applications such as security, public guidance, and AI-based scene understanding, it is often necessary to infer emotional states without direct interaction, relying instead on surrounding contextual and interpersonal cues. However, many existing studies rely solely on facial expressions and fail to capture emotions embedded in complex social or situational contexts. Although prior research has attempted to incorporate contextual information, the use of temporal dynamics remains limited. To address this, we propose a method that dynamically selects frames based on inter-frame visual dissimilarity. Experimental results show that our approach effectively captures temporal transitions and enhances the accuracy of continuous emotion recognition in third-person scenarios. Evaluations on the VEATIC dataset, which provides valence and arousal annotations in realistic and socially grounded settings, demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline that uses uniformly sampled frame sequences."

    "abstract": "The Mission-critical IIoT (MC-IIoT) networks are highly interconnected and distributed to ensure real-time monitoring and control, where security, reliability, and availability are paramount. These features make MC-IIoT networks vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that must be mitigated while combating single-point of failure of attack detection systems, limited scalability of industrial control systems, high latency and low reliability. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based DDoS attack mitigation framework for MC-IIoT networks which persuades these requirements. Initially, a machine learning-based cascaded model consisting of an autoencoder-enhanced decision tree model and a lightweight isolation forest algorithm performs attack detection and trust score evaluation of IIoT devices. A consortium Blockchain network of IIoT gateways on which this cascaded model is installed performs attack mitigation using a chaincode based on previously evaluated trust scores. The proposed model is evaluated on Hyperledger Fabric and the performance is analyzed with Hyperledger caliper benchmarking. The comparative analysis of the proposed framework with state-of-the-art proves its effectiveness in terms of attack detection accuracy (99.93%), CPU utilization (30%), decreased latency (12.5 ms), increased throughput (21%), chaincode execution time (3 ms) and attack detection rate (99.6%)."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet client limitations in restricted computational power, memory, storage, and bandwidth, pose significant challenges for FL training and execution efficiency. This paper introduces FedMapTCS, a novel hybrid method that enhances FL communication efficiency by integrating FedMap, a technique for gradually learning a sparse FL model, with time-correlated sparsification (TCS) and error accumulation. This approach allows clients to collaboratively train an increasingly sparse global model, reducing communication overhead from the start of the training by selectively transmitting only necessary parameters each round. Extensive evaluation in both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings demonstrates that FedMapTCS reduces communication bits by over 60% compared to the FedMap baseline and over 85% compared to federated averaging (FedAvg), while maintaining comparable model performance in IID settings. Under non-IID settings, FedMapTCS achieves better accuracy with up to 3.25× fewer rounds than FedMap, and achieves similar accuracy with 24.7% fewer parameters, highlighting its adaptability to heterogeneous data while maintaining performance. This communication efficiency gain positions FedMapTCS as a promising and effective solution for resource-constrained FL environments."

In particular, the high mobility, intermittent connectivity and long communication delays in LEO satellite networks significantly impact FL convergence and model performance. To address these challenges, we formulate a device selection optimization problem that determines the optimal subset of LEO satellites to participate in global model aggregation at each round. The objective is to minimize the average loss while satisfying latency constraints. To solve the formulated problem, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution that enables adaptive satellite selection considering the stochastic nature of satellite connectivity and channel variability. The proposed framework selects participating satellites dynamically based on their communication latency and computational capabilities to improve the overall efficiency of the FL process. Simulation results show that the proposed approach accelerates convergence compared to conventional synchronous FL while maintaining model accuracy."

First, a RIS phase response model accounting for hardware nonlinearities is constructed, with polynomial expansion characterizing the nonlinear mapping between incident signal intensity and reflection phase. Second, a composite interference model integrating multipath effects, sinusoidal disturbances, and random noise is designed—multipath interference is simulated by time-varying delays, random phases, and attenuation coefficients, while sinusoidal disturbances represent periodic electromagnetic interference. Furthermore, a PSO-RIS joint optimization framework is adopted, taking the minimization of positioning error bound (PEB) as the objective function and introducing L1-norm regularization constraints to enhance solution sparsity and suppress false multipath interference. Experimental results demonstrate that under various interferences, the PSO algorithm achieves higher positioning accuracy than the traditional quasi-Newton algorithm."

We conducted a study to verify the damage mode and further inform the industry on the presently widespread practice of uncapped connectors. Replicate connectors were deployed in the summer of 2023 in: hot-dry Barstow, CA; subtropical Gaithersburg, MD; and ocean side Prince Edward Island, CAN. Connectors were returned and then additionally aged using combined-accelerated stress testing (C-AST). Characterizations included: visual and thermographic imaging, resistance-current sweep, HiPot wet leakage insulation, and scanning electron microscopy (morphology and composition, surface and depth-profiling). Deconstructed samples (from the field and after C-AST) showed overt differences between outdoor locations, including: morphology (surface cracking), contamination (minerals, salts, and organic matter), and chemical integrity (surface scale and corrosion). While the performance of field-aged, uncapped connectors was not immediately distinguished from plugged or unaged connectors, all uncapped specimen assemblies ultimately failed C-AST. The humid locations failed 3 - 5 test sequences earlier than the hot-dry location, emphasizing the adverse impact of water and salt. Having confirmed the damage mode of uncapped connectors from simple, prolonged exposure to the outdoor environment, we recommend to always use the manufacturer’s protective end caps, from the time of module manufacture until PV is fully installed in the field."

LoRa modulation is a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technique with orthogonal signaling, which results in low spectral efficiency but enables a low error rate even at relatively low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this paper, we propose a semi-coherent detection scheme that performs coherent detection using estimated channel state information (CSI) in multipath channel environments, which is obtained from the decision results of noncoherent detection. This scheme not only achieves performance close to that of coherent detection but also eliminates the need for pilot signal transmission, which is required in conventional coherent detection schemes at the expense of spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed semi-coherent detection scheme is close to that of coherent detection under various channel conditions."

However, such beams are susceptible to beam misalignment (BM) fading caused by platform instability. While statistical models for BM fading exist for communication links, their extension to sensing applications, especially in drone-to-drone (D2D) scenarios, remains unexplored. In D2D ISAC networks, misalignment effects from the aerial platforms impact both the forward and return paths. This paper presents closed-form statistical models for BM fading in THz ISAC, addressing both monostatic (co-located transceivers) and bistatic (separated transceivers) sensing configurations, and considering both the spot-filling regime (target larger than beam) and the spot-limited regime (target smaller than beam). The proposed models facilitate the extension of BM fading analysis to sensing in drone-to-drone THz ISAC systems and have been validated through Monte Carlo simulations."

    "abstract": "The solar array (SA) serves as the sole energy source for satellites, continuously converting sunlight into electricity to power satellite operations. Sensors placed at key locations on the SA monitor critical parameters in real time, such as irradiance, voltage, current, and temperature, providing essential data for predictive modeling and on-orbit operations and maintenance. Existing predictive modeling methods for SA are broadly categorized into physical models and data-driven models. However, high-fidelity physical models for current prediction often rely on complex architectures and extensive computations due to the intricate operating modes of satellites. Meanwhile, conventional data-driven approaches struggle to capture the full range of operating modes and rapid transitions, limiting the ability to extract dynamic features from the sensing data. To address these challenges, this article proposes an enhanced recursive multi-step current prediction method that incorporates sensor-driven operating mode perception. The contribution lies in leveraging probabilistic modeling to enhance temporal convolutional networks for accurate operating mode perception, matching appropriate predictor libraries, and proposing an attention-enhanced recursive framework (AERF) for multi-step current prediction. A key advantage lies in the ability of attention-enhanced frameworks to adaptively perform multi-step current prediction on raw telemetry data, guided by the identified operating modes. The proposed method maintains high fidelity during abrupt operating mode transitions, reducing exposure bias and minimizing cumulative errors in multi-step predictions. Experimental validation on geostationary satellites demonstrates that the proposed method reduces mean squared errors by over 56% compared with physical models. Relative to a data-driven sequence prediction baseline, it further reduces the mean squared error of ten-step current prediction by more than 37%. These improvements highlight the effectiveness of the method in accurately modeling and predicting satellite SA output current under diverse operating modes."

In this article, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based framework for outlier detection that utilizes structural re-parameterization to enhance inference efficiency. During training, the framework employs a multi-branch convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to enrich feature representations, thereby enhancing the discriminative capability of the detector. After training, structural re-parameterization transforms the multi-branch architecture into an equivalent single-path topology for inference, significantly accelerating the inference process without compromising detection accuracy. The resulting scheme thus adopts different network structures for training and inference, achieving an effective balance between detection performance and computational cost. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with existing approaches, reducing the average runtime to one third of that of mainstream methods while improving the SINR by more than 5 dB."

    "abstract": "The distributed deep learning architecture between front-deployed sensors and edge-deployed gateways attracts increasing interest. However, the inference performance of distributed deep models is also impacted by the delivery loss of intermediate representation in the wireless link, especially in the harsh industrial fading environments. Traditional communication systems usually focus on transmission errors at bit level, which treat all bits in the packets equally and fail to suit the varying importance in distributed deep models, which urges the essential evolution of the communication method to form a joint co-design paradigm for distributed deep models. This article then proposes to optimize the Mean Time To First Failure (MTTFF) of wireless link instead of traditional bit error rate, which enables a guaranteed transmission window. This paper first derives the analytical model of MTTFF under MIMO systems, then utilizes the kernel mixture distribution to obtain a closed-form solution of MTTFF, which forms a optimization algorithm minimizing the transmitted power while achieving the aiming MTTFF. Extensive reallife experiments show more than 70% satisfaction rate of MTTFF, which leads to more than 10 times higher inference accuracy than the original deep model."

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the appropriate definitions of the Brillouin zones and unit cells for glide-symmetric structures. In addition to translational periodicity, such structures possess glide symmetry; that is, invariance after a translation and a mirroring. Starting from basic concepts, we show that defining glide-symmetric structures only by their translational periodicity leads to dispersion diagrams that are less clear and practical, similar to the effect observed when unnecessarily large periods are employed. In particular, we observe that the anisotropy of the structure is incorrectly assessed when following the definitions commonly adopted in the existing literature. Therefore, we introduce a modeling technique utilizing the multi-modal transfer matrix method. This method can incorporate glide-periodicity effectively, leading to an efficient solution as it operates with a reduced computational domain. It also leads to the demonstration of the effects of misleading definitions on various commonly used geometric configurations in the literature. The framework described here is applicable to any glide-symmetric structure and facilitates the comparison of different types of unit cells."

    "abstract": "Recently, the construction of renewable energy generation systems in uninhabited areas such as deserts and oceans has increased significantly, along with the low-carbon transition of the global energy system. However, the traditional planning methods that rely on information from nearby meteorological stations often yield suboptimal planning schemes due to the vastness of the uninhabited areas and significant meteorological spatiotemporal differences. Therefore, an information value-driven comprehensive benefit evaluation method is proposed in this article to efficiently and accurately evaluate suitable locations for renewable power generation system. The information matrix of geo-meteorological coupling is constructed through the numerical weather prediction correction method of Fourier ForeCasting Neural Network. To replace the traditional time-consuming planning method based on traversal optimization, a comprehensive evaluation method that fully considers the value of information itself and its multi-dimensional values such as economy, safety, and low-carbon for the planning scheme is proposed in this paper. Case study based on the Tengger Desert in China is carried out to verify the efficiency of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Existing zero-shot deepfake detection methods are often constrained to specific scenarios and struggle in diverse, complex scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a universal zero-shot deepfake detection method. This method models the common forgery traces across different domains as domain-invariant features and introduces a novel domain-invariant meta-learning strategy. This strategy embeds the mechanism of domain-invariant learning into a meta-learning framework, enabling the model not only to extract specific domain-invariant features from certain domains, but also to leverage the meta-learning mechanism of fast adaptation to new domains. As a result, the model is capable of effectively capturing the intrinsic domain-invariant characteristics of deepfake images, thereby achieving universal zero-shot deepfake detection. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the highest average detection AUC (86.96%) across 28 unseen datasets, representing an improvement of 8.02% over the second-best method (78.94%). Moreover, it is the only method that is effective in all four zero-shot scenarios, which strongly validates its superior zero-shot detection performance and universality.

Existing studies typically formulated different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise a spatio-sequential prompt encoder (SSP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial and sequential relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances.

Methods: Unlike existing approaches that rely on auto-differentiation or that are restricted to specific projector types, our method is based on a general analytical gradient formulation for forward/backprojection in the continuous domain. A key insight is that the gradients of both forward and back-projection can be expressed directly in terms of the forward and back-projection operations themselves, providing a unified gradient computation scheme across different projector types. Leveraging this analytical formulation, we develop a discretized implementation with an acceleration strategy that balances computational speed and memory usage. Results: Simulation studies illustrate the numerical accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for multiple X-ray imaging tasks we conducted. In 2D/3D registration, the proposed method achieves <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim$</tex-math></inline-formula>8× speedup over an existing differentiable forward projector while maintaining comparable accuracy. In motion-compensated analytical reconstruction and cone-beam CT geometry calibration, the proposed method enhances image sharpness and structural fidelity on real phantom data while showing significant efficiency advantages over existing gradient-free and gradient-based solutions. Conclusion: The proposed differentiable projectors enable effective and efficient gradient-based solutions for X-ray imaging tasks requiring rigid motion estimation."

    "abstract": "Recent research on motion generation and text-to motion synthesis focus on coarse-grained motion descriptions, neglecting fine-grained motion details and motion quality refinement. Additionally, current text-to-motion models, such as MotionGPT, lack multi-turn interaction capabilities, relying on single-turn and single-modality transformations, which limit their ability to integrate information from different modalities across interaction stages. These gaps leave critical questions, such as “Howwell is the motion performed” and “How can it be refined?” largely unaddressed. To address these issues, first, we introduce two fine-grained dance datasets—one focusing on jazz dance and the other on folk dance, which we have independently collected. Second, considering that dance motions are inherently complex and consist of long sequential actions, we introduce both global and local optimization during the motion encoding phase and employ Hidden Markov Model (HMM) temporal modeling to capture differential features between correct and incorrect movements, thereby optimizing the training process. Finally, we propose a multi-turn historical dialogue framework that enables three stages generation—motion assess, text instructions, and motion refinement—for input videos. This framework assists dance beginners by providing feedback on their movements, offering textual instructions, and delivering motion-based refinement. Experimental results on the jazz dance and folk dance datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative metrics, establishing a new benchmark for motion-text generation in the field of dance training."

In SE, multiple users jointly occupy a high-dimensional embedding space and are separated by learnable user-specific positional masks together with attention-driven demultiplexing, so that inter-user interference is suppressed directly in the embedding domain. The resulting interference structure closely resembles interference alignment (IA), wherein residual multiuser energy is compressed into a low-rank subspace that the decoder can effectively attenuate. We develop closed-form expressions for signal power, effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), symbol error rate (SER), and per-user capacity, explicitly characterizing the roles of intra-user coherence and an alignment coefficient that quantifies attention-induced interference suppression. These formulas yield theoretical baselines that situate SE performance between a no-alignment lower bound and an ideal non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired upper bound and explain capacity gains in dense regimes via statistical multiplexing and alignment. Experimental evaluations are carried out under Rayleigh fading channels, and the results show that SE consistently outperforms the dedicated embedding (DE) scheme, which assigns each user an exclusive portion of the embedding space, across different channel conditions and user densities. The empirical SE curves match the theoretical predictions with fitted alignment factors and approach the NOMA-inspired bound as the embedding dimension increases, thereby showing that the embedding space can function as a new axis of multiple access complementary to time, frequency, and code domains. Finally, we outline adaptive and generalized training strategies that extend beyond symbol-level recovery to semantic-level classification and reconstruction tasks for next generation networks."

In the proposed framework, the WGAN generator is enhanced with a dynamic gate function to ensure that the generated scenarios comply with practical physical constraints of PV outputs. Furthermore, the WGAN discriminator incorporates the ring law from random matrix theory, thereby enhancing both the interpretability of the generative model and the quality of the generated scenarios.

In contrast, deep learning (DL) methods offer powerful data-driven solutions yet often act as closed boxes, ignoring physical constraints and overfitting to spurious patterns. Hybrid DL (HDL) approaches bridge this gap by integrating physical models with neural architectures, combining interpretability and data adaptivity. This article surveys the emerging landscape of HDL methods in RS image processing, outlining their theoretical foundations, motivations, and design philosophies.

However, when adding new objects—such as a car—to a scene, their style often cannot be inferred solely from the surrounding context. On the other hand, the models that can output diverse generations struggle to output images that have seamless boundaries between the generated and unerased parts. In this work, we propose a framework that can encode visible and partially visible objects with a novel mechanism to achieve consistency in the style encoding and final generations. We extensively compare with previous conditional image generation and semantic image editing algorithms. Our extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves over the state-of-the-art. Our method not only achieves better quantitative results but also provides diverse results.

    "abstract": "DC microgrids (DCMGs) have attracted increasing attention owing to their high efficiency and compatibility with renewable energy sources. However, maintaining system stability under distributed control remains challenging, as the coupling between controller and converter dynamics leads to a high-order system, particularly when numerous converters are involved. For such high-order systems, singular perturbation theory can decouple the dynamics into fast and slow subsystems, allowing the overall stability to be inferred when the fast subsystem responds sufficiently faster than the slow one. Nevertheless, existing studies have not quantified how much faster the converter dynamics must be relative to the controller dynamics to ensure overall stability, which may lead to the failure of stabilization control. Moreover, when system parameters are uncertain—such as under varying load conditions—traditional stability analysis methods face difficulties in deriving explicit analytical criteria. To address these issues, this paper presents a comprehensive stability analysis of DC microgrids based on singular perturbation theory and the small-gain theorem. First, singular perturbation theory is employed to decompose the high-order DCMG into a boundary-layer subsystem and a reduced-order subsystem, and explicit analytical stability conditions are derived for each. Second, based on the small-gain theorem, it is rigorously proven that when both subsystems are stable, smaller filter capacitances, inductances, and controller gain coefficients enhance the system’s stability—and a quantitative analytical criterion is further derived to quantify this relationship. Third, under uncertain load conditions, the singular value inequality is utilized to derive analytical conditions for robust stability. Simulation results show that the relative error between the stability bound derived by the proposed conditions and the actual stability bound is about 15.4% for constant loads, and approximately 44.4% for uncertain loads—verifying the proposed method’s low-conservatism advantage under constant loads and effective robustness under uncertain loads."

    "abstract": "There are currently four key limitations in most existing privacy-aware driving route navigation methods: 1) lack of an offloading framework for massive driving route data, 2) potential privacy leakage even with virtual trajectories, 3) reliance on recommending the fastest route rather than the most suitable one, 4) lack of comprehensive consideration of multi-dimensional information, leading to inadequate navigation accuracy. The limitations restrict the further application of the navigation. To address these limitations, we propose a Tensor-based Privacy-aware driving route Navigation scheme based on Cloud-fog-edge calculative User-vehicle-road Preferences (named TPNCUP). First, TPNCUP includes an offloading framework based on cloud-fog-edge collaborative computing. Second, TPNCUP provides a route obfuscation method to enhance privacy level. Third, TPNCUP recommends routes based on user-vehicle-road preferences instead of simply selecting the fastest one. Finally, TPNCUP constructs a set of 3rd-order tensors to comprehensively consider multi-dimensional information for increasing navigation accuracy. From a philosophical perspective, the use of TPNCUP reconstructs the subject-object relationship, corrects technical determinism, and assumes ethical responsibility in intelligent navigation. Extensive experimental results show that our scheme significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art methods in the privacy level, navigation accuracy and computational overhead. Specifically, our scheme reduces the risk of privacy leakage by 70.53%, improves navigation accuracy by 8.01%, and decreases computational overhead by 77.3%."

Our policy is trained in a photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) simulator via Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DiffRL), enabling efficient learning of low-level control from visual and linguistic inputs. At its core is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) action head, which adaptively routes computation to improve generalization while mitigating forgetting. In multi-task generalization experiments, our method achieves a success rate of 83% on trained tasks and 75% on unseen tasks in simulation. When deployed on real hardware, it attains 67% success on trained tasks and 50% on unseen ones. In multi-environment adaptation experiments, our method achieves an average success rate of 81% across diverse simulated environments and 67% across varied real-world settings.

While some previous studies have used OCT for estimating the pose of rigid instruments, those methods are specific to needle-like tools, and often have slow processing speed. In this work, we benchmark eight deep-learning models adapted from other 3D modalities to OCT data showing magnetic tools in a mock surgical environment. The models are tested in the presence of other objects, occlusion, noise, and the tool being partially outside of the OCT's field of view. The best performing model, VoxelNeXt, is adapted from 3D object detection in LiDAR scans, the first time a model of this kind is used on medical data. It infers tool pose with 0.6 mm position and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$5^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> angular errors, with 40 ms inference time. We use this model to provide feedback for controlling a multi-jointed magnetic tool, demonstrating the robustness of OCT-based feedback control.

    "abstract": "Interactive Segmentation (IS) segments specific objects or parts by deducing human intent from sparse input prompts. However, the sparse-to-dense mapping is ambiguous, making it challenging for users to obtain segmentations at the desired granularity and causing them to engage in trial-and-error cycles. Although existing multi-granularity IS models (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>, SAM) alleviate the ambiguity of single-granularity methods by predicting multiple masks simultaneously, this approach has limited scalability and produces redundant results. To address this issue, we introduce a creative granularity-controllable IS paradigm that resolves ambiguity by enabling users to precisely control the segmentation granularity. Specifically, we propose a Unified Granularity Controller (UniGraCo) that supports multi-type optional granularity control signals to pursue unified control over diverse segmentation requirements, effectively overcoming the limitation of single-type control in adapting to different needs, thus boosting the system efficiency and practicality. To mitigate the excessive cost of annotating the multi-granularity masks and the corresponding granularity control signals for training UniGraCo, we construct an automated data engine capable of generating high-quality and granularity-abundant mask-granularity data pairs at low cost. To enable UniGraCo to learn unified granularity controllability in an efficient and stable manner, we further design a granularity-controllable learning strategy. This strategy leverages the generated data pairs to incrementally equip the pre-trained IS model with granularity controllability while preserving its segmentation capability. Extensive experiments on intricate scenarios at both instance and part level demonstrate that our UniGraCo has significant advantages over previous methods, highlighting its potential as a practical interactive tool.

    "abstract": "In this article, the exponential consensus of a multiagent system with a sampled-data controller is investigated. The exponential stability and stabilization conditions are established using a two-sided looped Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. The existing methods exhibit high conservatism, and the linear matrix inequality computations involve high dimensions. To address these issues, the proposed method effectively extends the allowable sampling interval and reduces the computational complexity. To simplify the analysis, a novel order-reduction technique is introduced, which reformulates the Kronecker product-based quadratic form into a state-difference representation. Furthermore, an improved inequality is derived by incorporating Bernoulli inequality, explicitly considering the parameters of exponential convergence and the sampling interval. This refinement results in a less conservative stability condition, allowing for a wider range of sampling intervals without compromising system performance. In addition, a more flexible adjustable range is achieved by introducing free-weighting matrices in a zero-equation representation of the system and leveraging an inequality formulated based on the Laplacian matrix. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, highlighting its effectiveness in extending the sampled interval and improving system performance compared to conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "Generating continuous models from sparse measurements remains a key challenge in remote sensing due to the limited availability and high cost of dense data collection. Traditional interpolation methods such as ordinary Kriging and natural neighbor interpolation often degrade significantly in accuracy under sparse measurements. To address this, we introduce T-GMSI, a Transformer-based Generative Model for Spatial Interpolation approach, which leverages the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for high-quality spatial interpolation from sparse inputs. We then apply T-GMSI to the task of digital elevation model (DEM) generation using sparse spaceborne laser altimetry data. Results show that T-GMSI maintains high accuracy even with over 70% data sparsity and generalizes well across diverse landscapes without requiring fine-tuning. Compared to baseline methods, T-GMSI reduces root mean square error (RMSE) by 40% and 25% over ordinary Kriging and natural neighbor interpolation, respectively, on airborne lidar datasets, and by 23% and 10% on spaceborne laser altimeter data. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art conditional generative adversarial network (CEDGAN), improving RMSE by 35% and 20% for airborne and spaceborne data, respectively. The study highlights the potential of learning-based interpolation methods for improving Earth observation modeling with sparse and incomplete remote sensing data."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image classification is a critical task in remote sensing, where recent transformer-based methods have shown promising improvements in spatial-spectral feature ex-traction. However, most existing transformer-based hyperspectral image classification methods rely on absolute or bias-based posi-tional embeddings that fail to preserve geometric relationships; limiting their ability to capture precise diagonal and multi-directional spatial–spectral interactions between hyperspectral pixels and resulting in degraded classification accuracy. Although Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and its variants have been studied in computer vision with standard RGB image input, their use in hyperspectral imaging (HSI), especially for pixel-level clas-sification, remains underexplored. We propose HyperRoPE-SST, a transformer-based architecture based on a patch-local mixed-axis 2D RoPE with learnable frequencies that preserves geometric relationships amongst the pixels within a hyperspectral patch while adapting to dataset-specific spatial–spectral characteristics. The HyperRoPE-SST pipeline employs principal component analysis (PCA) for spectral dimensionality reduction followed by the extraction of target-centered local patches and embedding of these patches with shallow convolutions. A 2D RoPE-enhanced transformer encoder subsequently fuses the spatial and spectral information via center-focused attention to produce context-aware target pixel embeddings, yielding superior classification performance. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, i.e., Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University (PU), Houston 2013 (HU), Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and Salinas (SAL), demonstrate that HyperRoPE-SST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN)- and transformer-based models, achieving overall accuracies of 96.81%, 95.65%, 93.38%, 99.62%, and 95.59% respectively, on the aforementioned datasets.

    "abstract": "Traditional nursing practices often rely on empirical judgments, lacking real-time predictive capabilities and adaptive intervention mechanisms. This results in suboptimal responses to intradialytic complications such as hypotension, cramps, or fluid imbalance, thereby affecting patient safety and treatment efficacy. We introduce an integrated approach combining a Dynamic Hemodynamic Regulation Network (DHR-Net) and an Adaptive Clinical Intervention Strategy (ACIS), leveraging computational intelligence and predictive analytics. DHR-Net is a hybrid architecture that combines physiological dynamics modeling with deep learning to forecast patient state transitions, plasma refilling rates, and adverse event probabilities in real-time. Leveraging these predictions, ACIS dynamically optimizes nursing interventions, as ultrafiltration adjustments and dialysate temperature modulation, under a closed-loop control system. The proposed system mathematically formalizes the hemodialysis nursing process, enabling precise fluid management, risk mitigation, and enhanced patient-specific treatment strategies. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in patient hemodynamic stability, a reduction in adverse event occurrences, and enhanced operational efficiency compared to conventional nursing protocols. This research contributes to the broader goal of computational healthcare by embedding intelligent decision-support mechanisms within clinical workflows, thereby advancing the field of intelligent nursing systems."

    "abstract": "Magnetically actuated soft continuum robots (MSCRs), which offer remote and wireless control via external magnetic fields along with high flexibility, have recently emerged as a promising technology for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). However, the magnetic actuation forces of MSCRs are generally limited, resulting in inherent workspace constraints. To overcome these limitations, various design strategies have been explored, including the development of an asymmetric magnetized soft continuum robot (AMSCR). Although AMSCRs have demonstrated a significantly larger workspace than conventional MSCRs, a quantitative relationship between the magnetization patterns of embedded magnetic particles and the resulting workspace has not yet been fully clarified. In this study, an energy based kinematic analysis of AMSCR was conducted to address this issue. Specifically, the equilibrium posture of the AMSCR was determined by minimizing the total potential energy, considering different combinations of external magnetic field directions and internal magnetization patterns. Based on the resulting potential energy graph, the workspace of the AMSCR was quantitatively analyzed, and an optimal linear asymmetric magnetization pattern was identified. Furthermore, the proposed energy-based kinematic model was validated through finite element analysis (FEA) conducted using COMSOL Multi-physics, as well as through experiments performed on a fabricated AMSCR prototype. As a result, an optimal magnetization design method for linearly asymmetric AMSCRs was proposed and experimentally confirmed. The proposed approach is expected to be further applicable to the kinematic performance evaluation and design optimization of AMSCRs with various other magnetization patterns."

Distractors in the RDW techniques often require special training or instruction that can break immersion and cause boredom when done repeatedly without variation. While previous research was more likely to explore distractors with rotation gain. This study aims to design it in a particular context and investigate the use of distractors, focusing on translation gain to study user awareness of changes in the virtual environment."

Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a task-specific layer. Encoders corresponding to the same modality are shared among clients, while the intrinsic correlation among their task-specific layers is captured by using the sheaf structure. Numerical experiments in a mmWave beamforming prediction scenario show that the proposed algorithm surpasses baseline methods, delivering improved convergence rates and test accuracy."

Three detection methods are introduced to address the exponential complexity of Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection in MIMO-AFDM-IM. These methods aim to strike a balance between detection accuracy and computational complexity. Additionally, the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the MIMO-AFDM-IM scheme is derived to assess its performance. Computer simulations are carried out under time-varying multipath conditions, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MIMO-AFDM-IM over MIMOAFDM and AFDM-IM across various system configurations."

In August 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology officially standardized ML-DSA under FIPS 204. ML-DSA generates one valid signature and multiple rejected signatures during a single signing process. Most side-channel attacks targeting ML-DSA have focused solely on the valid signature, while largely neglecting the hints contained in rejected signatures. Building on prior SASCA frameworks originally proposed for ML-DSA, in this paper we present an efficient and fully practical instantiation of a private-key recovery attack on ML-DSA that jointly exploits side-channel leakages from both valid and rejected signatures within a unified factor graph. This concrete instantiation maximizes the information extracted from a single signing attempt and minimizes the number of required traces for full key recovery. We conducted a proof-of-concept experiment with both reference and ASM-optimized implementations on a Cortex-M4 core chip, where the results demonstrate that incorporating rejected signatures reduces the required number of traces by at least 50.0% for full key recovery. Moreover, we show that using only rejected signatures suffices to recover the key with fewer than 30 traces under our setup. Our findings highlight that protecting rejected signatures is crucial, as their leakage provides valuable side-channel information. We strongly recommend implementing countermeasures for rejected signatures during the signing process to mitigate potential threats."

    "abstract": "This study aims at the shock problem during the process of switching from the series mode to the parallel mode of the multi-mode clutch transmission and proposes a two-stage speed control strategy to achieve smooth and efficient mode switching. The multi-mode clutch transmission is an innovative power transmission system. Through the flexible coupling design of the inner and outer rings and the coordinated control of multiple motors, it achieves efficient energy management and smooth power output among the engine, motor and wheels. The core lies in the independent operation or collaborative working ability of the inner circle and the outer circle, supporting multiple operation modes. During the switching process, the inner ring needs to quickly approach the rotational speed of the outer ring to achieve torque transmission, but direct engagement may cause mechanical shock. To this end, this study proposes a staged control method: In the first stage, a rapid rotational speed mode is adopted to make the inner ring approach the rotational speed of the outer ring in a short period of time; When the speed difference approaches the set offset value, switch to the slow speed mode of the second stage and smoothly complete the engagement process. This strategy adjusts the rotational speed of the drive motor in real time through the rotational speed closed-loop technology, taking into account both rapidity and smoothness. Based on the MATLAB/Simulink environment, this study constructed a closed-loop simulation platform for the vehicle control system, simulated the power transmission characteristics of the multi-mode clutch under different working conditions, and evaluated the vehicle acceleration response. By comparing and testing the rapid engagement and two-stage engagement strategies, the results show that the optimized control strategy significantly improves the stability of the vehicle and the user experience, providing effective support for the balance between power transmission efficiency and comfort."

    "abstract": "In an internal Electrical Safety audits context, it was found that a systematic approach to periodic and active implementation of these audits has a significant impact in the industrial sector. This is because they aim to identify and propose solutions for systemic and specific deviations in safety management, compliance, and, most importantly, in electrical installations. The research emphasizes the importance of regular and structured audits to identify and mitigate risks, implement a safety culture on platforms, and standardize the understanding and application of safety norms and guidelines. The methodology will present the systematic approach adopted in conducting internal audits, explaining the management framework used. The guidelines, application methods, verification, and critical analysis will be detailed. The understandings and consensus used, as well as the best practices adopted within Petrobras’ oil production platform system, will be explained. The impact of this systematic approach will be presented based on historical data analysis of internal audits, safety indicators, the gradual reduction in the number of deviations found, the evolution in addressing these deviations, and the improved adherence to Regulatory Standard 10 (NR-10) and other compliance items over time. Since the audits cover different platforms with distinct topologies and management systems, the results will provide a global overview of Petrobras Espírito Santo’s entire platform system while also highlighting specific noteworthy guidelines. It is expected that the presented results can serve as a reference for other companies seeking to enhance their electrical safety management systems."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the electric vehicle industry, electric vehicle battery (EVB) recycling is playing an increasingly essential role in resource sustainability and environmental protection. Network design is recognized as a critical factor impacting the operational efficiency of EVB recycling. However, existing research primarily focuses on facility location decisions, often neglecting the optimization of the recycling network's topology. In addition, the uncertainty inherent in EVB recycling demand is typically oversimplified, leading to considerable deviations from real-world conditions. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach to the EVB recycling network problem based on demand forecasting from a fourth-party logistics (4PL) perspective. The topological structure of the recycling network is optimized by integrating facility location and logistics provider selection decisions. By using the Transformer model to predict recycling demand, a mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed, which is solved based on the Sample Average Approximation algorithm. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model and approach are examined through a real-world case study in Jiangxi Province. Finally, analyses are conducted to assess the impact of unit penalty cost, the flowed waste ratio, and the maximum capacity of collection centers on the network's design and operational decisions, offering crucial managerial insights."

In this context, Distributed MIMO (DMIMO) technology, plays a crucial role in expanding Line-of-Sight (LoS) coverage and reducing signal obstructions. While extensive research has explored D-MIMO techniques, most studies rely on stochastic channel models that may not fully capture real-world propagation effects. In this paper, we analyze downlink multi-user multiplexing in an industrial D-MIMO network, comparing deployment strategies based on spectral and energy efficiency metrics, leveraging detailed ray-tracing modeling. Our results highlight key trade-offs for network deployment. We emphasize the need for a well-balanced densification strategy to optimize the trade-off between throughput and energy consumption. Although our model provides upper-bound performance estimates due to certain simplifications, it offers valuable insights for real-world deployments."

In this paper, we consider the application of the massive relay MIMO system in urban environments.

    "abstract": "The IMT-2030 vision emphasizes two key 6G directions: integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) alongside artificial intelligence (AI)-native frameworks, where multimodal sensory data inputs enhance situational awareness and adaptive decision-making of communication systems. Accordingly, this paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based beam selection framework for downlink multi-user reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO (mMIMO) systems. Targeting maximized sum rates under quality of service (QoS) and fairness constraints, the framework employs two primary sensing modalities: a stereo camera mounted on the RIS for user equipment (UE) detection and inertial measurement units (IMUs) on UEs to obtain 3D Cartesian coordinates, thus eliminating the need for channel state information (CSI) acquisition. The DRL framework combines two algorithms—double deep Q-network (DDQN) and proximal policy optimization (PPO)—to jointly optimize RIS phase shifts and UE receive beamformers through predefined codebooks and adaptive beam selection. A testbed was developed to validate the system, leveraging real-world data to train the DRL algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that both agents achieve nearoptimal sum rates across diverse base station (BS) transmit power levels and QoS thresholds while reducing computational complexity by 95%, illustrating the framework’s potential for efficient and scalable beam alignment for AI-native wireless systems."

Accurate prediction of various acidic gases produced in this process is beneficial for supporting optimization control research. A prediction model for acidic gases based on random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks is proposed. Firstly, the RF algorithm is used to select feature variables with strong correlation to the target variables, to obtain a shared feature selection for multiple acidic gases. Then, these selected features are used as the input of a multi-output LSTM model to predict the target variables and obtain multi-output evaluation indicators. Finally, based on the above indicators and the threshold range of acidic gases, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Experiments show that the RF-LSTM model has high prediction accuracy."

As a result, we showed that task vectors are effective in those Japanese to English / English to Japanese translation tasks performed by Japanese and non-Japanese LLMs. Non-Japanese LLMs achieve high accuracy on Japanese-to-English translation, comparable to European language tasks. However, their performance significantly degrades when tasked with English-to-Japanese translation. In contrast, Japanesespecialized LLMs maintain high and stable accuracy in both directions.

In our approach, we modify the phase mapping of Huffman BMOCZ by shrinking the angle between adjacent zeros, except for the first and last, to introduce a gap in the zero constellation. By discerning the gap location in the received polynomial, the receiver can estimate and correct the phase rotation. We demonstrate the error rate performance of SBMOCZ relative to Huffman BMOCZ, showing that SBMOCZ addresses a CFO-induced rotation at the cost of a modest performance reduction compared to Huffman BMOCZ in the absence of a CFO. Finally, we compare SBMOCZ to Huffman BMOCZ using a cyclically permutable code (CPC), showing a 4 dB bit error rate (BER) improvement in a fading channel, while demonstrating comparable performance across other simulations."

Although MoS is typically calculated using motion capture systems, this study aims to predict the minimum mediolateral MoS using only center of mass (CoM) velocity data. Time-series data of tri-axial CoM velocities during single steps were analyzed using Principal Motion Analysis, a stochastic learning method for multivariate time-series data. To account for variability in gait patterns, unsupervised clustering was applied, and separate predictive models were developed for each cluster. The results demonstrated that stratified learning significantly improved prediction accuracy compared to a single-model approach, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) from 21.6 mm to 18.5 mm. These findings indicate that incorporating gait stratification into predictive modeling can enhance the accuracy of MoS estimation based solely on kinematic data."

    "abstract": "5G-NR in FR2 relies on beamforming and accurate beam alignment between the gNodeB (gNB) and the user equipment (UE) to address challenging channel conditions. Maintaining beam alignment for a mobile UE requires frequent updates via beam-sweeping and directional radio frequency measurements, entailing high delay and signaling overhead. Location-aided beam management has emerged as a promising solution for reducing this overhead by combining UE location with historical directional beam training information to construct radio environment maps (REMs) for effective beam alignment. However, the highly site-specific nature of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) propagation makes REM-based beam management vulnerable to performance degradation due to errors in UE location information, e.g., obtained via global navigation satellite system (GNSS), affecting the accuracy of both REM construction and querying. This paper proposes a 5G-NR standard-compliant solution to mitigate GNSS location error in REM-based beam management, by constructing our rank-REM from multiple UE directional channel measurements and multi-beam monitoring for connected UEs. Our results, based on ray-tracing in an urban environment, show that our proposed REM construction and querying strategy effectively mitigates realistic GNSS location error, substantially enhancing link stability for a mobile UE by reducing radio link failures (RLFs) and handovers, thus enabling effective REM-based beam management for 5G-and-beyond."

    "abstract": "Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (PMUTs) are widely used in sensing applications, where high-order modes of PMUT can be used to enhance sensing accuracy. However, in existing works, when PMUTs work at a high-order resonance mode, their weak amplitude of flexural vibration and sound pressure cancellation from opposite membrane motions result in low sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate a novel PMUT with double-turn slots at the edge of the membrane, transforming the fully-clamped membrane into a suspended structure, thus modifying the mode shape. When the PMUT operates in the second-order mode, the structure alleviates sound pressure cancellation, and enables large vibration amplitude, thus enhancing both sensitivity and frequency. AlN-based PMUT prototypes are fabricated on a 4-inch wafer with CMOS compatible processes for validation. Compared to fully-clamped PMUTs operating in the fundamental resonance mode, the central displacements of the two devices with different slot angles are increased by 153% and 84%, their frequencies are improved by 59% and 189%, respectively, and the round-trip sensitivity is enhanced by 5.47 dB. As demonstration examples, pulse-echo-based ranging and imaging are explored using a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$3\\times 5$</tex-math> </inline-formula> PMUT array. The ranging accuracy is 0.65 mm with a maximum distance of 50 mm, and the imaging deviation is 0.6 mm at a distance of 2 cm. These results demonstrate great application potential of this innovative design."

    "abstract": "Conventional approaches to visualizing dynamic human facial expressions—-such as flat-panel displays or static mannequins–fall short in delivering immersive, responsive experiences, especially in applications like medical simulation and virtual interaction. We present a novel visualization framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to drive photorealistic, real-time facial avatars across both stereoscopic 3D displays and virtual reality (VR) environments. Our system renders view-dependent expressions with volumetric continuity, enabling avatars to convey nuanced non-verbal feedback such as pain or discomfort in real time. The framework integrates FLAME-based expression modeling, Gaussian-based neural rendering, and multi-view calibration for seamless projection to holographic displays and immersive headsets. By bridging the gap between facial expression generation and high-fidelity 3D visualization, our approach sets the foundation for next-generation training systems, social VR, and embodied human-computer interaction."

Our results demonstrate successful docking of nilotinib with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\alpha$</tex>-synuclein, with the optimal interaction exhibiting a binding energy of -5.00 kcal/mol and ligand efficiency of -0.17 kcal/mol/atom. This investigation aims to evaluate the potential for significantly mitigating phosphorylation effects in Parkinson's disease, thereby providing a robust foundation for future therapeutic development."

    "abstract": "The number of information security threats transmitted via email, such as phishing and spear phishing, has been rapidly increasing. To mitigate these threats, it is essential to cultivate individuals capable of independently recognizing phishing emails. Although information security education programs are being implemented, their effectiveness remains limited, particularly for those most vulnerable to targeted attacks. In this study, we conducted a web-based spear phishing simulation and a questionnaire targeting university students to investigate user characteristics associated with vulnerability and to explore the feasibility of building predictive models to identify vulnerable individuals. The results reveal that vulnerable individuals tend to perceive themselves as good communicators, have low self-assessments of their security practices, and exhibit traits associated with carelessness. Furthermore, predictive models based on Support Vector Machines and decision trees proved effective for identifying these individuals, achieving F1-scores of 0.72 and 0.80 respectively through stratified k-fold cross-validation."

    "abstract": "This study investigates how different music-visual integration interfaces influence users’ sense of self-relevance when viewing Instagram Stories. As Instagram expands music features across Stories, posts, and notes, music serves as a symbolic medium—emotionally expressive yet open-ended— offering a nuanced alternative to text in public self-expression. Common interface types include static images with album covers, animated lyrics, dynamic videos, and externally shared music posts. In a simulated browsing setting, 31 participants aged 20–30 engaged with four interface types, completed a self-relevance scale after each, and participated in brief interviews. Results showed significant differences in self-association across interfaces, highlighting how design shapes psychological engagement and offering empirical insights for optimizing audio-visual content."

    "abstract": "Under the current background of the electrification transformation and development of the shipping industry, shipowners have doubts about the expected returns of the electrification retrofit of old ships. This paper proposes a cost-benefit estimation methodology for the retrofit of old ships. According to the power grid topology in different retrofit schemes, the ship energy management strategy model is constructed to estimate the ship's operating costs during voyage tasks and analyze the investment payback period required by the retrofit schemes. Under the assumption of 120 voyages per year, Config III can recover the refitting cost in as short as 3.2 years and obtain an additional 428% of revenue during the remaining service life of the ship."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "In recent years, with the widespread use of IoT (Internet of Things) devices, security issues in hardware devices have become critical. In particular, IoT devices that run applications on the OS have complex power consumption waveform due to the overlap of steady-state power consumption by the OS and hardware and power consumption by the applications. Conventional anomalous behavior detection methods using power consumption need to remove the steady-state power consumption from the measured power consumption, but if the steady-state power consumption is complex, it may not obtain correct anomalous behavior detection results. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting anomalous behaviors of IoT devices using time-series embedded representations. The proposed method converts measured power consumption waveform into embedded representation sequence using autoencoder. Then, it detects anomalous behaviors based on the prediction-errors of the embedded representations. We applied the proposed method to an IoT device implemented using a Raspberry Pi4, and successfully detected anomalous behaviors while the recent state-of-the-art method cannot detect them."

    "abstract": "Utilization of the Delay-Doppler (DD) domain enables the recently proposed two-dimensional (2D) Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) waveform to provide consistent performance under high mobility communication systems. OTFS outperforms existing standard waveforms under such time-frequency selective channels, making it a waveform candidate for future wireless communication systems. In this work, we present an implementation of an OTFS waveform-based system on a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) X310 Software Defined Radio (SDR). This system is tested in a realistic indoor office environment at a 5 GHz carrier frequency band with 150 MHz bandwidth. The resulting constellation diagrams were observed for BPSK, 4-QAM, and 16-QAM modulated OTFS symbols. Furthermore, for 4-QAM symbols, several communication metrics, such as Bit Error Rate (BER) and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), were evaluated against different gains at the USRP. The resulting constellation diagrams, BER, and EVM graphs show a successful implementation of our OTFS system."

    "abstract": "The roughness of surfaces spans over many scales, and asperities can be the size of nanometers up to millimeters. This work employs previously measured ‘nearly complete’ surface spectrums to model surface contact. These spectrums include data from sub-nanoscale tunneling electron microscopy cross-sections of surfaces. To account for these small scales, the rough surface contact mechanics models consider scale dependent material properties such as yield strength and electrical conductivity. The ranges of included scales of surface features are then varied to evaluate their theoretical influence on electrical contact resistance. This provides insight into the importance of atomic scale roughness in electrical contact and different contact pressures."

In this study, we proposed a system for delivering olfactory stimuli to users using a drone. We implemented a workflow where the drone autonomously moves away when the user approaches the olfactory spot in the different scenarios. Experimental results showed that closer retreat distances increased users’ awareness of airflow, suggesting that physical sensations influence overall experience."
