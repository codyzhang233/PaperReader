    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations are widely used to communicate how inputs must change for a model to alter its prediction. For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations. We argue that safeguards should therefore prioritise reproducibility, standardisation, and procedural constraints over post-hoc detection, and we provide recommendations for algorithm developers, explanation providers, and auditors."

    "abstract": "Hrushovski observed that the new gap principle of Gao-Ge-Kühne is essentially equivalent to the Bogomolov conjecture over arbitrary globally valued fields of characteristic $0$. Building on this observation, we prove a new gap principle for semiabelian varieties by reducing the Bogomolov conjecture for semiabelian varieties to the Bogomolov conjecture for abelian varieties over arbitrary GVFs. This reduction remains valid in positive characteristic; however, the corresponding Bogomolov conjecture for abelian varieties is not yet known in that setting. We prove an unconditional new gap principle in positive characteristic for semiabelian varieties whose abelian quotient is an elliptic curve."

IEAT incorporates user emotional states and their underlying causes into the model's internal reasoning process, enabling emotion-aware reasoning to be internalized rather than treated as explicit supervision. The model is trained with a two-stage progressive strategy. The first stage performs speech-text alignment and emotional attribute modeling via self-distillation, while the second stage conducts end-to-end cross-modal joint optimization to ensure consistency between textual and spoken emotional expressions. Experiments on the Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) Emotional Intelligence benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves top-ranked performance across emotional trajectory modeling, emotional reasoning, and empathetic response generation under both LLM-based and human evaluations."

    "abstract": "Crop mapping based on satellite images time-series (SITS) holds substantial economic value in agricultural production settings, in which parcel segmentation is an essential step. Existing approaches have achieved notable advancements in SITS segmentation with predetermined sequence lengths. However, we found that these approaches overlooked the generalization capability of models across scenarios with varying temporal length, leading to markedly poor segmentation results in such cases. To address this issue, we propose TEA, a TEmporal Adaptive SITS semantic segmentation method to enhance the model's resilience under varying sequence lengths. We introduce a teacher model that encapsulates the global sequence knowledge to guide a student model with adaptive temporal input lengths. Specifically, teacher shapes the student's feature space via intermediate embedding, prototypes and soft label perspectives to realize knowledge transfer, while dynamically aggregating student model to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Finally, we introduce full-sequence reconstruction as an auxiliary task to further enhance the quality of representations across inputs of varying temporal lengths. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method brings remarkable improvements across inputs of different temporal lengths on common benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available."

    "abstract": "I suggest that some of the mysterious temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) may be explained if they are produced by dynamically triaxial magnetars. If the bursts are narrowly collimated along open field lines, then observed repeating FRB may be those in which the moment of inertia tensor is only slightly triaxial and the rotation axis, open field lines and radiation point nearly to the observer. Apparently non-repeating FRB may be triaxial with the direction of open field lines and radiation wandering across the sky, reducing their duty factors by several orders of magnitude. A slightly triaxial moment tensor in repeaters moves the line of sight into or out of the radiation pattern or within it, explaining periods of greater or lesser (or absent) activity, and making the probability of detecting a burst vary aperiodically. The dynamics of triaxial bodies may also thwart the coherent integration of gravitational signals from fast-rotating accreting neutron stars."

    "abstract": "Automatic metrics are now central to evaluating text-to-image models, often substituting for human judgment in benchmarking and large-scale filtering. However, it remains unclear whether these metrics truly prioritize semantic correctness or instead favor visually and socially prototypical images learned from biased data distributions. We identify and study \\emph{prototypicality bias} as a systematic failure mode in multimodal evaluation. We introduce a controlled contrastive benchmark \\textsc{\\textbf{ProtoBias}} (\\textit{\\textbf{Proto}typical \\textbf{Bias}}), spanning Animals, Objects, and Demography images, where semantically correct but non-prototypical images are paired with subtly incorrect yet prototypical adversarial counterparts. This setup enables a directional evaluation of whether metrics follow textual semantics or default to prototypes. Our results show that widely used metrics, including CLIPScore, PickScore, and VQA-based scores, frequently misrank these pairs, while even LLM-as-Judge systems exhibit uneven robustness in socially grounded cases. Human evaluations consistently favour semantic correctness with larger decision margins. Motivated by these findings, we propose \\textbf{\\textsc{ProtoScore}}, a robust 7B-parameter metric that substantially reduces failure rates and suppresses misranking, while running at orders of magnitude faster than the inference time of GPT-5, approaching the robustness of much larger closed-source judges."

In this way, borospherenes, a 2D Boron-based fullerene-like lattice (2D-B40), are explored due to their potential for capturing and detecting toxic gases, such as CO, NO, NH3, and SO2. Therefore, density functional theory simulations were carried out to explore the adsorption energy and the distinct interaction regimes, where CO exhibits weak physisorption (-0.16 eV), while NO (-2.24 eV), NH3 (-1.47 eV), and SO2 (-1.51 eV) undergo strong chemisorption. Bader charge analysis reveals significant electron donation from 2D-B40 to NO and electron acceptance from SO2. These interactions cause measurable shifts in work function, with SO2 producing the most significant modulation (14.6%). Remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) reveal spontaneous SO2 decomposition at room temperature, indicating dual functionality for both sensing and environmental remediation. Compared to other boron-based materials, such as chi3-borophene, beta12-borophene, and B40 fullerene, 2D-B40 exhibits superior gas affinity, positioning it as a versatile platform for the detection and capture of toxic gases."

This tail often exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and we show that the singularity is captured by a time-dependent WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation applied directly to the master equation. This approximation, however, leaves undetermined a large pre-exponential factor. Here we show how to calculate this factor by applying a leading- and a subleading-order WKB approximation to the Laplace-transformed backward master equation. Accurate asymptotic results can be obtained when this WKB solution can be matched to another approximate solution (the ``inner\" solution), valid for not too large $m$. We demonstrate and verify this method on three examples of reactions which are also solvable without approximations."

    "abstract": "Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) represent one of the promising new accelerator concepts that are now being developed intensively for future applications in high-energy physics and industry. Among the unresolved problems of practical implementation of PWFA there are maintaining the required quality (emittance, size, energy spread of bunches) and stable transportation of drive and accelerated (witness) bunches over long acceleration distances. For improving the bunch transport, we propose to fill the bunch transport channel with the background plasma, the density of which is lower than the main plasma density building up an accelerating wake wave. We call this waveguide structure a layered plasma waveguide (LPW). The wakefield excitation by a regular sequence of electron bunches in the LPW of cylindrical configuration has been explored both analytically and numerically. The layered plasma has been modeled as a combination of a tubular plasma and a plasma column of significantly different densities. The plasma column has a lower density. The dispersion dependencies of the TM-modes of the LPW was obtained and analyzed, and it was found that there was a single TM wave resonant with the electron bunch. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the structures of the axial and radial wakefield amplitudes have been numerically investigated for the cases of a single drive bunch and a regular train of bunches. It is shown that for certain density ratios of the outer and inner plasmas, it is possible both to accelerate and focus simultaneously the drive and witness bunches. The 2.5D particle-in-cell code was used to simulate the witness acceleration of an electron bunch by a wakefield created by drive electron bunches in a two-layer plasma wakefield accelerator. The simulation showed good agreement with the results of analytical calculations."

As our main result we prove ubiquitous undecidability in all the variants, both for strategy and controller synthesis, already for winning conditions specified by one-clock automata. This strengthens and generalises previously known undecidability results. We also fully characterise those cases where finite memory is sufficient to win, namely existence of a strategy implies existence of a controller. All our results are stated in the timed setting, while analogous results hold in the data setting where one-clock automata are replaced by one-register ones."

It applies to differential equations of arbitrary order, with no genericity assumption, and is suited to high-precision computations. In addition, we present an open-source implementation of this algorithm in the SageMath computer algebra system and illustrate its use with several examples. Our implementation supports arbitrary-precision computations and automatically provides rigorous error bounds. The article assumes minimal prior knowledge of the asymptotic theory of meromorphic differential equations and provides an elementary introduction to the linear Stokes phenomenon that may be of independent interest."

This paper advances the traditional job shop scheduling problem by incorporating additional complexities through the simultaneous integration of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and tool-sharing systems. We propose a novel approach that combines Colored-Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs) with actor-critic model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), effectively addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with FMS. CTPNs provide a formal modeling structure and dynamic action masking, significantly reducing the action search space, while MBRL ensures adaptability to changing environments through the learned policy. Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time. To ensure reproducibility, we propose a gym-compatible environment and an instance generator. Additionally, an ablation study evaluates the contribution of each framework component to its overall performance."

We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models. Experimental results show that OI-MAS consistently outperforms baseline multi-agent systems, improving accuracy by up to 12.88\\% while reducing cost by up to 79.78\\%."

Our method operates via a fast GUI-based workflow where 2D SAM masks, generated from user point prompts, are refined using NeRF-derived depth priors to improve geometric accuracy and foreground-background separation. The core of our contribution is a custom CUDA kernel that aggregates these refined multi-view masks into a unified 3D voxel grid in under 200ms, enabling real-time visual feedback. This optimization-free design eliminates the need for per-scene training. Experiments on Mip-NeRF 360° and LLFF show that DivAS achieves segmentation quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while being 2-2.5x faster end-to-end, and up to an order of magnitude faster when excluding user prompting time."

Although a perfectly flat band cannot exist in a continuous system, a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in a Zeeman lattice can realize the quasi-flat lowest band with an extremely narrow bandwidth. In such a quasi flat band, half vortex solitons become confined within a single lattice cell, enabling the formation of arrays of coupled half vortex solitons arranged of various spatial geometries. In this work, we study the existence and stability of these lattices within the framework of the two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that, near the quasi-flat band, half-vortex solitons and their arrays can be excited with a nearly negligible number of atoms and are constrained by their local symmetries, which are isomorphic to a dihedral group of order 8. This allows observation of the respective field patterns in the nearly linear regime where they exhibit enhanced stability. The constructed lattices may have diverse geometric profiles, and in particular create a composite super-half-vortex soliton with nonlinear symmetry breaking."

Centralised archi-tectures, though widely used, pose privacy and scalabil-ity challenges due to the aggregation of sensitive biomet-ric data. Decentralised identity frameworks offer better data sovereignty and eliminate single points of failure but introduce new security concerns, particularly around mu-tual trust among distributed devices. In such environments, biometric sensors and verification agents must authenticate one another before sharing sensitive biometric data. Ex-isting authentication schemes rely on classical public key infrastructure, which is increasingly susceptible to quan-tum attacks. This work addresses this gap by propos-ing a quantum-secure communication protocol for decen-tralised biometric systems, built upon an enhanced Quan-tum Key Distribution (QKD) system. The protocol incorpo-rates quantum-resilient authentication at both the classical and quantum layers of QKD: post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is used to secure the classical channel, while authen-tication qubits verify the integrity of the quantum channel. Once trust is established, QKD generates symmetric keys for encrypting biometric data in transit. Qiskit-based sim-ulations show a key generation rate of 15 bits/sec and 89% efficiency. This layered, quantum-resilient approach offers scalable, robust authentication for next-generation smart city infrastructures."

The ferroelectric and paraelectric phases are close in energy and can be reversibly switched by moderate strain or an electric field. During the transition, a kagome-like flat band emerges near the Fermi level, which we describe via a minimal three-orbital tight-binding model on a triangular lattice. Furthermore, the system exhibits sizable magnetic anisotropy and a magnetization-dependent Chern insulating state: the Chern number is $C = \\pm 1$ for out-of-plane magnetization but becomes trivial when the moments rotate in-plane. These findings establish CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ as a promising candidate for exploring electrically tunable flat-band correlations and topological magnetism in a multiferroic monolayer."

Moreover, we examine how the choice of crystal plane in contact with the fluid affects the accuracy of the phase boundary determination. The method is easy to implement and does not require prior knowledge of the binary fluid's equation of state.

Starting from a high-order spatial baseline discretisation (in this case, the CIP stabilised finite element method), our approach formulates the fully discrete problem as a variational inequality posed on a closed convex set of tensor-valued functions that respect the same eigenvalue bounds at their degrees of freedom. The numerical realisation of the scheme relies on the definition of a projection that, at each node, performs the diagonalisation of the tensor and then truncates the eigenvalues to lie within the prescribed bounds. The temporal discretisation is carried out using the implicit Euler method, and unconditional stability and optimal-order error estimates are proven for this choice. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate the method's ability to maintain eigenvalue constraints while accurately approximating solutions in the convection-dominated regime."

Our aim is to understand and control photon-assisted quantum transport in this two-dimensional material under external driving. We use the Floquet approximation to describe the wave functions in the three regions of the system. By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \\pm \\hbarω$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters. This highlights the potential of laser-driven MoS$_2$ structures for highly sensitive electromagnetic sensors and advanced optoelectronic devices."

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a prominent paradigm for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization."

This enables us to enumerate loop-free digraphs and oriented graphs with given in-degree and out-degree sequences, and obtain subgraph probabilities. Our theorems are not restricted to the near-regular case. As an application, we determine the expected permanent of sparse or very dense random matrices with given row and column sums; in the regular case, our formula holds over all densities. We also draw conclusions about the degrees of a random orientation of a random undirected graph with given degrees, including its number of Eulerian orientations."

    "abstract": "In radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning, multi-criteria optimization (MCO) supports efficient plan selection but is usually solved for population-based dosimetric criteria and ignores patient-specific biological risk, potentially compromising outcomes in high-risk patients. We propose risk-guided MCO, a one-shot method that embeds a clinical risk model into conventional MCO, enabling interactive navigation between dosimetric and biological endpoints. The proposed algorithm uses a special order relation to fuse the classical MCO sandwiching algorithm with bi-level optimization, restricting the Pareto set to plans that achieve improvement in the secondary risk objective for user-defined, acceptable loss in primary clinical objectives. Thus, risk-guided MCO generates risk-optimized counterparts of clinical plans in a single run rather than by sequential or lexicographic planning. To assess the performance, we retrospectively analyzed 19 lung cancer patients treated with RT. The endpoint was the risk of grade 2+ radiation pneumonitis (RP), modeled using bootstrapped stepwise logistics regression with interaction terms, including baseline lung function, smoking history, and dosimetric factors. The risk-guided plans yielded a mean reduction of 8.0% in total lung V20 and 9.5% in right lung V5, translating into an average RP risk reduction of 7.7% (range=0.3%-20.1%), with small changes in target coverage (mean -1.2 D98[%] for CTV) and modest increase in heart dose (mean +1.74 Gy). This study presents the first proof-of-concept for integrating biological risk models directly within multi-criteria RT planning, enabling an interactive balance between established population-wide dose protocols and individualized outcome prediction. Our results demonstrate that the risk-informed MCO can reduce the risk of RP while maintaining target coverage."

We present AECV-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal and vision-language models on realistic AEC artefacts via two complementary use cases: (i) object counting on 120 high-quality floor plans (doors, windows, bedrooms, toilets), and (ii) drawing-grounded document QA spanning 192 question-answer pairs that test text extraction (OCR), instance counting, spatial reasoning, and comparative reasoning over common drawing regions. Object-counting performance is reported using per-field exact-match accuracy and MAPE results, while document-QA performance is reported using overall accuracy and per-category breakdowns with an LLM-as-a-judge scoring pipeline and targeted human adjudication for edge cases. Evaluating a broad set of state-of-the-art models under a unified protocol, we observe a stable capability gradient; OCR and text-centric document QA are strongest (up to 0.95 accuracy), spatial reasoning is moderate, and symbol-centric drawing understanding - especially reliable counting of doors and windows - remains unsolved (often 0.40-0.55 accuracy) with substantial proportional errors. These results suggest that current systems function well as document assistants but lack robust drawing literacy, motivating domain-specific representations and tool-augmented, human-in-the-loop workflows for an efficient AEC automation."

Furthermore, we develop a kernel-theoretic interpretation showing that qWiener reservoirs naturally induce deep kernels, providing a principled framework for analysing their expressiveness. We further characterise the simplest qWiener instantiation, consisting of concatenated quantum harmonic oscillators, and show the difference with respect to the classical case. Finally, we empirically evaluate the architecture on standard reservoir computing benchmarks, demonstrating systematic performance gains over prior classical and quantum reservoir computing models."

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have attracted much attention due to their exceptional performance. However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods. Additionally, the probability of reward hacking problem in TNT's responses, which are classified as not using thinking, remains below 10% across all tested datasets."

    "abstract": "We investigate the possibility of neutrinos interacting with a scalar dark matter field and the resulting implications for neutrino oscillations in the long-baseline sector. As our Universe is predominantly composed of dark matter, neutrinos propagating over astrophysical and terrestrial baselines inevitably traverse a dark matter background. The coherent forward scattering of neutrinos in such a background induces a medium-dependent correction to the mass-squared term in the effective neutrino Hamiltonian having opposing signs for neutrinos and antineutrinos. We study how the elements of this correction matrix, arising from coherent forward scattering of neutrinos with scalar dark matter background referred to as dark non-standard interactions (dark NSI), modify neutrino oscillation probabilities. Furthermore, we also study the effect of the off-diagonal elements and the associated phases on the measurement of leptonic CP violating phase focusing on the upcoming long-baseline superbeam experiments DUNE and T2HK. We show that dark NSI can lead to substantial enhancement or suppression of CP-violation sensitivity, depending on the true values of the dark NSI phases $φ_{αβ}$. We further explored how the synergy of DUNE and T2HK can effectively mitigate the degeneracies due to the dark NSI phases, and can restore or even enhance the CP sensitivity as compared to the standard oscillation scenario."

The primary objective of image enhancement is to improve the readability of such degraded ancient images. This paper presents an image enhancement approach based on binarization and complementary preprocessing techniques for removing stains and enhancing unclear ancient text. The proposed methods are evaluated on different types of ancient scripts, including inscriptions on stone, metal plates, and historical documents. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves classification accuracies of 55.7%, 62%, and 65.6% for stone, metal plate, and document scripts, respectively, using the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifier. Using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, accuracies of 53.2%, 59.5%, and 67.8% are obtained. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement method in improving the readability of ancient Marathi inscription images."

First, we prove a lifespan lower bound in slow time with a \\emph{log-log} gain; in physical time this yields persistence at least on the scale $\\varepsilon^{-1}|\\log\\log \\varepsilon|$. Second, on any bootstrap window we establish a strong velocity-stability estimate with rate $O(\\varepsilon)$ in $L^2$, complementing Loeper's $O(1/\\varepsilon)$ existence time and $\\varepsilon^{2/3}$ weak convergence rate. The proofs combine the incompressible transport structure with a sharp elliptic control of the velocity gradient and a flow-based stability argument. Overall, the results give a clean quantitative bridge from SG$^{\\varepsilon}$ to Euler that is both longer-lived (by a log-log factor) and quantitatively stable in velocity."

    "abstract": "Monocular shape-from-polarization (SfP) leverages the intrinsic relationship between light polarization properties and surface geometry to recover surface normals from single-view polarized images, providing a compact and robust approach for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. Despite its potential, existing monocular SfP methods suffer from azimuth angle ambiguity, an inherent limitation of polarization analysis, that severely compromises reconstruction accuracy and stability. This paper introduces a novel segmentation-driven monocular SfP (SMSfP) framework that reformulates global shape recovery into a set of local reconstructions over adaptively segmented convex sub-regions. Specifically, a polarization-aided adaptive region growing (PARG) segmentation strategy is proposed to decompose the global convexity assumption into locally convex regions, effectively suppressing azimuth ambiguities and preserving surface continuity. Furthermore, a multi-scale fusion convexity prior (MFCP) constraint is developed to ensure local surface consistency and enhance the recovery of fine textural and structural details. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed approach, showing significant improvements in disambiguation accuracy and geometric fidelity compared with existing physics-based monocular SfP techniques."

    "abstract": "The perovskite-inspired bismuth halide semiconductor Cs3Bi2Br9 is widely investigated as photoactive material for light-conversion applications. However, charge generation and separation are inherently limited by its modest sunlight absorption and strong exciton binding energy, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that both the light absorption and exciton dissociation are improved by controlled substitution of Br with I via mechanochemical synthesis of Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9. X-ray diffraction and Raman analyses confirm atomic-level halide mixing and reveal a crystallographic phase transition near x = 0.8. From absorption measurements on thin films, we determine the absorption coefficient, Urbach tail, and exciton binding energy for several Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9 compositions. From here, we find that the band gap can be tuned from 2.59 to 1.93 eV (for x = 0.9), while exciton binding energies reach a minimum at x = 0.6. Finally, transient absorption spectroscopy measurements suggest a weak correlation between recombination lifetime and Urbach energy, where the longest lifetimes are observed for the materials with lowest disorder. These results offer valuable insights for designing stable bismuth halide semiconductors with favorable light absorption properties and charge carrier dynamics."

    "abstract": "The theoretical identification of crystalline topological materials has enjoyed sustained success in simplified materials models, often by singling out discrete symmetry operations protecting the topological phase. When band structure calculations of realistic materials are considered, complications often arise owing to the requirement of a consistent gauge in the Brillouin zone, or down to the fineness of its sampling. Yet, the Berry phase, acting as topological label, encodes geometrical properties of the system, and it should be easily accessible. Here, an expression for the Berry phase is obtained, thanks to analytical Bloch states constructed from an infinite series of Gaussian type orbitals. Two contributions in the Berry phase are identified, with one having an immediate geometric interpretation, being equal to the Zak phase. Eigenvalues of a modular symmetry, considered here for the first time in the context of crystalline solid state systems, are put in correspondence with the Zak phase: modular symmetries allow to define a non-trivial action for the spatial inversion also when the system does not have an inversion centre. The approach is showcased for the non-centrosymmetric space group no. 22 ($F222$), which is known to host symmetry equivalent Bloch states that can be distinguished by their Berry phase."

    "abstract": "Manual observation and monitoring of individual cows for disease detection present significant challenges in large-scale farming operations, as the process is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to reduced accuracy. The reliance on human observation often leads to delays in identifying symptoms, as the sheer number of animals can hinder timely attention to each cow. Consequently, the accuracy and precision of disease detection are significantly compromised, potentially affecting animal health and overall farm productivity. Furthermore, organizing and managing human resources for the manual observation and monitoring of cow health is a complex and economically demanding task. It necessitates the involvement of skilled personnel, thereby contributing to elevated farm maintenance costs and operational inefficiencies. Therefore, the development of an automated, low-cost, and reliable smart system is essential to address these challenges effectively. Although several studies have been conducted in this domain, very few have simultaneously considered the detection of multiple common diseases with high prediction accuracy. However, advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Cyber-Physical Systems have enabled the automation of cow health monitoring with enhanced accuracy and reduced operational costs. This study proposes an IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System framework designed to monitor the daily activities and health status of cow. A novel ML algorithm is proposed for the diagnosis of common cow diseases using collected physiological and behavioral data. The algorithm is designed to predict multiple diseases by analyzing a comprehensive set of recorded physiological and behavioral features, enabling accurate and efficient health assessment."

    "abstract": "Double polymer networks exhibit a striking enhancement of toughness compared to single networks, yet the microscopic mechanisms governing stress redistribution, damage evolution, and fracture remain incompletely understood. Using large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations under uniaxial deformation, we resolve bond scission statistics, local stress redistribution following individual bond-breaking events, and the spatiotemporal evolution of damage in single- and double-network architectures. We show that while the early mechanical response is dominated by the pre-stretched sacrificial network, damage evolution in double networks follows a qualitatively distinct pathway. In contrast to single networks, where anisotropic stress redistribution promotes rapid localization and catastrophic fracture, the presence of a soft matrix in double networks induces a screening of stress redistribution generated by sacrificial bond scission. This screening suppresses correlated rupture events and stabilizes multiple damage zones, leading to a strongly delocalized damage landscape over a broad deformation range. At larger strains, when the matrix becomes load-bearing, damage progressively localizes, ultimately triggering fracture. By isolating the dynamics of individual damage zones, we further demonstrate that matrix-mediated stress screening stabilizes defects and delays localization. Together, these results identify stress-screening-induced damage delocalization as a central microscopic mechanism underlying toughness enhancement in multiple-network elastomers."

In the algebraic setting, where straight-line programs can be interpreted as circuits over algebraic structures such as semigroups or groups, they have led to deep insights in computational complexity. A key result by Babai and Szemerédi (1984) showed that finite groups afford efficient compression via straight-line programs, enabling the design of a black-box computation model for groups. Building on their result, Fleischer (2019) placed the Cayley table membership problem for certain classes (pseudovarieties) of finite semigroups in NPOLYLOGTIME, and in some cases even in FOLL. He also provided a complete classification of pseudovarieties of finite monoids affording efficient compression. In this work, we complete this classification program initiated by Fleischer, characterizing precisely those pseudovarieties of finite semigroups that afford efficient compression via straight-line programs. Along the way, we also improve several known bounds on the length and width of straight-line programs over semigroups, monoids, and groups. These results lead to new upper bounds for the membership problem in the Cayley table model: for all pseudovarieties that afford efficient compression and do not contain any nonsolvable group, we obtain FOLL algorithms. In particular, we resolve a conjecture of Barrington, Kadau, Lange, and McKenzie (2001), showing that the membership problem for all solvable groups is in FOLL."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations and factual inaccuracies, especially in complex reasoning and fact verification tasks. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) systems aim to improve answer accuracy by enabling multiple LLM agents to engage in dialogue, promoting diverse reasoning and mutual verification. However, existing MAD frameworks primarily rely on internal knowledge or static documents, making them vulnerable to hallucinations. While MADKE introduces external evidence to mitigate this, its one-time retrieval mechanism limits adaptability to new arguments or emerging information during the debate. To address these limitations, We propose Tool-MAD, a multi-agent debate framework that enhances factual verification by assigning each agent a distinct external tool, such as a search API or RAG module. Tool-MAD introduces three key innovations: (1) a multi-agent debate framework where agents leverage heterogeneous external tools, encouraging diverse perspectives, (2) an adaptive query formulation mechanism that iteratively refines evidence retrieval based on the flow of the debate, and (3) the integration of Faithfulness and Answer Relevance scores into the final decision process, allowing the Judge agent to quantitatively assess the coherence and question alignment of each response and effectively detect hallucinations. Experimental results on four fact verification benchmarks demonstrate that Tool-MAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MAD frameworks, achieving up to 5.5% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, in medically specialized domains, Tool-MAD exhibits strong robustness and adaptability across various tool configurations and domain conditions, confirming its potential for broader real-world fact-checking applications."

We explain how non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can support eigenstates completely undetected by eigenvalues, with the unidirectional Hatano-Nelson model serving as both a minimal realization and universal paradigm for this phenomenon. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that this model contains not only hidden modes but multiple macroscopic hidden exceptional points that appear more generally in all systems with a non-trivial bulk winding. Our framework explains how the apparent bulk-edge correspondence failures in models like the non-Hermitian SSH chain instead reflect the systematic inability of the eigenvalue spectrum to detect certain eigenstates in systems with a skin-effect. These results establish the limitation of the eigenvalue spectrum and suggest how the eigenstate approach can lead to improved characterization of non-Hermitian topology."

Recently, AI models trained on EoR simulations have gained significant attention as a powerful and flexible option for inferring parameters from 21cm observations. However, previous works show that AI models trained on data from one simulator fail to generalize to data from another, raising doubts about AI models' ability to accurately infer parameters from observation. We develop a new strategy for training AI models on cosmological simulations based on the principle that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves model robustness by averaging out spurious and contradictory information. We train AI models on data from different combinations of four simulators, then compare the models' performance when predicting on data from held-out simulators acting as proxies for the real universe. We find that models trained on data from multiple simulators perform better on data from a held-out simulator than models trained on data from a single simulator, indicating that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves a model's ability to generalize. This result suggests that future EoR parameter inference methods can mitigate simulator-specific bias by incorporating multiple simulation approaches into their analyses."

Liquid State Machines (LSMs) offer a promising approach for low-power temporal processing in pervasive and neuromorphic systems, but their deployment remains challenging due to high hyperparameter sensitivity and the computational cost of traditional optimization methods that ignore energy constraints. This work presents EARL, an energy-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates Bayesian optimization with an adaptive reinforcement learning based selection policy to jointly optimize accuracy and energy consumption. EARL employs surrogate modeling for global exploration, reinforcement learning for dynamic candidate prioritization, and an early termination mechanism to eliminate redundant evaluations, substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EARL achieves 6 to 15 percent higher accuracy, 60 to 80 percent lower energy consumption, and up to an order of magnitude reduction in optimization time compared to leading hyperparameter tuning frameworks.

    "abstract": "The structure of dark matter haloes is often described by radial density profiles motivated by cosmological simulations. These are typically assumed to have a fixed functional form (e.g. NFW), with some free parameters that can be constrained with observations. However, relying on simulations has the disadvantage that the resulting profiles depend on the dark matter model and the baryonic physics implementation, which are highly uncertain. Instead, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations. This is done using a symbolic regression algorithm called Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR). ESR searches for the optimal analytic expression to fit data, combining both accuracy and simplicity. We apply ESR to a sample of 149 galaxy clusters from the HSC-XXL survey to identify which functional forms perform best across the entire sample of clusters. We identify density profiles that statistically outperform NFW under a minimum-description-length criterion. Within the radial range probed by the weak-lensing data ($R \\sim 0.3 - 3$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc), the highest-ranked ESR profiles exhibit shallow inner behaviour and a maximum in the density profile. As a practical application, we show how the best-fitting ESR models can be used to obtain enclosed mass estimates. We find masses that are, on average, higher than those derived using NFW, highlighting a source of potential bias when assuming the wrong density profile. These results have important knock-on effects for analyses that utilise clusters, for example cosmological constraints on $σ_8$ and $Ω_m$ from cluster abundance and clustering. Beyond the HSC dataset, the method is readily applicable to any data constraining the dark matter distribution in galaxies and galaxy clusters, such as other weak lensing surveys, galactic rotation curves, or complementary probes."

    "abstract": "In this study, we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings."

Here, we present two stochastic maps that unify phenomenological models by integrating fluctuating single-cell growth rates and size-dependent noise mechanisms with cell size control. One map is applicable to mother machine lineages and the other to lineage trees of exponentially-growing cell populations, which reveals that population dynamics alter size control measured in mother machine experiments. For example, an adder can become more sizer-like or more timer-like at the population level depending on the noise statistics. Our analysis of bacterial data identifies extrinsic noise as the dominant mechanism of size variability, characterized by a quadratic conditional variance-mean relationship for division size across growth conditions. This finding contradicts the reported independence of added size relative to birth size but is consistent with the adder property in terms of the independence of the mean added size. Finally, we derive a trade-off between population-growth-rate gain and division-size noise. Correlations between size control quantifiers and single-cell growth rates inferred from data indicate that bacteria prioritize a narrow division-size distribution over growth rate maximisation."

These materials underpin organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which translate such interactions into low-voltage signal amplification and sensing for applications in bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and memory. Despite their central role, OECT current-voltage transfer characteristics are often treated phenomenologically, as both the local multimodal dynamics and their connection to global device response remain unresolved. Here, we reveal that the transfer curve encodes a cascade of spatially localized electrochemical transitions, each associated with distinct changes in conductivity, stiffness, and morphology, fundamentally redefining it as a spatially resolved fingerprint of device's internal state. Using automated operando multimodal in-liquid scanning dielectric microscopy, we directly map these dynamics and identify region-specific electrochemical thresholds governing the interplay between source, channel, and drain. We found that the local tip-sample electrostatic force serves as a remarkable mechanistic observable of coupled multimodal dynamics in mixed conductors. A physically grounded model links it to general material, interfacial, and geometric parameters, enabling mechanistic interpretation and predictive insights. Our work provides a new framework for probing and understanding mixed conduction in ion-electron coupled systems."

By constraining the trunk with an initial schema and updating the branches and leaves, PersonaTree enables controllable growth, achieving memory compression while preserving consistency. Moreover, we train a lightweight MemListener via reinforcement learning with process-based rewards to produce structured, executable, and interpretable {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NO_OP} operations, thereby supporting the dynamic evolution of the personalized tree. During response generation, PersonaTree is directly leveraged to enhance outputs in latency-sensitive scenarios; when users require more details, the agentic mode is triggered to introduce details on-demand under the constraints of the PersonaTree. Experiments show that PersonaTree outperforms full-text concatenation and various personalized memory systems in suppressing contextual noise and maintaining persona consistency.

To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers."

    "abstract": "Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media. Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis. The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor. The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation."

Our method leverages a low-resolution drafter paired with learned up-samplers to propose candidate image tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Crucially, we incorporate a local rejection and resampling mechanism, enabling efficient correction of draft errors by focusing on spatial neighborhoods rather than raster-scan resampling after the first rejection. We demonstrate that MuLo-SD achieves substantial speedups - up to $\\mathbf{1.7\\times}$ - outperforming strong speculative decoding baselines such as EAGLE-2 and LANTERN in terms of acceleration, while maintaining comparable semantic alignment and perceptual quality. These results are validated using GenEval, DPG-Bench, and FID/HPSv2 on the MS-COCO 5k validation split.

We propose a material system that can efficiently block radiation up to the optical range while transmitting photons at low gigahertz frequencies. It is based on the effect that incident photons are strongly scattered when their wavelength is comparable to the size of particles embedded in a weakly absorbing medium (Mie-scattering). The goal of this work is to tailor the absorption and transmission spectrum of an non-magnetic epoxy resin containing sapphire spheres by simulating its dependence on the size distribution. Additionally, we fabricate several material compositions, characterize them, as well as other materials, at optical, infrared, and gigahertz frequencies. In the infrared region (stop band) the attenuation of the Mie-scattering optimized material is high and comparable to that of other commonly used filter materials. At gigahertz frequencies (pass-band), the prototype filter exhibits a high transmission at millikelvin temperatures, with an insertion loss of less than $0.4\\,$dB below $10\\,$GHz."

    "abstract": "Simulations of the dynamics generated by partial differential equations (PDEs) provide approximate, numerical solutions to initial value problems. Such simulations are ubiquitous in scientific computing, but the correctness of the results is usually not guaranteed. We propose a new method for the rigorous integration of parabolic PDEs, i.e., the derivation of rigorous and explicit error bounds between the numerically obtained approximate solution and the exact one, which is then proven to exist over the entire time interval considered. These guaranteed error bounds are obtained a posteriori, using a fixed point reformulation based on a piece-wise in time constant approximation of the linearization around the numerical solution. Our setup leads to relatively simple-to-understand estimates, which has several advantages. Most critically, it allows us to optimize various aspects of the proof, and in particular to provide an adaptive time-stepping strategy. In case the solution converges to a stable hyperbolic equilibrium, we are also able to prove this convergence, applying our rigorous integrator with a final, infinitely long timestep. We showcase the ability of our method to rigorously integrate over relatively long time intervals, and to capture non-trivial dynamics, via examples on the Swift--Hohenberg equation, the Ohta--Kawasaki equation and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We expect that the simplicity and efficiency of the approach will enable generalization to a wide variety of other parabolic PDEs, as well as applications to boundary value problems."

This connection yields a redshift-dependent upper bound on the allowed depth of voids and promotes this requirement to a new viability condition, complementary to standard stability criteria. As an example, we apply this void-based criterion to a linear parameterization in the scale factor constrained by theoretical and observational bounds; we find that $\\sim 60\\%$ of the parameter space is excluded, with most problematic models failing by $z\\lesssim 10$.

    "abstract": "Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) excelling in complex tasks present unique challenges for digital watermarking, as existing methods often disrupt logical coherence or incur high computational costs. Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity. Extensive experiments show ReasonMark surpasses state-of-the-art methods by reducing text Perplexity by 0.35, increasing translation BLEU score by 0.164, and raising mathematical accuracy by 0.67 points. These advancements are achieved alongside a 0.34% higher watermark detection AUC and stronger robustness to attacks, all with a negligible increase in latency. This work enables the traceable and trustworthy deployment of reasoning LLMs in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Node coloring is the task of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, while using as few colors as possible. It is the most widely studied instance of graph coloring and of central importance in graph theory; major results include the Four Color Theorem and work on the Hadwiger-Nelson Problem. As an abstraction of classical combinatorial optimization tasks, such as scheduling and resource allocation, it is also rich in practical applications. Here, we focus on a relaxed version, approximate $k$-coloring, which is the task of assigning at most $k$ colors to the nodes of a graph such that the number of edges whose vertices have the same color is approximately minimized. While classical approaches leverage mathematical programming or SAT solvers, recent studies have explored the use of machine learning. We follow this route and explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node coloring. We first present an optimized differentiable algorithm that improves a prior approach by Schuetz et al. with orthogonal node feature initialization and a loss function that penalizes conflicting edges more heavily when their endpoints have higher degree; the latter inspired by the classical result that a graph is $k$-colorable if and only if its $k$-core is $k$-colorable. Next, we introduce a lightweight greedy local search algorithm and show that it may be improved by recursively computing a $(k-1)$-coloring to use as a warm start. We then show that applying such recursive warm starts to the GNN approach leads to further improvements. Numerical experiments on a range of different graph structures show that while the local search algorithms perform best on small inputs, the GNN exhibits superior performance at scale. The recursive warm start may be of independent interest beyond graph coloring for local search methods for combinatorial optimization."

In both cases, we prove interior Lipschitz-estimates on a transport-like map and interior gradient Lipschitz-estimates on the potentials, under the assumption that the transport map solving the unregularised problem is bi-$C^{1,α}$-regular. For strictly subquadratic and entropic regularisation, the estimates improve to interior $C^1$ and $C^2$ estimates for the transport-like map and the potentials, respectively. Our estimates are uniform in the regularisation parameter. As a consequence of this, we obtain convergence of the transport-like map (resp. the potentials) to the unregularised transport map (resp. Kantorovich potentials) in $C^{0,1-}_{\\mathrm{loc}}$ (resp. $C^{1,1-}_{\\mathrm{loc}}$). Central to our approach are sharp local bounds on the size of the support for regularised optimal transport which we derive for a general convex, superlinear regularisation term. These bounds are of independent interest and imply global bias bounds for the regularised transport plans. Our global bounds, while not necessarily sharp, improve on the best known results in the literature for quadratic regularisation."

This work introduces a **memory-weighted velocity operator** \\(\\mathscr{V}_{α,β}\\) designed to quantify rates of change while incorporating time-varying, power-law memory. The operator is defined via a kernel with two independent, continuous memory exponents \\(α(t)\\) and \\(β(t)\\), which separately weight the influence of past state increments and the scaling of elapsed time. For a function \\(x\\), the resulting quantity \\(\\mathscr{V}_{α,β}[x]\\) represents its memory-weighted rate of change.

Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's α = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (α < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an \"evaluative disposition\" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality. Averaging their scores produces a synthetic verdict that corresponds to no judge's actual values."

In the present work, we present a unitary, scalable, distance-preserving encoding scheme for preparing Pauli eigenstates in surface codes. Unlike previous unitary approaches whose fault-distance remains constant with increasing code distance, our scheme ensures that the protection offered by the code is preserved during state preparation. Building on strategies discovered by reinforcement learning for the surface-17 code, we generalize the construction to arbitrary code distances and both rotated and unrotated surface codes. The proposed encoding relies only on geometrically local gates, and is therefore fully compatible with planar 2D qubit connectivity, and it achieves circuit depth scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(d)$, consistent with fundamental entanglement-generation bounds. We design explicit stabilizer-expanding circuits with and without ancilla-mediated connectivity and analyze their error-propagation behavior. Numerical simulations under depolarizing noise show that our unitary encoding without ancillas outperforms standard stabilizer-measurement-based schemes, reducing logical error rates by up to an order of magnitude. These results make the scheme particularly relevant for platforms such as trapped ions and neutral atoms, where measurements are costly relative to gates and idling noise is considerably weaker than gate noise. Our work bridges the gap between measurement-based and unitary encodings of surface-code states and opens new directions for distance-preserving state preparation in fault-tolerant quantum computation."

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by explicitly generating multi-step chains of thought, but this capability incurs substantial inference latency and computational cost. Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the \"Aha Moment\" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25. These results suggest a simple yet effective mechanism for reasoning: allocating computation based on a glimpse of thought rather than full-step evaluation."

We present ECLIPSE, an evolutionary computation framework built to interface directly with complex, domain-specific simulation tools while supporting flexible geometric and parametric representations of scientific hardware. ECLIPSE provides a modular architecture consisting of (1) Individuals, which encode hardware designs using domain-aware, physically constrained representations; (2) Evaluators, which prepare simulation inputs, invoke external simulators, and translate the simulator's outputs into fitness measures; and (3) Evolvers, which implement EC algorithms suitable for high-cost, limited-throughput environments. We demonstrate the utility of ECLIPSE across several active space-science applications, including evolved 3D antennas and spacecraft geometries optimized for drag reduction in very low Earth orbit. We further discuss the practical challenges encountered when coupling EC with scientific simulation workflows, including interoperability constraints, parallelization limits, and extreme evaluation costs, and outline ongoing efforts to combat these challenges. ECLIPSE enables interdisciplinary teams of physicists, engineers, and EC researchers to collaboratively explore unconventional designs for scientific hardware while leveraging existing domain-specific simulation software."

When the electric field magnitude is tuned to a sequence of discrete values, different levels of energy bands are flattened. Moreover, at a specific electric field strength, the ground-state wave function admits an exact closed-form solution that can be understood through the magnetic drifts cancellation in the classical electrodynamics. We also demonstrate two distinct transmission properties, the quantized Hall conductance and the enhanced density of states, of the electrically switchable flat band. These findings establish a new route toward magnetoelectric band engineering and electrically guided transport in low-dimensional systems."

The second step yields the class of axially monogenic functions by applying the pointwise differential operator Delta_{n+1}^{(n-1)/2}, with n odd, known as the Fueter-Sce map. The significance of the Fueter-Sce theorem also lies in the fact that it induces two spectral theories corresponding to the function classes it generates. Over the years, factorizations of the Fueter-Sce map have been studied to identify the intermediate spaces that arise between slice hyperholomorphic functions and axially monogenic functions. Until now, only certain factorizations of the Fueter-Sce map have been considered.

    "abstract": "We discuss the initial value problem for the Einstein equations in Hitchin's generalised geometry for the case of closed divergence (which correspond to the equations of motion in the bosonic part of the NS-NS sector in type II ten-dimensional supergravity) and establish the existence of a maximal globally hyperbolic development (MGHD). The dynamical fields, defined on a manifold of dimension $n+1$, are the space-time metric, a scalar field known as the dilaton function, and a two-form known as the $B$-field. We develop a generalisation of the Lorenz gauge which, applied to the $B$-field (and combined with a suitable gauge condition breaking diffeomorphism invariance), renders the system a wave equation with principal symbol given by the (dynamical) metric. Given initial data, we construct a development satisfying the gauge conditions. We show that all other developments are (in the appropriate sense) related to this development by a diffeomorphism, establishing geometric uniqueness. The existence of the MGHD follows then by a famous result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch. In showing existence and geometric uniqueness of developments, we follow an approach developed in detail by Ringström for the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field. In a preliminary section, we present a formulation which is disentangled from the specific assumptions made on the matter, so that adaptation to other systems is straightforward."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps LLMs stay accurate, but feeding long documents into a prompt makes the model slow and expensive. This has motivated context compression, ranging from token pruning and summarization to embedding-based compression. While researchers have tried ''compressing'' these documents into smaller summaries or mathematical embeddings, there is a catch: the more you compress the data, the more the LLM struggles to understand it. To address this challenge, we propose ArcAligner (Adaptive recursive context *Aligner*), a lightweight module integrated into the language model layers to help the model better utilize highly compressed context representations for downstream generation. It uses an adaptive ''gating'' system that only adds extra processing power when the information is complex, keeping the system fast. Across knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks, ArcAligner consistently beats compression baselines at comparable compression rates, especially on multi-hop and long-tail settings.

    "abstract": "The concept of Critical Batch Size, as pioneered by OpenAI, has long served as a foundational principle for large-scale pre-training. However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality."

However, most existing methods rely on statically selecting top-k passages based on individual relevance, which fails to exploit combinatorial gains among passages and often introduces substantial redundancy. To address this limitation, we propose OptiSet, a set-centric framework that unifies set selection and set-level ranking for RAG. OptiSet adopts an \"Expand-then-Refine\" paradigm: it first expands a query into multiple perspectives to enable a diverse candidate pool and then refines the candidate pool via re-selection to form a compact evidence set. We then devise a self-synthesis strategy without strong LLM supervision to derive preference labels from the set conditional utility changes of the generator, thereby identifying complementary and redundant evidence. Finally, we introduce a set-list wise training strategy that jointly optimizes set selection and set-level ranking, enabling the model to favor compact, high-gain evidence sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiSet improves performance on complex combinatorial problems and makes generation more efficient. The source code is publicly available."

Notably, this demonstrates for the first time that the contour integral method can be extended to the regularized setting (including the case $k_r=1$), thereby overcoming a limitation of previous approaches. Our results not only provide explicit parity relations at arbitrary depths but also lay the groundwork for extending this technique to other variants of multiple zeta values."

However, they remain difficult to obtain due to privacy constraints, data sensitivity, and the cost of building controlled collection environments such as testbeds and cyber ranges. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can operate as controlled knowledge-to-data engines for generating structured synthetic network traffic datasets suitable for IDS research. We propose a methodology that combines protocol documentation, attack semantics, and explicit statistical rules to condition LLMs without fine-tuning or access to raw samples. Using the AWID3 IEEE~802.11 benchmark as a demanding case study, we generate labeled datasets with four state-of-the-art LLMs and assess fidelity through a multi-level validation framework including global similarity metrics, per-feature distribution testing, structural comparison, and cross-domain classification. Results show that, under explicit constraints, LLM-generated datasets can closely approximate the statistical and structural characteristics of real network traffic, enabling gradient-boosting classifiers to achieve F1-scores up to 0.956 when evaluated on real samples. Overall, the findings suggest that constrained LLM-driven generation can facilitate on-demand IDS experimentation, providing a testbed-free, privacy-preserving alternative that overcomes the traditional bottlenecks of physical traffic collection and manual labeling."

Testing the \"Hán Dān Xué Bù\" (Superficial Mimicry) hypothesis across 14 models, we find that distillation induces a \"Functional Alignment Collapse\": while teacher models mirror human difficulty scaling ($\\bar{r}=0.64$), distilled students significantly degrade this alignment ($\\bar{r}=0.34$), often underperforming their own pre-distillation baselines (\"Negative Transfer\"). Our analysis suggests that SFT induces a \"Cargo Cult\" effect, where students ritualistically replicate the linguistic form of reasoning (verbosity) without internalizing the teacher's dynamic resource allocation policy. Consequently, reasoning distillation decouples computational cost from cognitive demand, revealing that human-like cognition is an emergent property of active reinforcement, not passive imitation."

Our findings reveal that LLMs lack an inherent ability to detect and correct subtle distortions in table representations. Only when provided with an explicit prior, via a system prompt, do models partially adjust their reasoning strategies and correct some distortions, though not consistently or completely. To study this phenomenon, we introduce a small, expert-curated dataset that explicitly evaluates LLMs on table question answering (TQA) tasks requiring an additional error-correction step prior to analysis. Our results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs ingest and interpret tabular information under distortion, with even SoTA models such as GPT-5.2 model exhibiting a drop of minimum 22% accuracy under distortion. These findings raise important questions for future research, particularly regarding when and how models should autonomously decide to realign tabular inputs, analogous to human behavior, without relying on explicit prompts or tabular data pre-processing."

These behaviors may be even harder to identify within subcultural groups due to their unique expressions. As large language models (LLMs) are applied across various fields, some researchers have begun exploring their application for detecting self-destructive behaviors. Motivated by this, we investigate self-destructive behavior detection within subcultures using current LLM-based methods. However, these methods have two main challenges: (1) Knowledge Lag: Subcultural slang evolves rapidly, faster than LLMs' training cycles; and (2) Semantic Misalignment: it is challenging to grasp the specific and nuanced expressions unique to subcultures. To address these issues, we proposed Subcultural Alignment Solver (SAS), a multi-agent framework that incorporates automatic retrieval and subculture alignment, significantly enhancing the performance of LLMs in detecting self-destructive behavior. Our experimental results show that SAS outperforms the current advanced multi-agent framework OWL. Notably, it competes well with fine-tuned LLMs. We hope that SAS will advance the field of self-destructive behavior detection in subcultural contexts and serve as a valuable resource for future researchers."

This perspective reveals recurring properties that affect all the methods under analysis: (i) non-uniform group weighting induces systematic gradient biases on shared prefix tokens; (ii) interactions with the AdamW optimizer make training dynamics largely insensitive to reward scaling; and (iii) optimizer momentum can push policy updates beyond the intended clipping region under repeated optimization steps. We believe that these findings highlight fundamental limitations of current approaches and provide principled guidance for the design of future formulations."

Despite its relative proximity, the 3D structure of the CMZ remains poorly constrained, primarily due to projection effects. We aim to constrain the line-of-sight location of two molecular clouds in the CMZ -- the 50 and 20 km/s clouds -- and to investigate their possible physical connection using stellar kinematics and photometry. This study serves as a pilot for future applications across the full CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight position of the clouds by analysing stellar kinematics, stellar densities, and stellar populations towards the cloud regions and a control field. We find an absence of westward moving stars in the cloud regions, which indicates that they lie on the near side of the CMZ. This interpretation is supported by the stellar density distributions. The similar behaviour observed in the two clouds, as well as in the region between them (the ridge), suggests that they are located at comparable distances and are physically linked. We also identified an intermediate-age stellar population (2-7 Gyr) in both regions, consistent with that observed on the near side of the CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight distances at which the clouds and the ridge become kinematically detectable (i.e. where the proper motion component parallel to the Galactic plane differs from that of the control field at the 3 sigma level) by converting their measured proper motions parallel to the Galactic plane using a theoretical model of the stellar distribution. We find that the 50 and 20 km/s clouds are located at $43\\pm8$ pc and $56\\pm11$ pc from Sgr A*, respectively, and that the ridge lies at $56\\pm11$ pc; this supports the idea that the clouds are physically connected through the ridge."

Extending this analysis, we investigate suppression as a generalized method of choosing, or omitting, records. Developing a theoretical analysis of this technique, we derive privacy bounds for arbitrary suppression strategies under unbounded approximate DP. We find that our tested suppression strategy also fails to improve the privacy-utility tradeoff. Surprisingly, uniform sampling emerges as one of the best suppression methods -- despite its still degrading effect. Our results call into question common preprocessing assumptions in DP practice."

We propose projective conditioning, which replaces raw camera parameters with a target-view projective cue that provides a stable 2D input. This reframes the task from a brittle geometric regression problem in ray space to a well-conditioned target-view image-to-image translation problem. Additionally, we introduce a masked autoencoding pretraining strategy tailored to this cue, enabling the use of large-scale uncalibrated data for pretraining. Our method shows improved fidelity and stronger cross-view consistency compared to ray-conditioned baselines on our view-consistency benchmark. It also achieves state-of-the-art quality on standard novel view synthesis benchmarks."

This greatly limits the real applications of REx (RES/REC/REG). This paper introduces three new benchmarks called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), Comprehension (GREC), and Generation (GREG), collectively denoted as GREx, which extend the classic REx to allow expressions to identify an arbitrary number of objects. We construct the first large-scale GREx dataset gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions and their corresponding images with labeled targets. GREx and gRefCOCO are designed to be backward-compatible with REx, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing REx methods on GREx tasks. One of the challenges of GRES/GREC is complex relationship modeling, for which we propose a baseline ReLA that adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues and explicitly models the region-region and region-language dependencies. The proposed ReLA achieves the state-of-the-art results on the both GRES and GREC tasks. The proposed gRefCOCO dataset and method are available at https://henghuiding.github.io/GREx."

Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic \"mass gap,\" maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \\times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \\to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold."

    "abstract": "Camera-controlled generative video re-rendering methods, such as ReCamMaster, have achieved remarkable progress. However, despite their success in single-view setting, these works often struggle to maintain consistency across multi-view scenarios. Ensuring spatio-temporal coherence in hallucinated regions remains challenging due to the inherent stochasticity of generative models. To address it, we introduce PlenopticDreamer, a framework that synchronizes generative hallucinations to maintain spatio-temporal memory. The core idea is to train a multi-in-single-out video-conditioned model in an autoregressive manner, aided by a camera-guided video retrieval strategy that adaptively selects salient videos from previous generations as conditional inputs. In addition, Our training incorporates progressive context-scaling to improve convergence, self-conditioning to enhance robustness against long-range visual degradation caused by error accumulation, and a long-video conditioning mechanism to support extended video generation. Extensive experiments on the Basic and Agibot benchmarks demonstrate that PlenopticDreamer achieves state-of-the-art video re-rendering, delivering superior view synchronization, high-fidelity visuals, accurate camera control, and diverse view transformations (e.g., third-person to third-person, and head-view to gripper-view in robotic manipulation).

    "abstract": "We present a general method to reproduce a given cosmological background through energy exchange between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). This can be simply realized with a standard quintessence scalar field that controls the DM mass. In particular a background with phantom crossing can be effectively realized without introducing ghosts or other pathologies. For example one can reproduce exactly the background that gives the best fit to the recent DESI+CMB+DESY5 data, within the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of DE. Although the background evolution is identical, the perturbations differ, leading to modified growth of structures. If the DM mass varies at late times, early-time observables are not modified and can reproduce the main predictions of the target model, but late-time observables are affected. We discuss in particular the effects on the matter power spectrum, CMB lensing and ISW effect. When reproducing the best fit CPL background model, this scenario generically predicts $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ deviations in such observables. However, for suitable choices of parameters, effects on the matter power spectrum can be smaller, motivating a detailed study. In general, energy exchange between DE and DM generates a mismatch between the matter power spectrum and the gravitational potential amplitudes compared to the decoupled case, that can lead to deviations observable in future experiments."

Minary represents interacting probabilistic events as multi-dimensional vectors and combines them via linear superposition rather than multiplicative scalar operations, thereby preserving uncertainty and enabling constructive and destructive interference in the range $[-1,1]$. A fixed set of ``perspectives'' evaluates ``semantic dimensions'' according to hidden competencies, and their interactions drive two discrete-time stochastic processes. We model this system as an iterated random affine map and use the theory of iterated random functions to prove that it converges in distribution to a unique stationary law; we moreover obtain an explicit closed form for the limiting expectation in terms of row, column, and global averages of the competency matrix. We then derive exact formulas for the mean and variance of the normalized consensus conditioned on the activation of a given semantic dimension, revealing how consensus depends on competency structure rather than raw input signals. Finally, we argue that Minary is organizationally closed yet operationally open in the sense of Maturana and Varela, and we discuss implications for building self-maintaining, distributed, and parallelizable computational systems that house a uniquely subjective notion of identity."

    "abstract": "Online political divisions, such as fragmentation or polarization, are a growing global concern that can foster radicalization and hinder democratic cooperation; however, not all divisions are detrimental, some reflect pluralism and healthy diversity of opinion in a democracy. While prior research has predominantly focused on polarization in the United States, there remains a limited body of research on political divides in multiparty systems, and no universal method for comparing fragmentation across countries. Moreover, cross-country comparison is rare. This study first develops a novel measure of structural political fragmentation built on multi-scale community detection and the effective branching factor. Using a dataset of 18,325 political influencers from Brazil, Spain, and the United States, we assess online fragmentation in their Twitter/X co-following networks. We compare the fragmentation of the three countries, as well as the ideological groups within each. We further investigate factors associated with the level of fragmentation in each country. We find that political fragmentation differs across countries and is asymmetric between ideological groups. Brazil is the most fragmented, with higher fragmentation among the left-wing group, while Spain and the United States exhibit similar overall levels, with the left more fragmented in Spain and the right more fragmented in the United States. Additionally, we find that social identity plays a central role in political fragmentation. A strong alignment between ideological and social identities, with minimal overlap between ideologies, tends to promote greater integration and reduce fragmentation. Our findings provide explanations for cross-national and ideological differences in political fragmentation."

While quantitative MRI (qMRI) offers intrinsic tissue parameters, the requirement for specialized acquisition protocols and reconstruction algorithms restricts its availability and impedes large-scale biomarker research. This study presents a self-supervised physics-guided deep learning framework to infer quantitative T1, T2, and proton-density (PD) maps directly from widely available clinical conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR MRIs. The framework was trained and evaluated on a large-scale, clinically heterogeneous dataset comprising 4,121 scan sessions acquired at our institution over six years on four different 3 T MRI scanner systems, capturing real-world clinical variability. The framework integrates Bloch-based signal models directly into the training objective. Across more than 600 test sessions, the generated maps exhibited white matter and gray matter values consistent with literature ranges. Additionally, the generated maps showed invariance to scanner hardware and acquisition protocol groups, with inter-group coefficients of variation $\\leq$ 1.1%. Subject-specific analyses demonstrated excellent voxel-wise reproducibility across scanner systems and sequence parameters, with Pearson $r$ and concordance correlation coefficients exceeding 0.82 for T1 and T2. Mean relative voxel-wise differences were low across all quantitative parameters, especially for T2 ($<$ 6%). These results indicate that the proposed framework can robustly transform diverse clinical conventional MRI data into quantitative maps, potentially paving the way for large-scale quantitative biomarker research."

A single research session using a 70-billion parameter model can cost around $127 in cloud fees, putting these tools out of reach for many academic labs. We developed AgentCompress to tackle this problem head-on. The core idea came from a simple observation during our own work: writing a novel hypothesis clearly demands more from the model than reformatting a bibliography. Why should both tasks run at full precision? Our system uses a small neural network to gauge how hard each incoming task will be, based only on its opening words, then routes it to a suitably compressed model variant. The decision happens in under a millisecond. Testing across 500 research workflows in four scientific fields, we cut compute costs by 68.3% while keeping 96.2% of the original success rate. For labs watching their budgets, this could mean the difference between running experiments and sitting on the sidelines"

By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 > -1. Finally, an analysis of the energy emission rate shows that higher electric charge enhances black hole evaporation, while stronger nonlinear electrodynamics effects and larger values of fR0 suppress it."

    "abstract": "The field of learning analytics has made notable strides in automating the detection of complex learning processes in multimodal data. However, most advancements have focused on individualized problem-solving instead of collaborative, open-ended problem-solving, which may offer both affordances (richer data) and challenges (low cohesion) to behavioral prediction. Here, we extend predictive models to automatically detect socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) behaviors in collaborative computational modeling environments using embedding-based approaches. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as summarization tools to generate task-aware representations of student dialogue aligned with system logs. These summaries, combined with text-only embeddings, context-enriched embeddings, and log-derived features, were used to train predictive models. Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection. Overall, our findings highlight the promise of embedding-based models for extending learning analytics by enabling scalable detection of SSRL behaviors, ultimately supporting real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments that teachers value."

    "abstract": "The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will carry out a wide-field imaging and slitless spectroscopic survey of Type Ia Supernovae to improve our understanding of dark energy. Crucial to this endeavor is obtaining supernova spectra uncontaminated by light from their host galaxies. However, obtaining such spectra is made more difficult by the inherent problem in wide-field slitless spectroscopic surveys: the blending of spectra of close objects. The spectrum of a supernova will blend with the host galaxy, even from regions distant from the supernova on the sky. If not properly removed, this contamination will introduce systematic bias when the supernova spectra are later used to determine intrinsic supernova parameters and to infer the parameters of dark energy. To address this problem we developed an algorithm that makes use of the spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy at all available observatory roll angles to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3d; 2d spatial, 1d spectral) representation of the underlying host galaxy that accurately matches the 2d slitless spectrum of the host galaxy when projected to an arbitrary rotation angle. We call this ``scene reconstruction''. The projection of the reconstructed scene can be subtracted from an observation of a supernova to remove the contamination from the underlying host. Using simulated Roman data, we show that our method has extremely small systematic errors and significantly less random noise than if we subtracted a single perfectly aligned spectrum of the host obtained before or after the supernova was visible."

Further, since curating large annotated datasets for meme moderation is prohibitively expensive, we propose a novel framework that leverages task-specific generative multimodal agents and the few-shot adaptability of large multimodal models to cater to different types of memes. We believe this is the first work focused on generalizable hateful meme moderation under limited data conditions, and has strong potential for deployment in real-world production scenarios.

In this paper, we describe \\texttt{sidmkit}, a transparent and reproducible Python package designed to support SIDM ``micro$\\rightarrow$macro'' calculations and to provide a robust batch pipeline for fitting rotation curves in the SPARC data.

It also provides consistent velocity-moment averaging for Maxwellian relative speeds, scattering-rate utilities, and curated literature \\emph{summary} constraints for regression tests and exploratory scans. On the rotation-curve side, we implement bounded non-linear least squares fits of NFW and Burkert halo models to SPARC baryonic decompositions, with optional mass-to-light priors and information-criterion summaries (AIC/BIC). For the demonstration dataset, we process 191 \\texttt{rotmod} galaxies (LTG+ETG bundles) and fit both NFW and Burkert models (382 total fits).

We find that across different types of automatic classifiers and various underlying emotions, error rates are consistently higher for texts authored by men compared to those authored by women. We quantify how this bias could affect results in downstream applications and show that current machine learning tools, including large language models, should be applied with caution when the gender composition of a sample is not known or variable. Our findings demonstrate that sentiment analysis is not yet a solved problem, especially in ensuring equitable model behaviour across demographic groups."

However, quantitative and non-perturbative methods for determining impurity thermodynamics in such settings remain scarce. Here, we introduce an impurity renormalization group approach that merges the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme. This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime. We also observe an exotic evolution of the spin correlation function driven by the interplay between bath correlations and the impurity. Our results demonstrate that this method can efficiently solve correlated systems with defects, opening new pathways to discovering novel impurity physics beyond those in non-interacting thermal baths."

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances decision transparency, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fails to fully exploit its potential, and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches face instability and suboptimal reasoning depth. We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations. Then, we apply progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset. The results show that ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy, respectively.

Occasionally, T-sensors close to the seafloor register minute-long flashes of 0.0005-0.001degrC warmer than the environment. When singular, such flashes may be artefacts. However, in a large mooring-array with 45 vertical lines at 9.5-m horizontal distances, near-seafloor heat flashes are seen to travel, most likely with internal-wave instabilities in overlying stratified waters. The instabilities seem to release the flashes from a geothermally heated seafloor of which turbulence convection is suppressed by warmer waters from above. The forms and turbulence intensity of these rare signals are compared with those induced by a Remotely Operated Vehicle working near the array.

However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met. Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks demonstrate that TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment."

    "abstract": "In the process of digital transformation, enterprises are faced with problems such as insufficient semantic understanding of unstructured data and lack of intelligent decision-making basis in driving mechanisms. This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge."

    "abstract": "Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-based MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to solve complex tasks, have shown impressive performance in many areas. However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs."

In this context, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling natural-language interfaces for Internet of Things (IoT) control. However, existing LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable and inefficient device control due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, high inference latency and cost, and limited personalization. To address these challenges, we present IoTGPT, an LLM-based smart home agent designed to execute IoT commands in a reliable, efficient, and personalized manner. Inspired by how humans manage complex tasks, IoTGPT decomposes user instructions into subtasks and memorizes them. By reusing learned subtasks, subsequent instructions can be processed more efficiently with fewer LLM calls, improving reliability and reducing both latency and cost. IoTGPT also supports fine-grained personalization by adapting individual subtasks to user preferences. Our evaluation demonstrates that IoTGPT outperforms baselines in accuracy, latency/cost, and personalization, while reducing user workload."

This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions."

    "abstract": "A central topic in extremal graph theory is the supersaturation problem, which studies the minimum number of copies of a fixed substructure that must appear in any graph with more edges than the corresponding Turán number. Significant works due to Erdős, Rademacher, Lovász and Simonovits investigated the supersaturation problem for the triangle. Moreover, Kang, Makai and Pikhurko studied the case for the bowtie, which consists of two triangles sharing a vertex. Building upon the pivotal results established by Bollobás, Nikiforov, Ning and Zhai on counting triangles via the spectral radius, we study in this paper the spectral supersaturation problem for the bowtie. Let $λ(G)$ be the spectral radius of a graph $G$, and let $K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil, \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}^q$ be the graph obtained from Turán graph $T_{n,2}$ by adding $q$ pairwise disjoint edges to the partite set of size $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil$. Firstly, we prove that there exists an absolute constant $δ>0$ such that if $n$ is sufficiently large, $2\\le q \\le δ\\sqrt{n}$, and $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with $λ(G)\\ge λ(K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil, \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}^q)$, then $G$ contains at least ${q\\choose 2}\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor$ bowties, and $K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil, \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}^q$ is the unique spectral extremal graph. This solves an open problem proposed by Li, Feng and Peng. Secondly, we show that a graph $G$ whose spectral radius exceeds that of the spectral extremal graph for the bowtie must contain at least $\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2}\\rfloor$ bowties. This sharp bound reveals a distinct phenomenon from the edge-supersaturation case, which guarantees at least $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor$ bowties."

When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts."

    "abstract": "Communication robots often need to initiate conversations with people in public spaces. At the same time, such robots must not disturb pedestrians. To handle these two requirements, an agent needs to estimate the communication desires of others based on their behavior and then adjust its own communication activities accordingly. In this study, we construct a computational spatial interaction model that considers others. Consideration is expressed as a quantitative parameter: the amount of adjustment of one's internal state to the estimated internal state of the other. To validate the model, we experimented with a human and a virtual robot interacting in a VR environment. The results show that when the participant moves to the target, a virtual robot with a low consideration value inhibits the participant's movement, while a robot with a higher consideration value did not inhibit the participant's movement. When the participant approached the robot, the robot also exhibited approaching behavior, regardless of the consideration value, thus decreasing the participant's movement. These results appear to verify the proposed model's ability to clarify interactions with consideration for others."

    "abstract": "In this article we show that the condensation mechanism in cuprates involves the strong coupling of the condensate to pairon excited states. We present an accessible formalism that significantly extends our previous work, providing a theoretical basis for the energy-dependent gap function $Δ(E)$. The latter is proportional to the effective spin exchange energy, $J_{eff}$, with no retardation effects, such as the case of spin-fluctuation or phonon mediated couplings. The fundamental parameters of the superconducting (SC) state are the condensation energy per pair, $β_c$, and the antinodal energy gap, $Δ_p$, which are quantitatively extracted by fitting the cuprate quasiparticle spectrum from tunneling experiments. An explicit formula for the critical temperature is also derived in the model. Valid for any doping, we find $T_c$ to be proportional to $β_c$, and not the gap $Δ_p$, in sharp contrast to conventional SC. The numerical factor $β_c/k_BT_c\\simeq 2.24$ originates from pair excitations of the condensate, following Bose statistics, with a mini-gap $δ_M \\simeq 1\\,$meV in the excitation spectrum. These results strongly suggest that the same `all-electron' mechanism is at work all along the $T_c$-dome."

In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all baselines in both effectiveness and robustness in most evaluation settings."

However, probing the interfacial superconductivity at buried interfaces is challenging with conventional surface methods. Here, we present a theoretical study of the longitudinal optical response of a TI-SC heterostructure, focusing on the complex interface sheet conductance as a direct and layer-selective probe of the interfacial superconducting gap. Within a minimal TI--SC model, we demonstrate that proximity-induced superconductivity at the buried interface generates a two-dimensional topological superconducting phase supporting Majorana edge modes. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes slab model and the Kubo formalism, we compute the optical conductance and introduce a thickness-extrapolation protocol that isolates the interface contribution only. The resulting interface conductance exhibits a robust, thickness-independent coherence peak at an energy set by the proximity-induced gap, distinguishable from both the parent superconductor's pair-breaking feature and the ungapped Dirac cone on the top surface. We further demonstrate that the low-frequency spectral weight of this interface resonance obeys a quantum-metric sum rule, quantitatively linking the optical response to the quantum geometry of the proximitized interfacial state. Our results propose terahertz/infrared spectroscopy of the interfacial sheet conductance as a non-invasive diagnostic of Majorana-hosting TI--SC interfaces."

Because of its role in supporting life, the uncertainty surrounding the catalytic cycle, and its compositional richness with eight transition metal ions, FeMo-co has fascinated scientists for decades. After much effort, the complete atomic structure was resolved. However, its electronic structure, central to reactivity, remains under intense debate. FeMo-co's complexity, arising from many unpaired electrons, has led to suggestions that it lies beyond the reach of classical computing. Consequently, there has been much interest in the potential of quantum algorithms to compute its electronic structure. Estimating the cost to compute the ground-state to chemical accuracy (~1 kcal/mol) within one or more FeMo-co models is a common benchmark of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry, with numerous resource estimates in the literature. Here we address how to perform the same task using classical computation. We use a 76 orbital/152 qubit resting state model, the subject of most quantum resource estimates. Based on insight into the multiple configuration nature of the states, we devise classical protocols that yield rigorous or empirical upper bounds to the ground-state energy. Extrapolating these we predict the ground-state energy with an estimated uncertainty on the order of chemical accuracy. Having performed this long-discussed computational task, we next consider implications beyond the model. We distill a simpler computational procedure which we apply to reveal the electronic landscape in realistic representations of the cofactor. We thus illustrate a path to a precise computational understanding of FeMo-co electronic structure."

Using wide-field ($1^{\\circ} \\times 1^{\\circ}$) data from the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT), we extend measurements of the cluster's properties beyond its $R_{500}$ radius. We detect surface-brightness excesses on both the northern and southern sides, consistent with previous XMM-Newton results. The temperature, pressure, and entropy in the northern excess region are lower than the average values, whereas those on the southern side are slightly higher. However, we find no evidence for cold fronts or shocks. These features can be interpreted as sloshing motions triggered by an off-center minor merger. Our findings suggest that, despite its symmetric appearance, A3571 is still recovering from a minor merger and is currently in a post-merger phase.

    "abstract": "Modeling human decision-making is central to applications such as recommendation, preference learning, and human-AI alignment. While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance while providing greater transparency into the drivers of choice."

    "abstract": "Germanane (GeH) is essentially a hydrogen-terminated Ge analog of graphene with a direct gap (~1.6 eV). Record hole mobility mu_h~67,000 cm2/Vs is found at 15 K for a single allotropic cross-dimensional(D) heterointerface. This is enabled by making topotactically-transformed 2D GeH layers meet the 3D bulk Ge(111). Temperature dependence of mu_h implies metallic conduction without ionized impurity scattering between 20 K and 250 K. Sheet hole density for a Fermi sphere n_S=2.8x10^11 /cm2 agrees well with 3.0x10^11 /cm2 of Hall measurements. A 6,500% magnetoresistance at 7 T accompanies Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations visible even at 15 K. These imply single-band conduction of holes with small effective mass in the in-plane directions, invoking a 2D hole gas (2DHG) picture that allotropic cross-D heterointerface between 2D GeH and 3D Ge harbors 2D-confined high-mobility holes. Even without elaborate heteroepitaxy and modulation doping, allotropic cross-D heterostructures pave the way toward facile 2DHG creation."

Using the GPU acceleration, the implementation achieves about fivefold speed compared to our previous CPU workflow, while yielding comparable outcomes. In addition, we introduce the optimization strategy that alternatively performs optimization on the direct and latent crystal representations. This dual-level relaxation approach can effectively overcome local barrier defined by different objective gradients, thus increasing the success rate of generating complex structures satisfying the targe local environments. This framework can be extended to systems consisting of multi-components and multi-environments, providing a scalable route to generate material structures with the target local environment."

We cast 10-day ahead correlation prediction in Fisher-z space and train a Temporal-Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (THGNN) to predict residual deviations from a rolling historical baseline. The architecture combines a Transformer-based temporal encoder, which captures non-stationary, complex, temporal dependencies, with an edge-aware graph attention network that propagates cross-asset information over the equity network. Inputs span daily returns, technicals, sector structure, previous correlations, and macro signals, enabling regime-aware forecasts and attention-based feature and neighbor importance to provide interpretability. Out-of-sample results from 2019-2024 show that the proposed model meaningfully reduces correlation forecasting error relative to rolling-window estimates. When integrated into a graph-based clustering framework, forward-looking correlations produce adaptable and economically meaningfully baskets, particularly during periods of market stress. These findings suggest that improvements in correlation forecasts translate into meaningful gains during portfolio construction tasks."

    "abstract": "As wireless networks progress toward sixthgeneration (6G), understanding the spatial distribution of directional beam coverage becomes increasingly important for beam management and link optimization. Multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) beam map provides such spatial awareness, yet accurate construction under sparse measurements remains difficult due to incomplete spatial coverage and strong angular variations. This paper presents a tensor decomposition approach for reconstructing MIMO beam map from limited measurements. By transforming measurements from a Cartesian coordinate system into a polar coordinate system, we uncover a matrix-vector outer-product structure associated with different propagation conditions. Specifically, we mathematically demonstrate that the matrix factor, representing beam-space gain, exhibits an intrinsic Toeplitz structure due to the shift-invariant nature of array responses, and the vector factor captures distance-dependent attenuation. Leveraging these structural priors, we formulate a regularized tensor decomposition problem to jointly reconstruct line-of-sight (LOS), reflection, and obstruction propagation conditions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency, achieving a normalized mean square error (NMSE) reduction of over 20% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, even under sparse sampling regimes."

We rigorously define the temporal dynamics using Quantum Channels (CPTP maps). Crucially, we detail a parameterization strategy based on the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, ensuring the learned dynamics remain physically valid (CPTP) by construction.

Under minimal integrability and boundedness assumptions on the graphon, we establish distributional limits for simple, well-separated eigenvalues of the associated integral operator. We show that a sharp dichotomy governs the asymptotic behavior. In the non-degenerate regime, the properly normalized empirical eigenvalue satisfies a central limit theorem with an explicit variance, whereas in the degenerate regime, the leading fluctuations vanish and the centered eigenvalue converges to an explicit weighted chi-square limit determined by the operator spectrum. Our analysis requires no smoothness or Lipschitz-type assumptions on the graphon. While earlier work under comparable integrability conditions established operator convergence and eigenspace consistency, the present results characterize the full fluctuation behavior of individual eigenvalues, thereby extending eigenvalue fluctuation theory beyond regimes accessible through operator convergence alone."

Here, we report magnon transport and its emergent anisotropic nature in BiFeO$_3$ layers confined between ultrathin layers of the antiferromagnet LaFeO$_3$. Due to the confined state, BiFeO$_3$ serves as an efficient magnon transmission channel as well as a magnetoelectric knob by which to control the stack by means of an electric field. We discuss the mechanism of the anisotropic spin transport based on the interaction between the antiferromagnetic order and the electric field. This allows us to manipulate and amplify the spin transport in such a confined geometry. Furthermore, lower crystal symmetric and suppression of the spin cycloid in ultrathin BiFeO$_3$ stabilizes a non-trivial antiferromagnetic state exhibiting symmetry-protected spin-split bands that provide the non-trivial sign inversion of the spin current, which is a characteristic of an altermagnet. This work provides an understanding of the anisotropic spin transport in complex antiferromagnetic heterostructures where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist, paving the way for a new route to realize electric-field control of a novel state of magnetism."

We show that our best model is capable of playing a variety of 3D video games at a level competitive with human play. We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale. We first show in a simple toy problem that, for some types of causal reasoning, increasing both the amount of training data and the depth of the network results in the model learning a more causal policy. We then systematically study how causality varies with the number of parameters (and depth) and training steps in scaled models of up to 1.2 billion parameters, and we find similar scaling results to what we observe in the toy problem."

    "abstract": "Since their initial standardizations in the 1930s and 1950s, the so-called four-point and three-point bending tests on unnotched beams have been embraced by practitioners as two popular methods to indirectly measure the tensile strength of concrete, ceramics, and other materials with a large compressive strength relative to their tensile strength. This is because of the ease that the tests afford in both the preparation of the specimen (a beam of rectangular cross section) and the application of the loads (simple supports pressing on the specimen). Yet, this practical advantage has to be tempered by the fact that the observations from both of these tests -- being \\emph{indirect} experiments in the sense that they involve \\emph{not} uniform uniaxial tension but non-uniform triaxial stress states throughout the specimen -- have to be appropriately interpreted to be useful. By making use of the phase-field fracture theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (2018), which has been recently established as a complete theory of fracture capable of accurately describing the nucleation and propagation of cracks in elastic brittle materials under arbitrary quasistatic loading conditions, the main objective of this paper is to carry out a thorough 3D quantitative analysis of when and where fracture nucleates and propagates in four-point and three-point bending tests and thereby establish how to appropriately interpret their results. As a corollary, the analysis provides an explanation for why four-point bending tests typically yield smaller flexural strengths than three-point bending tests, a source of constant headaches for practitioners who have been left to wonder which test -- if any -- would be more appropriate for their purposes."

However, in real-world interactions, acoustic-semantic conflict is common yet overlooked, where the emotion conveyed by tone contradicts the literal meaning of spoken words. We show that state-of-the-art SER models, including ASR-based, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches and Audio Language Models (ALMs), suffer performance degradation under such conflicts due to semantic bias or entangled acoustic-semantic representations. To address this, we propose the Fusion Acoustic-Semantic (FAS) framework, which explicitly disentangles acoustic and semantic pathways and bridges them through a lightweight, query-based attention module. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the Conflict in Acoustic-Semantic Emotion (CASE), the first dataset dominated by clear and interpretable acoustic-semantic conflicts in varied scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAS consistently outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and zero-shot settings. Notably, on the CASE benchmark, conventional SER models fail dramatically, while FAS sets a new SOTA with 59.38% accuracy. Our code and datasets is available at https://github.com/24DavidHuang/FAS."

    "abstract": "The explicit constraint force method (ECFM) was recently introduced as a novel formulation of the physics-informed solution reconstruction problem, and was subsequently extended to inverse problems. In both solution reconstruction and inverse problems, model parameters are estimated with the help of measurement data. In practice, experimentalists seek to design experiments such that the acquired data leads to the most robust recovery of the missing parameters in a subsequent inverse problem. While there are well-established techniques for designing experiments with standard approaches to the inverse problem, optimal experimental design (OED) has yet to be explored with the ECFM formulation. In this work, we investigate OED with a constraint force objective. First, we review traditional approaches to OED based on the Fisher information matrix, and propose an analogous formulation based on constraint forces. Next, we reflect on the different interpretations of the objective from standard and constraint force-based inverse problems. We then test our method on several example problems. These examples suggest that an experiment which is optimal in the sense of constraint forces tends to position measurements in the stiffest regions of the system. Because the responses -- and thus the measurements -- are small in these regions, this strategy is impractical in the presence of measurement noise and/or finite measurement precision. As such, our provisional conclusion is that ECFM is not a viable approach to OED."

This approach enables pseudo-label assignment even to samples that were previously excluded from training and facilitates contrastive learning that accounts for the confidence of both anchor and positive samples in a more principled manner. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves classification accuracy and achieves more stable learning performance even under low-label conditions."

However, conducting online A/B testing often presents significant challenges, including substantial economic costs, user experience degradation, and considerable time requirements. With the Large Language Models' powerful capacity, LLM-based agent shows great potential to replace traditional online A/B testing. Nonetheless, current agents fail to simulate the perception process and interaction patterns, due to the lack of real environments and visual perception capability. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal user agent for A/B testing (A/B Agent). Specifically, we construct a recommendation sandbox environment for A/B testing, enabling multimodal and multi-page interactions that align with real user behavior on online platforms. The designed agent leverages multimodal information perception, fine-grained user preferences, and integrates profiles, action memory retrieval, and a fatigue system to simulate complex human decision-making. We validated the potential of the agent as an alternative to traditional A/B testing from three perspectives: model, data, and features. Furthermore, we found that the data generated by A/B Agent can effectively enhance the capabilities of recommendation models.

The proposed technique converts the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to the frequency-domain 2D image and omits its high-frequency components, focusing on the exploration of gradual terrains such as planets and deserts. Unlike terrains with detailed structures such as artificial environments, high-frequency components contribute little to the representation of gradual terrains. Thus, this method is effective in compressing data size without significant degradation of the point cloud. We evaluated the method in terms of compression rate and accuracy using camera sequences of two terrains with different elevation profiles."

Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

While existing watermarking methods perform well in high-resource languages, their robustness in low-resource languages remains underexplored. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks. Experimental results show that layered watermarking improves post-RTT detection accuracy by 25-35%, achieving 40-50% accuracy, representing a 3$\\times$ to 4$\\times$ relative improvement over single-layer methods, at the cost of controlled semantic degradation. Our findings quantify the robustness-quality trade-off in multilingual watermarking and establish layered watermarking as a practical, training-free solution for low-resource languages such as Bangla.

In this study, using a simplified model for a two-layer fluid system, the applicability of the generalized kinetic equation (GKE) for such a situation is examined numerically. It is shown that the GKE can reproduce the appearance of a sharp peak in the surface wave spectrum due to double resonance, but it overestimates the growth of the peak, consequently failing to quantitatively describe the temporal evolution of the spectrum correctly, particularly near the double resonance point."

The proposed implementation is based on a novel elimination mechanism and a new combining approach that are efficiently blended to gain high performance. Our implementation results in enhanced parallelism and low contention when accessing the shared stack. Experiments show that the proposed stack implementation outperforms all existing concurrent stacks by up to 2X in most workloads. It is particularly efficient in systems supporting a large number of threads and in high contention scenarios."

    "abstract": "The design of reliable, valid, and diverse molecules is fundamental to modern drug discovery, as improved molecular generation supports efficient exploration of the chemical space for potential drug candidates and reduces the cost of early design efforts. Despite these needs, current chemical language models that generate molecules as SMILES strings are vulnerable to compounding token errors: many samples are unparseable or chemically implausible, and hard constraints meant to prevent failure can restrict exploration. To address this gap, we introduce TSSR, a Two-Stage, Swap-Reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) framework for character-level SMILES generation. Stage one rewards local token swaps that repair syntax, promoting transitions from invalid to parseable strings. Stage two provides chemistry-aware feedback from RDKit diagnostics, rewarding reductions in valence, aromaticity, and connectivity issues. The reward decomposes into interpretable terms (swap efficiency, error reduction, distance to validity), is model agnostic, and requires no task-specific labels or hand-crafted grammars. We evaluated TSSR on the MOSES benchmark using a GRU policy trained with PPO in both pure RL (P-RL) from random initialization and fine-tuning RL (F-RL) starting from a pretrained chemical language model, assessing 10,000 generated SMILES per run. In P-RL, TSSR significantly improves syntactic validity, chemical validity, and novelty. In F-RL, TSSR preserves drug-likeness and synthesizability while increasing validity and novelty. Token-level analysis shows that syntax edits and chemistry fixes act jointly to reduce RDKit detected errors. TSSR converts a sparse terminal objective into a denser and more interpretable reward, improving both syntactic and chemical quality without reducing diversity. TSSR is dataset-agnostic and can be adapted to various reinforcement learning approaches."

Extensive experiments on a 3D breast DCE-MRI dataset comprising 960 cases demonstrate that TokenSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance with 94.49\\% Dice and 89.61\\% IoU, while reducing GPU memory and inference latency by 64\\% and 68\\%, respectively. To verify the generalization capability, our evaluations on MSD cardiac and brain MRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that TokenSeg consistently delivers optimal performance across heterogeneous anatomical structures.

For a connected uniform hypergraph $H$, let $\\mathcal{A}(H)$ and $\\mathcal{L}(H)$ denote its adjacency tensor and Laplacian tensor, respectively.

While semantic transcription is well-studied, the precise localization of non-verbal events remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Current methods suffer from insufficient task definitions with limited category coverage and ambiguous temporal granularity. They also lack standardized evaluation frameworks, hindering the development of downstream applications. To bridge this gap, we first develop a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal events, with a new categorization into discrete (standalone) versus continuous (mixed with speech) types. Based on the refined taxonomy, we introduce WESR-Bench, an expert-annotated evaluation set (900+ utterances) with a novel position-aware protocol that disentangles ASR errors from event detection, enabling precise localization measurement for both discrete and continuous events. We also build a strong baseline by constructing a 1,700+ hour corpus, and train specialized models, surpassing both open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while preserving ASR quality. We anticipate that WESR will serve as a foundational resource for future research in modeling rich, real-world auditory scenes."

Despite numerous academic and practical efforts, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the definition and treatment of inertia service in market operations, particularly the specification of inertia variables and the separation between synchronous inertia (SI) from synchronous generators and virtual inertia (VI) from inverter-based resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a power-oriented (P-oriented) definition based on inertial response, which establishes conceptual consistency between SI and VI and makes the inertia service commensurable with other ASs. This definition explicitly incorporates both positive and negative inertial responses during frequency drop events. We then formulate a security-constrained economic dispatch framework based on this P-oriented definition and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through simulations. Case studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus system show that the proposed bidirectional service definition ensures price signals that reflect the economic value of inertial provision."

    "abstract": "Grids are a general representation for capturing regularly-spaced information, but since they are uniform in space, they cannot dynamically allocate resolution to regions with varying levels of detail. There has been some exploration of indirect grid adaptivity by replacing uniform grids with tetrahedral meshes or locally subdivided grids, as inversion-free deformation of grids is difficult. This work develops an inversion-free grid deformation method that optimizes differential weight to adaptively compress space. The method is the first to optimize grid vertices as differential elements using vertex-colorings, decomposing a dense input linear system into many independent sets of vertices which can be optimized concurrently. This method is then also extended to optimize UV meshes with convex boundaries. Experimentally, this differential representation leads to a smoother optimization manifold than updating extrinsic vertex coordinates. By optimizing each sets of vertices in a coloring separately, local injectivity checks are straightforward since the valid region for each vertex is fixed. This enables the use of optimizers such as Adam, as each vertex can be optimized independently of other vertices. We demonstrate the generality and efficacy of this approach through applications in isosurface extraction for inverse rendering, image compaction, and mesh parameterization."

    "abstract": "The environmental and target-related information inherently carried in wireless signals, such as channel state information (CSI), has brought increasing attention to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, it also raises pressing concerns about privacy leakage through eavesdropping. While existing efforts have attempted to mitigate this issue, they either fail to account for the needs of legitimate communication and sensing users or rely on hardware with high complexity and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose PrivISAC, a plug-and-play, low-cost solution that leverages RIS to protect user privacy while preserving ISAC performance. At the core of PrivISAC is a novel strategy in which each RIS row is assigned two distinct beamforming vectors, from which we deliberately construct a limited set of RIS configurations. During operation, exactly one configuration is randomly activated at each time slot to introduce additional perturbations, effectively masking sensitive sensing information from unauthorized eavesdroppers. To jointly ensure privacy protection and communication performance, we design the two vectors such that their responses remain nearly identical in the communication direction, thereby preserving stable, high-throughput transmission, while exhibiting pronounced differences in the sensing direction, which introduces sufficient perturbations to thwart eavesdroppers. Additionally, to enable legitimate sensing under such randomized configurations, we introduce a time-domain masking and demasking method that allows the authorized receiver to associate each CSI sample with its underlying configuration and eliminate configuration-induced discrepancies, thereby recovering valid CSI. We implement PrivISAC on commodity wireless devices and experiment results show that PrivISAC provides strong privacy protection while preserving high-quality legitimate ISAC."

    "abstract": "Detection systems that utilize machine learning are progressively implemented at Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to help an analyst to filter through high volumes of security alerts. Practically, such systems tend to reveal probabilistic results or confidence scores which are ill-calibrated and hard to read when under pressure. Qualitative and survey based studies of SOC practice done before reveal that poor alert quality and alert overload greatly augment the burden on the analyst, especially when tool outputs are not coherent with decision requirements, or signal noise. One of the most significant limitations is that model confidence is usually shown without expressing that there are asymmetric costs in decision making where false alarms are much less harmful than missed attacks. The present paper presents a decision-sensitive trust signal correspondence scheme of SOC alert triage. The framework combines confidence that has been calibrated, lightweight uncertainty cues, and cost-sensitive decision thresholds into coherent decision-support layer, instead of making changes to detection models. To enhance probabilistic consistency, the calibration is done using the known post-hoc methods and the uncertainty cues give conservative protection in situations where model certainty is low. To measure the model-independent performance of the suggested model, we apply the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifiers to the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection benchmark. According to simulation findings, false negatives are greatly amplified by the presence of misaligned displays of confidence, whereas cost weighted loss decreases by orders of magnitude between models with decision aligned trust signals. Lastly, we describe a human-in-the-loop study plan that would allow empirically assessing the decision-making of the analysts with aligned and misaligned trust interfaces."

Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies.

Our pressure gap condition is sharp in the class of potentials we consider. In the family of geometric potentials, our approach gives a simple new proof of uniqueness of equilibrium states up to the phase transition that occurs at the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set. For Hölder potentials, we show that our equilibrium state has positive entropy. This shows a posteriori that our pressure gap is equivalent to the a priori stronger condition that the potential is hyperbolic and this yields strong statistical properties for the equilibrium state."

Each device combines a germanium photodetector with a micro-ring modulator (MRM). The converters exhibit reconfigurable nonlinear transfer functions and measurable on-chip RF OEO gain. The RF OEO gain scales linearly with the MRM bias power, with slopes of 0.10 mW^-1 (load-resistor of 10 kΩ) and 1.4 mW^-1 (current-injection), enabling a gain > 1 region at practical bias powers (~10 mW and ~1 mW, respectively). Eye diagrams confirm clear openings up to 4 Gb/s for a high-speed load-resistor variant with a 500-Ω load. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a monolithically integrated, foundry-fabricated silicon-photonic load-resistor type OEO converter exhibiting reconfigurable nonlinear transfer and on-chip RF OEO gain. In the carrier-injection device, the activation slope exceeds unity, yielding 3.9 dB extinction-ratio regeneration. Short-pulse measurements yield 3-dB bandwidths of 1.49 GHz, 160 MHz (load-resistor of 500 Ω and 10 kΩ), and 76 MHz (current-injection), consistent with the RF data. Energy analysis shows an energy-bandwidth trade-off (RC-limited for load-resistor vs. lifetime-limited for injection) and outline routes to sub-pJ/bit operation via reduced capacitance and improved EO efficiency.

In this paper, we present a systematic analysis to search for 88 bright GRBs that include a total of 129 pulses observed by Fermi/GBM with redshift measured, and extract the spectra of each pulse with Band function (Band), cutoff power-law (CPL), blackbody (BB), non-dissipative photospheric (NDP), Band+BB, as well as CPL+BB. We find that 80 pulses, 35 pulses, and 14 pulses present purely non-thermal, hybrid, and thermal spectra, respectively. By focusing on those 80 pulses with purely non-thermal spectra, one can estimate the lower limits of magnetization factor ($σ$) via suppressing the pseudo-thermal component. It is found that 30 pulses in 21 GRBs are the lower limit of $σ>5$ at the photosphere by adopting $R_{0}=10^{10}$ cm. It suggests that at least the outflow of those GRB jets with high $σ$ is dominated by Poynting-flux. On the other hand, we also perform the light curve fitting with a fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) model for 15 bright GRBs with a high magnetization factor in our sample, and find that a correlation between pulse width ($w$) and energy of 13 GRBs really exists in their energy-resolved light curves. It is also a piece of independent evidence for those GRBs with a high value $σ$ to support the origin of the Poynting flux outflow."

Identifying such models is challenging in practice, often requiring iterative checking and revision through trial and error. To this end, we propose meta-probabilistic modeling (MPM), a meta-learning algorithm that learns generative model structure directly from multiple related datasets. MPM uses a hierarchical architecture where global model specifications are shared across datasets while local parameters remain dataset-specific. For learning and inference, we propose a tractable VAE-inspired surrogate objective, and optimize it through bi-level optimization: local variables are updated analytically via coordinate ascent, while global parameters are trained with gradient-based methods. We evaluate MPM on object-centric image modeling and sequential text modeling, demonstrating that it adapts generative models to data while recovering meaningful latent representations."

    "abstract": "Noise-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been commonly addressed by applying speech enhancement (SE) at the waveform level before recognition. However, speech-level enhancement does not always translate into consistent recognition improvements due to residual distortions and mismatches with the latent space of the ASR encoder. In this letter, we introduce a complementary strategy termed latent-level enhancement, where distorted representations are refined during ASR inference. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Flow Matching Refinement module (FM-Refiner) that operates on the output latents of a pretrained CTC-based ASR encoder. Trained to map imperfect latents-either directly from noisy inputs or from enhanced-but-imperfect speech-toward their clean counterparts, the FM-Refiner is applied only at inference, without fine-tuning ASR parameters. Experiments show that FM-Refiner consistently reduces word error rate, both when directly applied to noisy inputs and when combined with conventional SE front-ends. These results demonstrate that latent-level refinement via flow matching provides a lightweight and effective complement to existing SE approaches for robust ASR."

    "abstract": "Using large language models (LLMs) to predict relevance judgments has shown promising results. Most studies treat this task as a distinct research line, e.g., focusing on prompt design for predicting relevance labels given a query and passage. However, predicting relevance judgments is essentially a form of relevance prediction, a problem extensively studied in tasks such as re-ranking. Despite this potential overlap, little research has explored reusing or adapting established re-ranking methods to predict relevance judgments, leading to potential resource waste and redundant development. To bridge this gap, we reproduce re-rankers in a re-ranker-as-relevance-judge setup. We design two adaptation strategies: (i) using binary tokens (e.g., \"true\" and \"false\") generated by a re-ranker as direct judgments, and (ii) converting continuous re-ranking scores into binary labels via thresholding. We perform extensive experiments on TREC-DL 2019 to 2023 with 8 re-rankers from 3 families, ranging from 220M to 32B, and analyse the evaluation bias exhibited by re-ranker-based judges. Results show that re-ranker-based relevance judges, under both strategies, can outperform UMBRELA, a state-of-the-art LLM-based relevance judge, in around 40% to 50% of the cases; they also exhibit strong self-preference towards their own and same-family re-rankers, as well as cross-family bias."

The energy gap of ferroelectric compounds and its adjustment by compositional variation has particularly attracted attention in recent years due to potential application in energy conversion and/or catalytic devices. It is demonstrated that it is necessary to distinguish between the fundamental gap, $E_{\\rm g}^{0}$, the optical gap, $E_{\\rm g}^{\\rm opt}$, and the transport gap, $E_{\\rm g}^{\\rm tr}$, of ferroelectrics, which can differ significantly. The situation is comparable to those in organic semiconductors and emerges from the presence of localized charges. The fundamental gap is a ground state property, i.e.\\ the energy difference between the maximum of the fully occupied valence band and the minimum of the completely empty conduction band. In contrast, the optical and transport gaps are excited state properties involving localized (polaronic) electrons and/or holes at energies considerably different from the band edges. This work illustrates how the different energy gaps of ferroelectrics can be determined by combining optical measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature and oxygen partial pressure dependent electrical conductivity measurements. We determine fundamental gaps of $\\approx 4.5\\,$eV for both materials, optical gaps of $3.25-3.45\\,$eV/$3.5\\,$eV and electrical gaps of $\\approx 1.4\\,$eV/$3.3\\,$eV for Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$-BaTiO$_3$/NaNbO$_{3}$, respectively."

In this paper, we propose the concept of \\textbf{Character Identity}, a multidimensional construct that disentangles a character into two distinct layers: \\textbf{(1) Parametric Identity}, referring to character-specific knowledge encoded from the LLM's pre-training, and \\textbf{(2) Attributive Identity}, capturing fine-grained behavioral properties such as personality traits and moral values. To systematically investigate these layers, we construct a unified character profile schema and generate both Famous and Synthetic characters under identical structural constraints. Our evaluation across single-turn and multi-turn interactions reveals two critical phenomena. First, we identify \\textit{\"Fame Fades\"}: while famous characters hold a significant advantage in initial turns due to parametric knowledge, this edge rapidly vanishes as models prioritize accumulating conversational context over pre-trained priors. Second, we find that \\textit{\"Nature Remains\"}: while models robustly portray general personality traits regardless of polarity, RPA performance is highly sensitive to the valence of morality and interpersonal relationships. Our findings pinpoint negative social natures as the primary bottleneck in RPA fidelity, guiding future character construction and evaluation."

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, but the substantial memory overhead during backpropagation remains a critical bottleneck, especially as model scales grow. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization alleviates this issue by estimating gradients through forward passes and Gaussian sampling, avoiding the need for backpropagation. However, conventional ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation due to their reliance on random perturbations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance. We propose a simple plug-and-play method that incorporates prior-informed perturbations to refine gradient estimation. Our method dynamically computes a guiding vector from Gaussian samples, which directs perturbations toward more informative directions, significantly accelerating convergence compared to standard ZO approaches. We further investigate a greedy perturbation strategy to explore the impact of prior knowledge on gradient estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our gradient estimator achieves stronger alignment with the true gradient direction, enhancing optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments across LLMs of varying scales and architectures demonstrate that our proposed method could seamlessly integrate into existing optimization methods, delivering faster convergence and superior performance. Notably, on the OPT-13B model, our method outperforms traditional ZO optimization across all 11 benchmark tasks and surpasses gradient-based baselines on 9 out of 11 tasks, establishing a robust balance between efficiency and accuracy."

They have also found a new use case, as training and verification data for machine-learnt weather prediction (MLWP) models. Here we compare short-lead time (6h) forecasts from the MLWP model GraphCast against ERA5. In doing so, we identify a recurrent, spatially coherent error in 2m Temperature centred on the Ethiopian Highlands, that occurs predominantly at 0600 UTC. We show that these error events are not an error in the forecast from GraphCast, but are in fact an error in ERA5, and are also present in the ECMWF operational analysis. They arise from the 2D optimal interpolation procedure, when surface reports are assimilated that are temporally displaced compared to the background forecast. This produces spuriously warm analysis increments over Ethiopia on approximately 7\\% of dates at 0600 UTC across the reanalysis record. The spread from the ensemble of data assimilation partially flags these cases but is underdispersive. We assess the impact on GraphCast, which was trained on ERA5. While GraphCast can largely ignore these unphysical error events, a small systematic degradation in forecast skill over the region is observed. We discuss implications for using reanalysis as truth in machine learning training and verification, and recommend simple changes to reduce such artefacts in future analyses."

However, delay-based PUFs are vulnerable to Machine Learning Attacks (MLAs), undermining their assumed unclonability. There are no valid metrics for evaluating PUF MLA resistance, but empirical modelling experiments, which lack theoretical guarantees and are highly sensitive to advances in machine learning techniques. To address the fundamental gap between PUF designs and security qualifications, this work proposes a novel, formal, and unified framework for evaluating PUF security against modelling attacks by providing security lower bounds, independent of specific attack models or learning algorithms. We mathematically characterise the adversary's advantage in predicting responses to unseen challenges based solely on observed challenge-response pairs (CRPs), formulating the problem as a conditional probability estimation over the space of candidate PUFs. We present our analysis on previous \"broken\" PUFs, e.g., Arbiter PUFs, XOR PUFs, Feed-Forward PUFs, and for the first time compare their MLA resistance in a formal way. In addition, we evaluate the currently \"secure\" CT PUF, and show its security boundary. We demonstrate that the proposed approach systematically quantifies PUF resilience, captures subtle security differences, and provides actionable, theoretically grounded security guarantees for the practical deployment of PUFs."

These methods struggle to handle multiple item embeddings representing user history, reverting to textual semantics and neglecting richer collaborative information. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations. Preliminary results show that this design effectively leverages structured user-item interaction data, improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines, and offers a practical path for bridging traditional recommendation systems with modern LLMs."

However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \\textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools."

Under these conditions, over vertical ranges of several hundreds of meters water temperature varies only a few 0.0001degrC and the buoyancy frequency is smaller than the local inertial frequency. While such waters are characterized as 'quiescent', they are not stagnant and demonstrate regular bursts of turbulent overturns across scales larger than 10 m that are relevant for deep-sea life. As will be shown from a 3D mooring-array with nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature 'T-'sensors, consecutive NH conditions can last up to a fortnight, before stratified waters are advected over the array. At the site, NH conditions occur about 60% of the time. The majority of NH periods is governed by convection turbulence that is driven by geothermal heating from below. The associated turbulence dissipation rate, which is calculated from Ellison scales after precise band-pass filtering, compares with historic geophysical heat-flux measurements. Convection turbulence leads to buoyancy-driven scaling of spectra, not only of temperature in the turbulence range, but also suggesting extensions across the internal-wave band into sub-mesoscales, and (limited observations of) kinetic energy and waterflow differences. Such spectra are found to be uniform over the 124-m vertical T-sensor range above the flat seafloor. Small spectral deviations are observed when very weakly stratified waters are advected sideways or from above, whereby turbulence levels increase by about 30%. Movies show the alternation between calm periods, turbulent clouds passing, and geothermal-heat flares of various sizes."

These result in a mean buoyancy frequency of N = (1.5-2)f, where f denotes the inertial frequency. Although the stability values are one order of magnitude smaller than found in the ocean, they govern a dynamical deep sea as demonstrated using observations from a 3D mooring-array equipped with nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature sensors. SW-conditions can last up to a fortnight, before waters become near-homogeneous, and occur about 40% of the time, slightly more often in winter than in summer. Under SW, up to 60 m above seafloor is dominated by convection turbulence that is partially driven by geothermal heating 'GH' suppressed by stratification above. The upper-half of the array shows dominant shear turbulence driven by two sources. Interfacial internal waves generate weakly-nonlinear, resonant parametric instabilities that, upon breaking, provide mean turbulence dissipation rates of about one-third of that via general GH. It is about equal to open-ocean values away from boundaries and may represent the dominant source of turbulence there. Like GH, the observed turbulence is local up- and down-going. Tenfold larger mean dissipation rates are observed when slanted convection drives turbulent overturns >10 m and unstable clouds are advected with the mean flow. It confirms theoretical marginal stability analyses, previous vertical waterflow observations, and suggests a relationship between turbulence and sub-mesoscale eddies across the internal wave band.

We consider two types of centered fields, obtained by subtracting either the value at the North Pole or the spherical average.

To address this gap, we explore incentive mechanism design for FL with network effects and application-specific requirements of model performance. We develop a theoretical model to quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation, revealing the non-monotonic nature of such effects. Based on these insights, we propose a Model Trading and Sharing (MoTS) framework, which enables clients to obtain FL models through either participation or purchase. To further address clients' strategic behaviors, we design a Social Welfare maximization with Application-aware and Network effects (SWAN) mechanism, exploiting model customer payments for incentivization. Experimental results on a hardware prototype demonstrate that our SWAN mechanism outperforms existing FL mechanisms, improving social welfare by up to $352.42\\%$ and reducing extra incentive costs by $93.07\\%$."

We employed an age-structured approach, dividing the population into juvenile, adult, and elderly groups, to capture the disease's transmission dynamics across diverse demographic groups. The model incorporates a Holling-type incidence function, which accounts for the saturation effect of transmission at high prevalence levels, and applies Bayesian inference to estimate key epidemiological parameters, including transmission rates, recovery rates, and mortality rates. The study further explores cluster analysis to identify regional clusters within India based on the similarities in chickenpox transmission dynamics, using criteria like incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates. We perform K-means clustering to uncover three distinct epidemiological regimes, which vary in terms of outbreak potential and age-specific dynamics. The findings highlight juveniles as the primary drivers of transmission, while the elderly face a disproportionately high mortality burden. Our results underscore the importance of age-targeted interventions and suggest that regional heterogeneity should be considered in public health strategies for disease control. The model offers a transparent, reproducible framework for understanding long-term transmission dynamics and supports evidence-based planning for chickenpox control in India. The practical utility of the model is further validated through a simulation study."

This condition is not compatible with the simultaneous fulfillment of Hayward's unified gravitational first law and the fundamental thermodynamic equation of the apparent horizon. To solve this problem, we introduce an alternative formulation in which the cosmological horizon is modeled as a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system. We apply this approach to the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe under quantum gravity corrections encoded by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), promote the deformation parameter to a thermodynamic variable, and obtain a consistent thermodynamic description without relying on the usual pressure-volume interpretation. Using Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we show that fluctuations of the GUP parameter can induce phase transitions closely resembling those of black hole configurations. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the behavior of the GTD scalar curvature near the phase transition point, where we find a scaling behavior characterized by the critical exponent close to 1, independently of the dimension of the equilibrium space. This reveals that quantum gravity corrections not only modify the thermodynamic consistency of cosmological models but also strengthen the notion of thermodynamic universality across gravitational systems. Our findings confirm GTD as a powerful geometric tool to unveil the emergent thermodynamic microstructure of spacetime."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a computational framework for modeling wave propagation in geometrically linear elastic materials characterized by algebraically nonlinear constitutive relations. We derive a specific form of the nonlinear wave equation in which the nonlinearity explicitly appears in the time-derivative terms that govern the evolution of the mechanical fields. The numerical solution is established using a fully discrete formulation that combines the standard finite element method for spatial discretization with the implicit Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT)-$α$ scheme for time integration. To address the nonlinear nature of the discrete system, we employ Newton's method to iteratively solve the linearized equations at each time step. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework are rigorously verified through convergence analyses, which demonstrate optimal convergence rates in both space and time. Furthermore, a detailed parametric study is conducted to elucidate the influence of the model's constitutive parameters. The results reveal that the magnitude parameter of the stress-dependent variation in wave speed leads to wavefront steepening and the formation of shock discontinuities. Conversely, the exponent parameter acts as a nonlinearity filter; high values suppress nonlinear effects in small-strain regimes, whereas low values allow significant dispersive behavior. This work provides a validated tool for analyzing shock formation in advanced nonlinear materials."

We show that the axisymmetric solution must be trivial if its local $L^\\infty$-norm grows mildly as the radius $R$ grows. Also, a bounded general solution $u$ must be trivial if $ru^r$ is bounded. The proof is inspired by the work of Bang, Gui, Wang, and Xie [J. Fluid Mech. 1005 (2025)] for the Navier-Stokes equations, and the key point is to establish a Saint-Venant type estimate that characterizes the growth of the local Dirichlet integral of nontrivial solutions. One new ingredient is the estimate of the constant in Korn's inequality over different domains."

Due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns, organizations often prefer on-premise deployment of LLMs. The ThaiLLM initiative aims to enhance Thai language capabilities in open-LLMs, enabling Thai industry to leverage advanced language models. However, organizations often face a trade-off between deploying multiple specialized models versus the prohibitive expense of training a single multi-capability model. To address this, we explore model merging as a resource-efficient alternative for developing high-performance, multi-capability LLMs. We present results from two key experiments: first, merging Qwen-8B with ThaiLLM-8B demonstrates how ThaiLLM-8B enhances Thai general capabilities, showing an uplift of M3 and M6 O-NET exams over the general instruction-following Qwen-8B. Second, we merge Qwen-8B with both ThaiLLM-8B and THaLLE-CFA-8B. This combination results in further improvements in performance across both general and financial domains, by demonstrating an uplift in both M3 and M6 O-NET, Flare-CFA, and Thai-IC benchmarks. The report showcases the viability of model merging for efficiently creating multi-capability LLMs."

Despite efforts to achieve high validity in VR studies, haptic sensation, an essential sensory modality for perception and a critical factor in enhancing VR realism, is often absent from these experiments. Studying an interactive robot help-seeking scenario, we used a VR simulation with haptic gloves that provide highly realistic tactile and force feedback to examine the effects of haptic sensation on VR-based HRI. We compared participants' sense of presence and their assessments of the robot to a traditional setup using hand controllers. Our results indicate that haptic sensation enhanced participants' social and self-presence in VR and fostered more diverse and natural bodily engagement. Additionally, haptic sensations significantly influenced participants' affective-related perceptions of the robot. Our study provides insights to guide HRI researchers in building VR-based simulations that better align with their study contexts and objectives."

Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $α$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 Å, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 Å--1 mm for both $α$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $α$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars."

Despite efforts to quantify APT's spatial resolution, misunderstanding remain regarding its true spatial performance. If the depth resolution was once reported to be 20 pm, quoting this value outside of its specific context is misleading and should be avoided. The resolution achievable in pure metals, at one specific location within one reconstructed dataset, does not generally apply across materials or analysis conditions, or even throughout a single tomographic reconstruction. Here, we review various efforts at defining and measuring the spatial resolution in the study of single phase and single element materials - i.e. pure metals - in field-ion microscopy (FIM) and APT. We also report on the degradation of the resolution arising from ion optical devices used to improve the mass-resolution. We aim to offer some perspective as to how reported resolutions may be or may not be of any relevance to most of the materials characterisation efforts by APT, including cases of precipitates in a matrix that emphasise the need to consider an effective resolution. Finally, we discuss concepts to improve the spatial accuracy of the technique in a relatively distant future."

The experiment reveals an intriguing phenomenon: the learned features of SPT align well with physical dispersion relations, where the contribution-score map of selected points is concentrated along dispersion curves. Compared to conventional vision networks that process image sequences and full spectra, SPT demonstrates superior performance in Hs regression while consuming significantly fewer computational resources. On a consumer-grade GPU, SPT completes the training of regression model for 1080 sea clutter image sequences within 4 minutes, showcasing its potential to reduce deployment costs for radar wave-measuring systems.

However, when multiple views share a source, an update on one view may affect the others, making it hard to maintain correspondence while preserving the user's update, especially when multiple views are changed at once. Ensuring these properties within a compositional framework is even more challenging. In this paper, we propose partial-state lenses, which allow source and view states to be partially specified to precisely represent the user's update intentions. These intentions are partially ordered, providing clear semantics for merging intentions of updates coming from multiple views and a refined notion of update preservation compatible with this merging. We formalize partial-state lenses, together with partial-specifiedness-aware well-behavedness that supports compositional reasoning and ensures update preservation. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed system through examples."

    "abstract": "In the Material Point Method (MPM), accurately imposing Neumann-type thermal boundary conditions, particularly convective heat flux boundaries, remains a significant challenge due to the inherent nonconformity between complex evolving material boundaries and the fixed background grid. This paper introduces a novel Virtual Heat Flux Method (VHFM) to overcome this limitation. The core idea is to construct a virtual flux field on an auxiliary domain surrounding the physical boundary, which exactly satisfies the prescribed boundary condition. This transforms the surface integral in the weak form into an equivalent, and easily computed, volumetric integral. Consequently, VHFM eliminates the need for explicit boundary tracking, specialized boundary particles, or complex surface reconstruction. A unified formulation is presented, demonstrating the method's straightforward extension to general scalar, vector, and tensor Neumann conditions. The accuracy, robustness, and convergence of VHFM are rigorously validated through a series of numerical benchmarks, including 1D transient analysis, 2D and 3D curved boundaries, and problems with large rotations and complex moving geometries. The results show that VHFM achieves accuracy comparable to conforming node-based imposition and significantly outperforms conventional particle-based approaches. Its simplicity, computational efficiency, and robustness make it an attractive solution for integrating accurate thermal boundary conditions into thermo-mechanical and other multiphysics MPM frameworks."

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has made significant strides in overcoming key limitations of large language models, such as hallucination, lack of contextual grounding, and issues with transparency. However, traditional RAG systems consist of three interconnected neural components - the retriever, re-ranker, and generator - whose internal reasoning processes remain opaque. This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows. Preliminary results from mental health risk assessment tasks indicate that this neurosymbolic approach enhances both transparency and overall performance"

In this paper, we propose RepMD, an ever-shifting harmful meme detection method based on the design concept reproduction. We first refer to the attack tree to define the Design Concept Graph (DCG), which describes steps that people may take to design a harmful meme. Then, we derive the DCG from historical memes with design step reproduction and graph pruning. Finally, we use DCG to guide the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to detect harmful memes. The evaluation results show that RepMD achieves the highest accuracy with 81.1% and has slight accuracy decreases when generalized to type-shifting and temporal-evolving memes. Human evaluation shows that RepMD can improve the efficiency of human discovery on harmful memes, with 15$\\sim$30 seconds per meme."

This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience.

ROS introduces a Hierarchical Spatial Semantic ID (SID) that discretizes coarse-to-fine locality and POI semantics into compositional tokens, and endows LLM with a three-stage Mobility Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that models user personality, constructs an intent-aligned candidate space, and performs locality informed pruning. We further align the model with real world geography via spatial-guided Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on three widely used location-based social network (LBSN) datasets show that ROS achieves over 10% relative gains in hit rate over strongest LLM-based baselines and improves cross-city transfer, despite using a smaller backbone model."

This generates spatially localized individual spinons with high controllability. By applying time-dependent gauge fields, we realize adiabatic braiding of these spinons, as well as their dynamical evolution in a controllable manner. These results not only provide the first direct visualization of individual spinons localized in the bulk, but also point to new possibilities to simulate their confinement process. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our scenario in Rydberg atoms, which suggests an experimentally viable direction--gauge field engineering of correlated phenomena in excited states."

We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts. We demonstrate the methodology through an industrial pilot deployment in financial services. 4D-ARE addresses what agents should reason about, complementing runtime frameworks that address how. We hypothesize systematic specification amplifies the power of these foundational advances.

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception (CP) is a critical technology in applications like autonomous driving and smart cities. It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations."

Recent work on LLM-based MASs has mainly focused on architecture design, such as role assignment and workflow orchestration. In contrast, this paper targets the interaction process itself, aiming to improve agents' communication efficiency by helping them convey their intended meaning more effectively through language. To this end, we propose LinguaGame, a linguistically-grounded game-theoretic paradigm for multi-agent dialogue generation. Our approach models dialogue as a signalling game over communicative intents and strategies, solved with a training-free equilibrium approximation algorithm for inference-time decision adjustment. Unlike prior game-theoretic MASs, whose game designs are often tightly coupled with task-specific objectives, our framework relies on linguistically informed reasoning with minimal task-specific coupling. Specifically, it treats dialogue as intentional and strategic communication, requiring agents to infer what others aim to achieve (intents) and how they pursue those goals (strategies). We evaluate our framework in simulated courtroom proceedings and debates, with human expert assessments showing significant gains in communication efficiency."

In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds. This work is a first stepping stone towards high-fidelity extrapolation in both space and time of phase-field simulation for LMD."

A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning. We apply this general backbone to various downstream tasks at the instance level, element level, and solving state level. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmarks show consistent improvements of our approach over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting attention-based neural architectures as a powerful foundation for learning-enhanced mixed-integer linear optimization."

    "abstract": "Generating accurate circuit schematics from high-level natural language descriptions remains a persistent challenge in electronics design, as large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate in granular details, violate electrical constraints, and produce non-machine-readable outputs. We present CircuitLM, a novel multi-agent LLM-aided circuit design pipeline that translates user prompts into structured, visually interpretable CircuitJSON schematics through five sequential stages: (i) LLM-based component identification, (ii) canonical pinout retrieval, (iii) chain-of-thought reasoning by an electronics expert agent, (iv) JSON schematic synthesis, and (v) force-directed SVG visualization. Anchored by a curated, embedding-powered component knowledge base. While LLMs often violate electrical constraints, CircuitLM bridges this gap by grounding generation in a verified and dynamically extensible component database, initially comprising 50 components. To ensure safety, we incorporate a hybrid evaluation framework, namely Dual-Metric Circuit Validation (DMCV), validated against human-expert assessments, which achieves high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs. We evaluate the system on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs and introduce DMCV to assess both structural and electrical validity. This work bridges natural language input to deployable hardware designs, enabling reliable circuit prototyping by non-experts. Our code and data will be made public upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "Modern forest monitoring workflows increasingly benefit from the growing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery and advances in deep learning. Two persistent challenges in this context are accurate pixel-level change detection and meaningful semantic change captioning for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are being adapted for interactive data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. The proposed system builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we further introduce the Forest-Change dataset, which comprises bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated using a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves mIoU and BLEU-4 scores of 67.10% and 40.17% on the Forest-Change dataset, and 88.13% and 34.41% on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI benchmark for joint change detection and captioning. These results highlight the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and efficiency of forest change analysis.

By adding temporal priors across time steps, our method additionally performs joint estimation in both the spatial (arclength) and temporal domains, enabling full \\textit{spacetime} state estimation. Discretizing the arclength domain yields a factor graph representation of the continuum robot model, which can be exploited for fast batch sparse nonlinear optimization in the style of SLAM. The framework is general and applies to a broad class of continuum robots; as illustrative cases, we show (i) tendon-driven robots in simulation, where we demonstrate real-time kinematics with uncertainty, tip force sensing from position feedback, and distributed load estimation from backbone strain, and (ii) a surgical concentric tube robot in experiment, where we validate accurate kinematics and tip force estimation, highlighting potential for surgical palpation."

Our findings reveal how users' limited initiative and effectiveness in protecting their privacy could be associated with a missing or inaccurate understanding of how implicit data collection by third parties takes place on the web, and who collects the data.

We derive convergence of HFL framework and introduce two methods to exploit degrees of freedom (DoF) in HFL, which are (i) adaptive UE clustering via Jenks optimization and (ii) adaptive weight selection via a damped Newton method. Numerical results show that HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when both DoF are exploited."

Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals. By delivering this blueprint, we hope to give shape to an important but uncrystallized new domain of research - and, in doing so, incite necessary investment in it."

    "abstract": "Droplet impact phenomena are ubiquitous in both nature and industry. Existing studies of droplet impact have focused on the kinematics of droplet impact on flat surfaces, whereas research on cylindrical surfaces remains relatively limited, particularly from a force-based perspective. Here, droplet impact on cylindrical surfaces is studied by numerical simulation, with particular attention to the spreading behavior and impact force acting on the wall. In the deposition mode, a single peak appears in the impact force curve, which corresponds to the rapid transfer of the droplet's initial momentum. In the rebound mode, two distinct peaks are observed, and the second peak arises from the reaction force during the retraction process. Increasing the surface wettability causes the asymmetry coefficient, the ratio of the maximum spreading lengths in the azimuthal and axial directions of the cylinder, to first decrease and then gradually approach a constant, while the effect of the surface wettability on the initial impact force is negligible. As the Weber number We increases, the first dimensionless peak of the impact force $F_{p1}^{*}$ approaches a constant, and the relationship can be expressed as $F_{p1}^{*}=β_1+{β_2}{{We}^{-1}}$ (where ${β}_1$ and ${β}_2$ are constants). The dimensionless maximum spreading area, dimensionless maximum spreading length, dimensionless maximum spreading angle, and asymmetry coefficient all exhibit power-law relationships with the Weber and Ohnesorge numbers. Furthermore, an increase in the diameter ratio of the cylinder and the droplet leads to a reduction in the asymmetry coefficient and an increase in the first dimensionless peak of the impact force."

    "abstract": "Agents capable of reasoning and planning in the real world require the ability of predicting the consequences of their actions. While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world."

    "abstract": "Simulating the time dynamics of an observable under Hamiltonian evolution is one of the most promising candidates for quantum advantage as we do not expect efficient classical algorithms for this problem except in restricted settings. Here, we introduce such a setting by showing that Majorana Propagation, a simple algorithm combining Trotter steps and truncations, efficiently finds a low-degree approximation of the time-evolved observable as soon as such an approximation exists. This provides the first provable guarantee about Majorana Propagation for Hamiltonian evolution. As an application of this result, we prove that Majorana Propagation can efficiently simulate the time dynamics of any sparse quartic Hamiltonian up to time $t_{\\text{max}}(u)$ depending on the interaction strength $u$. For a time horizon $t \\leq t_{\\text{max}}(u)$, the runtime of the algorithm is $N^{O(\\log(t/\\varepsilon))}$ where $N$ is the number of Majorana modes and $\\varepsilon$ is the error measured in the normalized Frobenius norm. Importantly, in the limit of small $u$, $t_{\\text{max}}(u)$ goes to $+\\infty$, formalizing the intuition that the algorithm is accurate at all times when the Hamiltonian is quadratic."

While environmental drivers of mosquito oscillations have been extensively studied, the influence of spontaneous household decision-making on the dynamics of mosquito populations remains poorly understood. We introduce a game-theoretic model in which the fraction of households performing breeding site control evolves through imitation dynamics driven by perceived risks. Household behavior regulates the carrying capacity of the aquatic mosquito stage, creating a feedback between control actions and mosquito population growth. For a simplified model with constant payoffs, we characterize four locally stable equilibria, corresponding to full or no household control and the presence or absence of mosquito populations. When the perceived risk of not controlling breeding sites depends on mosquito prevalence, the system admits an additional equilibrium with partial household engagement. We derive conditions under which this equilibrium undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, yielding sustained oscillations arising solely from the interaction between mosquito abundance and household behavior. Numerical simulations and parameter explorations further describe the amplitude and phase properties of these oscillatory regimes."

We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented."

Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrelators reveal a rich and complex dynamical behavior that is obscured by the imbalance observable. By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols. Overall, our experimentally testable predictions highlight the necessity of a refined, site-resolved approach to fully understand the complexities of MBL and its connection to rare-region effects."

However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to acquire question-relevant context at inference time and hinders complex spatial reasoning. We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views. It then performs fine-grained view adjustment by interleaving iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions, obtaining new observations from the underlying 3D scene representation until sufficient context is gathered or a step budget is reached. We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56\\% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62\\% on Qwen3-VL-Flash. CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51\\% average improvement, peaking at +3.73\\% on Gemini-2.5-Flash. On ScanQA and SQA3D, CoV delivers strong performance (e.g., 116 CIDEr / 31.9 EM@1 on ScanQA and 51.1 EM@1 on SQA3D). Overall, these results suggest that question-aligned view selection coupled with open-view search is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for improving spatial reasoning in 3D EQA without additional training."

The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion. The developed framework enables quantitative access to more drastic analog cosmological scenarios with improved predictability in the ultraviolet regime that ultimately may lead to the observation of a scale-invariant cosmological power spectrum in the laboratory."

Among these, correlations between UV/optical and X-ray flux variations serve as a key diagnostics for understanding the physical connection between the accretion disk and the corona. In this work, we present the results of analysis of ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray flux variations in the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 1044. Simultaneous observations in the far-UV band (FUV: 1300$-$1800 Å) and the X-ray band (0.5$-$7 keV) obtained during 31 August $-$ 8 September 2018 with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and the Soft X-ray Telescope onboard \\textit{AstroSat} were used for this study. Significant flux variability was detected in both FUV and X-ray bands. The fractional root mean square variability amplitude ($F_{\\rm var}$) was found to be 0.036 $\\pm$ 0.001 in the FUV band and 0.384 $\\pm$ 0.004 in the X-ray band. To explore potential time lag between the two bands, cross-correlation analysis was performed using both the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) and just another vehicle for estimating lags in nuclei (JAVELIN) methods. Results from both approaches are consistent within 2$σ$ uncertainty, indicating that X-ray variations lead the FUV variations, with measured lags of 2.25$\\pm$0.05 days (ICCF) and $2.35_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ days (JAVELIN). This is the first detection of a time delay between UV and X-ray variations in Mrk 1044. The observed UV lag supports the disk reprocessing scenario, wherein X-ray emission from the corona irradiates the accretion disk, driving the observed UV variability."

    "abstract": "Boson stars have been extensively studied in classical gravity, but their quantum properties remain comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we compute the quantum scalar fields and stress tensor in boson star spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity. Divergences are regularized using Pauli-Villars fields, and accurate numerical results are obtained through spectral methods. Employing coherent states enables a direct comparison between the classical part of the stress tensor and the quantum fluctuation. Our results indicate that strong spacetime curvature is the primary source of large quantum effects. The renormalized quantum energy density is mostly positive but the radial pressure is negative, suggesting that classical boson star solutions require modification once quantum effects are included. Moreover, in regimes of large curvature, the quantum fluctuations can constitute a significant fraction of the total stress tensor. The methods developed here can be generalized to other compact objects and used to study their response to quantum corrections."

    "abstract": "Simulation studies are used to understand the properties of statistical methods. A key luxury in many simulation studies is knowledge of the true value (i.e. the estimand) being targeted. With this oracle knowledge in-hand, the researcher conducting the simulation study can assess across repeated realizations of the data how well a given method recovers the truth. In causal inference simulation studies, the truth is rarely a simple parameter of the statistical model chosen to generate the data. Instead, the estimand is often an average treatment effect, marginalized over the distribution of confounders and/or mediators. Luckily, these variables are often generated from common distributions such as the normal, uniform, exponential, or gamma. For all these distributions, Gaussian quadratures provide efficient and accurate calculation for integrands with integral kernels that stem from known probability density functions. We demonstrate through four applications how to use Gaussian quadrature to accurately and efficiently compute the true causal estimand. We also compare the pros and cons of Gauss-Hermite quadrature to Monte Carlo integration approaches, which we use as benchmarks. Overall, we demonstrate that the Gaussian quadrature is an accurate tool with negligible computation time, yet is underused for calculating the true causal estimands in simulation studies."

In particular, we identify the vanishing of a small orbit on the Fermi surface, associated with a quantum-oscillation frequency of 34 T. Furthermore, the different transitions are better resolved with acoustic modes of particular symmetry. Using a microscopic model adapted to the strongly correlated electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$, we describe our results by inspecting realistic electron-phonon couplings in reciprocal space for each acoustic mode. This shows how the $k$ selectivity of ultrasound experiments allows to investigate Fermi-surface reconstructions in strongly correlated electronic systems."

The Fermi arcs on the two different (0001) surface terminations have been associated with the set of Weyl points just above the Fermi energy (E$_F$). Here using first-principles calculations to explore the band crossings over the full Brillouin zone between the nominally highest valence and lowest conduction bands in $γ$-PtBi$_2$, we find a Weyl nodal loop (WNL) and multiple sets of Weyl points (WPs). The main difference between the two reported experimental structural parameters is the magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. While the WNL, bulk gap region and the set of Weyl points just above the E$_F$ are robust, the number and location of the other sets of WPs depend sensitively on the structural parameters with different magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. Besides calculating the 2D Fermi surface with Fermi arcs and quasi-particle interference (QPI) around the E$_F$ in good agreements with ARPES and experimental QPI, we also predict new Fermi arc features at higher energy."

This has catalyzed the transition to Agent-as-a-Judge, where agentic judges employ planning, tool-augmented verification, multi-agent collaboration, and persistent memory to enable more robust, verifiable, and nuanced evaluations. Despite the rapid proliferation of agentic evaluation systems, the field lacks a unified framework to navigate this shifting landscape. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey tracing this evolution.

Ultra-black materials achieve exceptional light attenuation but are often constrained by cost and mechanical fragility, motivating the evaluation of more robust and accessible alternatives. In this study, we employ a gonimetric measurement system to capture the isotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution function of a range of black materials, including the ultra-black reference Vantablack, commercially available alternatives such as Musou Black and black velvet, and standard matte black coatings. We analyze their reflectance characteristics in terms of diffuse and specular scattering, as well as total integrated scatter, to quantify angular-dependent reflection. In addition, we compare their perceptual appearance using physically based rendering driven by the measured BRDFs and a psychophysical evaluation of perceived darkness. Together, these analyses provide a comprehensive assessment of black materials that links reflectance properties to visual appearance and perceptual performance, enabling informed material selection for optical applications."

For a $G$-graded $K$-algebra $A$, we define the primeness property for graded central polynomials: for any graded polynomials $f$ and $g$ in disjoint sets of variables, if $fg$ is graded central, then both $f$ and $g$ are graded central. Let $A=\\bigoplus_{g\\in G} A_g$ be its decomposition into homogeneous components. Assume that for every $n$-tuple $(g_1,\\dots,g_n)$ in $G$, there exist $a_{i}\\in A_{g_{i}}$ with $a_1\\cdots a_n\\neq 0$, and that for each $g$,$h\\in G$ there exists a scalar $β(g,h)\\in K^{\\ast}$ such that $a_ga_h=β(g,h)a_ha_g$. Then the grading is regular, and minimal if no distinct $g$, $h\\in G$ satisfy $β(g,x)=β(h,x)$ for all $x\\in G$. We prove that $G$-graded regular algebras, including $M_n(K)$ with the Pauli grading, fail the primeness property. For matrices of orders $2$ and $3$, no nontrivial gradings satisfy primeness. Finally, for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded regular algebras, we use the known fact that minimal regular gradings satisfy the graded identities of the infinite-dimensional Grassmann algebra $E$ and contain a copy of $E$ to show that such algebras satisfy the primeness property in the ordinary sense. As a consequence, we show that minimality is not required for the regularity of the grading."

While existing work extensively addresses LLM steering for a single behavior, \\textit{compositional steering} -- i.e., steering LLMs simultaneously towards multiple behaviors -- remains an underexplored problem. In this work, we propose \\emph{compositional steering tokens} for multi-behavior steering. We first embed individual behaviors, expressed as natural language instructions, into dedicated tokens via self-distillation. Contrary to most prior work, which operates in the activation space, our behavior steers live in the space of input tokens, enabling more effective zero-shot composition. We then train a dedicated \\textit{composition token} on pairs of behaviors and show that it successfully captures the notion of composition: it generalizes well to \\textit{unseen} compositions, including those with unseen behaviors as well as those with an unseen \\textit{number} of behaviors. Our experiments across different LLM architectures show that steering tokens lead to superior multi-behavior control compared to competing approaches (instructions, activation steering, and LoRA merging). Moreover, we show that steering tokens complement natural language instructions, with their combination resulting in further gains."

However, standard ionisation vectors such as stellar UV, X-rays, Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) might not be efficient enough, as UV/X-rays are attenuated rapidly with depth, while GCRs are modulated. Turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection in disc atmospheric layers offers a physically motivated, in-situ source of energetic particles (EPs) that has never been considered. We quantify the ionisation and heating produced by EPs accelerated by turbulent reconnection, identify where they dominate over X-rays and GCRs, and determine energetic thresholds for their relevance. We provide scalable diagnostics tied to the local energy budget. We adopt a Fermi-like acceleration model with parameters linked to a turbulent reconnection geometry trigger by the magneto-rotational instability, yielding a steady-state energy distribution of the EP forming a power-law of index $p=2.5$. We propagate electrons and protons through the disc and compute primary and secondary ionisation and associated heating on a fiducial T Tauri disc model background. The non-thermal normalisation is set by the fraction of local viscous accretion energy dissipation channelled to EPs, parametrised by $κ$. For $κ\\gtrsim 0.4\\%$, EPs ionisation overpass standard sources like X-rays and GCRs in the disc atmosphere and intermediate/deep layers out to radii of a few tens of AU. Even at $κ\\sim 0.025\\%$, EPs contribute at the few-percent level, thus are chemically and dynamically relevant. EP-induced heating complements UV/X-ray heating in the atmosphere and persists deeper. These results identify EPs accelerated by turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection as a rather robust, disc-internal ionisation channel that should be included in thermo-chemical and dynamical models of protoplanetary discs."

This process, known as superradiance, leads to the exponential amplification of the field around a black hole or neutron star, while the spin of the central object is correspondingly depleted. The discovery of a highly spinning black hole could therefore be used to constrain the existence of light bosons such as axions in a particular range of masses. These constraints apply for very low non-gravitational couplings between the boson and the Standard Model, offering a powerful search strategy for new physics. However, care must be taken to include the more complex effects of the black hole's astrophysical environment. Conversely, stellar superradiance could allow us to probe additional non-gravitational interactions between a new boson at the stellar matter. In this article, I will discuss the current status and future directions of axion superradiance.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE.

    "abstract": "The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution."

    "abstract": "Equivariance is a powerful inductive bias in neural networks, improving generalisation and physical consistency. Recently, however, non-equivariant models have regained attention, due to their better runtime performance and imperfect symmetries that might arise in real-world applications. This has motivated the development of approximately equivariant models that strike a middle ground between respecting symmetries and fitting the data distribution. Existing approaches in this field usually apply sample-based regularisers which depend on data augmentation at training time, incurring a high sample complexity, in particular for continuous groups such as $SO(3)$. This work instead approaches approximate equivariance via a projection-based regulariser which leverages the orthogonal decomposition of linear layers into equivariant and non-equivariant components. In contrast to existing methods, this penalises non-equivariance at an operator level across the full group orbit, rather than point-wise. We present a mathematical framework for computing the non-equivariance penalty exactly and efficiently in both the spatial and spectral domain. In our experiments, our method consistently outperforms prior approximate equivariance approaches in both model performance and efficiency, achieving substantial runtime gains over sample-based regularisers."

To this end, we formulate a tailored objective function that minimizes prediction entropy to yield new prompt weights, utilizing low-entropy as a proxy for high confidence. Our approach can be applied to individual samples or a batch of audio samples, requiring no additional labels and incurring negligible computational overhead. Experiments on five audio classification datasets covering environmental, urban, and vocal sounds, demonstrate consistent gains compared to classical prompt ensembling methods in a zero-shot setting, with accuracy improvements 5-times larger across the whole benchmark."

    "abstract": "A sample of 278 triple systems with outer separations under 300 au and resolved inner pairs is studied, focusing on the mutual alignment between inner and outer orbits. The degree of alignment increases with (i) decreasing outer separation, (ii) decreasing ratio of outer and inner separations, (iii) decreasing mass of the inner primary component, and (iv) increasing inner mass ratio. There is no dependence on the outer mass ratio. The average mutual inclination is ~40deg for the full sample and ~10deg for 38 triples with primary components less massive than 1 solar and outer separations below 50 au. Inner eccentricities in aligned triples are smaller compared to misaligned ones. In another sample of 371 hierarchies with known outer orbits and inner eclipsing subsystems, only 22% show mutual alignment within 20deg, while the rest are aligned randomly. These findings match qualitatively current understanding of the formation of hierarchical systems, where the N-body dynamics dominates at large scales, while the accretion and migration shape systems closer than $\\sim$100 au. Fragmentation of isolated cores apparently produces approximately aligned low-mass hierarchies."

    "abstract": "Accurate gas temperature ($T_{\\rm Gas}$) determination in microplasmas is critical for optimizing their applications, yet isolated diagnostic approaches may yield misleading results, especially under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Here, high resolution rotational spectra of N$_2$(C), OH(A), NH(A) and NO(A), generated in the plasma jet of a DC Ar/N$_2$ microhollow cathode discharge (MHCD), are recorded and their associated rotational temperatures ($T_{\\rm rot}$) are cross compared. A detailed experimental analysis and robust fitting of the rotational spectra are performed, achieving a reliable estimation of $T_{\\rm Gas}$. The dominant formation mechanisms of these species and their corresponding impact on rotational population distributions are also interrogated. Particularly, our findings indicate that the $T_{\\rm rot}$of N$_2$(C) is significantly influenced by energy transfers from argon metastables (Ar$^m$) and spectral interference from NH(A). This makes it unreliable as a thermometric probe in Ar-rich MHCD, unless complex analyses are employed. In contrast, OH(A) rotational population distribution appears to be less sensitive to Ar-induced perturbations across various discharge currents and pressures, providing more straightforward results. For all molecules considered, this study reveals the conditions under which all the measured $T_{\\rm rot}$ can be reliably considered to be in equilibrium with $T_{\\rm Gas}$. This highlights the importance of crossvalidating multiple thermometric probes and investigating relevant excitation kinetics when measuring $T_{\\rm rot}$ in reactive microplasmas."

    "abstract": "This study experimentally and numerically investigates the dynamics of a high-speed liquid jet generated from the interaction of two tandem cavitation bubbles, termed bubble 1 and bubble 2, depending on their generation sequence. In our experiments, two near-identical, highly-energized cavitation bubbles were generated using an underwater electric discharge method, and their transient interactions were captured using a high-speed camera. We identify three distinct jet regimes that emerge from the tip of bubble 2: conical, umbrella-shaped, and spraying jets, characterized by variations in the initial bubble-bubble distance and the initiation time difference. Our numerical simulations using both Volume of Fluid and Boundary Integral methods reproduce the experimental observations quite well and explain the mechanism of jet acceleration. We show that the transition between the regimes is governed by the spatiotemporal characteristics of the pressure wave induced by the collapse of bubble 1, which impacts the high-curvature tip of bubble 2. Specifically, a conical jet forms when the pressure wave impacts the bubble tip prior to its contraction, while an umbrella-shaped jet develops when this impact occurs after the contraction. The spraying jets result from the breakup of the bubble tip, exhibiting mist-like and needle-like morphologies with velocities ranging from 10 to over 1200 m/s. Remarkably, we observe that the penetration distance of spraying jets exceeds ten times the maximum bubble radius, making them ideal for long-range, controlled fluid delivery. Finally, phase diagrams for jet velocity and penetration distance in the $γ-θ$ parameter space are established to provide a practical reference for biomedical applications, such as needle-free injection and micro-pumping."

However, existing methods suffer from a critical issue we term Semantic Drift, where errors in early, high-level tokens irreversibly divert the generation trajectory into irrelevant semantic subspaces. Inspired by Process Reward Models (PRMs) that enhance reasoning in Large Language Models, we propose Promise, a novel framework that integrates dense, step-by-step verification into generative models. Promise features a lightweight PRM to assess the quality of intermediate inference steps, coupled with a PRM-guided Beam Search strategy that leverages dense feedback to dynamically prune erroneous branches. Crucially, our approach unlocks Test-Time Scaling Laws for recommender systems: by increasing inference compute, smaller models can match or surpass larger models. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests on a large-scale platform demonstrate that Promise effectively mitigates Semantic Drift, significantly improving recommendation accuracy while enabling efficient deployment."

Efficiently characterizing such bosonic registers requires the ability to access many motional modes with limited spin resources. Here we introduce a single-spin, multimode measurement primitive using dispersive shifts in the far-detuned multimode Jaynes-Cummings interaction. We implement a Ramsey sequence that maps phonon-number-dependent phases onto the spin, thereby realizing a multimode spin-dependent rotation (SDR). We also introduce a selective-decoupling scheme that cancels the phase induced by the carrier AC-Stark shift while preserving the phonon-number-dependent phase induced by the dispersive shift. Using this SDR-based Ramsey sequence on a single trapped ion, we experimentally extract two-mode Fock-state distributions, perform parity-based filtering of two-mode motional states, and realize a nondestructive single-shot measurement of a single-mode Fock state via repeated filtering steps."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation. Some existing VLA approaches attempt to improve action accuracy by explicitly generating linguistic reasoning traces or future visual observations before action execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching between reasoning and action inference rates during deployment. Across ten simulated and six real-world manipulation tasks, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 8% and 13% over prior VLA methods, respectively, while achieving substantially faster inference.

This spectral map also exhibits an asymmetric spin alignment with respect to the wings of the butterfly. Our analysis also suggests that the onset of such a spectral map is a combined effect of the non-hermiticity, spin-orbit interaction, and the textured magnetic field."

For the relativistic model, we establish the ergodicity, obtaining an algebraic mixing rate of any order to the Maxwell-Jüttner distribution, and the Newtonian limit (that is when the speed of light tends to infinity), approximating a system of underdamped Langevin dynamics. The proofs rely on the construction of Lyapunov functions that account for irregular potentials and multiplicative noises."

    "abstract": "3D lane detection has emerged as a critical challenge in autonomous driving, encompassing identification and localization of lane markings and the 3D road surface. Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy. Our experimental section proves the benefits of our contributions and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all detection and error metrics on existing 3D lane detection benchmarks as well as on our novel dataset."

    "abstract": "Triangular tethered formation system (TTFS) provide a promising platform for deep space exploration and distributed sensing due to its intrinsic spatial-orientation stability and capability of adjusting distances among node satellites through deployment and retrieval of tethers. However, due to the coupled tether-satellite dynamics and disturbance sensitivity of TTFS, traditional control methods struggle to achieve a balanced trade-off among configuration accuracy requirements, tension constraints, and energy efficiency consumption throughout the deployment process.In this paper, a novel model-reference reinforcement learning control framework is proposed for TTFS. By integrating baseline model-based control with a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) compensator, the proposed method simultaneously achieves high-precision tracking, fuel efficiency, and compliance with tension limits. A hierarchical training scheme is developed to address the convergence difficulties arising from strongly coupled states in centralized training, while tailored reward functions, reset conditions, and normalization criteria are designed to accelerate training convergence. Closed-loop stability of the overall control law is rigorously proven using Lyapunov methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller reduces steady-state tracking errors by over 96% for tethers and 99% for node satellites, while cutting fuel consumption by two orders of magnitude compared with the baseline method. These results validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach for TTFS deployment control."

In this work, we challenge this prevailing consensus through a systematic empirical investigation. Counter-intuitively, we find that models trained on hard-only constraints consistently outperform those trained on mixed datasets. Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data-centric refinement strategy that prioritizes reward precision. Evaluated on five benchmarks, our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 13.4\\% in performance while achieving a 58\\% reduction in training time, maintaining strong generalization beyond instruction following. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift: moving away from the indiscriminate pursuit of data diversity toward high-precision rewards."

All Li-S species exhibit robust binding to Goldene. The adsorption energies range from -4.29 to -1.90 eV. S8 that is alone interacts much less strongly. Charge density difference and Bader analyses indicate that substantial charge is transferred to the substrate, with a maximum 0.92 e for Li-rich clusters. This transfer induces polarization at the interface and shifts the work function to 5.30-5.52 eV. Projected density-of-states calculations indicate that Au-d and S-p states strongly mix near the Fermi level. This hybridization indicates that the electronic coupling is strong. Based on these results, the reaction free-energy profile for the stepwise conversion of S8 to Li2S on Goldene is thermodynamically favorable. The overall stabilization is -3.64 eV, and the rate-determining barrier for the Li2S2 -> Li2S step is 0.47 eV. This shows that Goldene is an effective surface for anchoring and mediating lithium polysulfide reactions."

Here, we explore nonequilibrium phase transitions in a dissipative Rydberg system driven by a microwave (MW) field and demonstrate their critical sensitivity to high-precision MW sensing. Distinct dynamical regimes are identified, including monostable, bistable, and oscillatory phases under mean-field coupling. Unlike single-particle detection--where the beating signal decays linearly with MW field strength--the time crystalline phase exhibits high sensitivity to MW perturbations, with rapid, discontinuous frequency switching near the monostable-oscillatory boundary. The abrupt transition is rooted in spontaneous symmetry breaking in time and is fundamentally insensitive to the background noise. On this basis, a minimum detectable MW field strength on the order of 1nV/cm is achieved by leveraging this sensitivity. Our results establish a framework for controlling time crystalline phases with external fields and advance MW sensing through many-body effects."

This creates scope for platforms to introduce systems that reduce sellers' uncertainty about quality. However, an important question remains: is it socially desirable for sellers to have more precise quality information? We present results showing that while improved information always benefits sellers, it can either benefit or harm buyers. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition under which buyers benefit, and show that this condition holds in many cases, especially when buyers' valuations are not too large relative to sellers' costs. These findings suggest that platforms should consider reducing sellers' uncertainty about quality as a means of improving market efficiency."

To enable this, we present ReFInE (Relation-aware Fine-grained Interpretability & Evidence), a dataset featuring expert verified annotations that distinguish between Quotation, Compression, and Inference. Building on ReFInE, we propose GenProve, a framework that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). By optimizing a composite reward for answer fidelity and provenance correctness, GenProve significantly outperforms 14 strong LLMs in joint evaluation.

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving federated averaging is a central approach for protecting client privacy in federated learning. In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency."

The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning. Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers. At the same time, students' reflections underscored the importance of trust, need for greater adaptivity, context-awareness, and technical refinement in future systems."

    "abstract": "Universities are widely expected to respond to technological transitions through rapid reconfiguration of programme demand and curricular supply. Using four decades of longitudinal administrative cohorts (1980-2019) from a large public university, we examine whether technological change is translated into observable shifts in programme hierarchy, or instead absorbed by institutional mechanisms that preserve structural stability. We show that programme rankings by entrant volume remain remarkably stable over time, while the translation of technological transitions into enrolment composition occurs with substantial delay. Short-run adjustment appears primarily in early persistence dynamics: attrition reacts sooner than choice, and \"growth\" in entrants can coexist with declining early survival - producing false winners in which expansion is decoupled from persistence. Macroeconomic volatility amplifies attrition and compresses between-programme differences, masking technological signals that would otherwise be interpreted as preference shifts. To explain why stability dominates responsiveness, we situate these patterns within nationally regulated constraints governing engineering education - minimum total hours and mandated practice intensity - which materially limit the speed of curricular adaptation (Ministerio de Educacion, 2021; Ley de Educacion Superior, 1995). National system metrics further support the plausibility of a high-friction equilibrium in which large inflows coexist with standardised outputs (Secretaria de Politicas Universitarias [SPU], 2022). These findings suggest that apparent rigidity is not an anomaly but the predictable outcome of a system optimised for stability over responsiveness."

Such an approach is applied in a variety of real-world domains, including risk management, automated stream data analysis, and malware detection.

This approach extends earlier methods by explicitly incorporating a diversity model into the planning process and supporting multiple planning categories. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of behaviour planning in real-world settings by presenting three case studies. The first case study focuses on storytelling, the second addresses urban planning, and the third examines game evaluation."

Furthermore, string-like foliated geometries are not suitable for the conformal compensating technique due to the conformal invariance in the longitudinal directions that is present for $p=1$. All other cases can be dealt with provided one uses a different conformal extension of the Carroll algebra that amounts to a conformal extension in the longitudinal directions only supplemented with an additional an-isotropic dilatation. By brane-duality similar results hold for foliated Galilean geometries which we present as well. Our results nicely fit in with recent work on foliated Aristotelian geometries."

The magnetism of the Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ olivine is surprisingly complex, proceeding from commensurate states to a multiferroic commensurate + incommensurate phase. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering results from a Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ single crystal and develop an effective Hamiltonian including long-distance bilinear and dipolar interactions. The magnetic interactions are predominantly antiferromagnetic and span a three-dimensional exchange network consisting of coupled sawtooth chains. Based on the determined strength of the couplings, the dominant sawtooth chains appear at third- and fourth- rather than next-nearest-neighbor. However the next-nearest-neighbor interaction is, along with a modest Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, important for modeling the observed incommensurability. We use the best-fit Hamiltonian as the basis for Langevin dynamics simulations and Luttinger-Tisza calculations of the high-temperature commensurate transition."

The argument relies on the mutual singularity of distinct invariant ergodic measures and on the observation that uniqueness follows whenever all invariant probability measures are forced to charge a common reference measure. Once existence of invariant probability measures is known, indecomposability alone is sufficient to rule out multiplicity. On standard Borel spaces, this viewpoint is consistent with the classical theory: irreducibility appears as a convenient sufficient condition ensuring indecomposability, rather than as a structural requirement for uniqueness. The resulting proofs are purely measure-theoretic and do not rely on recurrence, regeneration, return-time estimates, or regularity assumptions on the transition kernel."

Our study assesses the performance of our model in comparison to two widely employed execution strategies: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP).

By embedding task-space inertia into the observer nominal model, DW-DOB cleanly separates intrinsic dynamic reactions from true external wrenches. This preserves sensitivity to small forces and moments while ensuring robust regulation of contact wrenches. A passivity-based analysis further demonstrates that DW-DOB guarantees stable interactions under dynamic conditions, addressing the shortcomings of conventional observers that fail to compensate for inertial effects. Peg-in-hole experiments at industrial tolerances (H7/h6) validate the approach, yielding deeper and more compliant insertions with minimal residual wrenches and outperforming a conventional wrench disturbance observer and a PD baseline. These results highlight DW-DOB as a practical learning-free solution for high-precision zero-wrench control in contact-rich tasks."

These simplifications also limit interpretability: global explanations cannot identify which specific segments are misleading or differentiate how a detail is false (e.g., distorted vs. fabricated). To address these gaps, we introduce MisSpans, the first multi-domain, human-annotated benchmark for span-level misinformation detection and analysis, consisting of paired real and fake news stories. MisSpans defines three complementary tasks: MisSpansIdentity for pinpointing false spans within sentences, MisSpansType for categorising false spans by misinformation type, and MisSpansExplanation for providing rationales grounded in identified spans. Together, these tasks enable fine-grained localisation, nuanced characterisation beyond true/false and actionable explanations. Expert annotators were guided by standardised guidelines and consistency checks, leading to high inter-annotator agreement. We evaluate 15 representative LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced and non-reasoning variants, under zero-shot and one-shot settings. Results reveal the challenging nature of fine-grained misinformation identification and analysis, and highlight the need for a deeper understanding of how performance may be influenced by multiple interacting factors, including model size and reasoning capabilities, along with domain-specific textual features.

Existing studies mostly address relatively benign scenarios, namely benchmark datasets with (a) high-dimensional but sparse node features and (b) incomplete data generated under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanisms. For (a), we theoretically prove that high sparsity substantially limits the information loss caused by missingness, making all models appear robust and preventing a meaningful comparison of their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce one synthetic and three real-world datasets with dense, semantically meaningful features. For (b), we move beyond MCAR and design evaluation protocols with more realistic missingness mechanisms. Moreover, we provide a theoretical background to state explicit assumptions on the missingness process and analyze their implications for different methods. Building on this analysis, we propose GNNmim, a simple yet effective baseline for node classification with incomplete feature data. Experiments show that GNNmim is competitive with respect to specialized architectures across diverse datasets and missingness regimes."

Here, we demonstrate an unconditional Controlled-NOT quantum gate between remote diamond-based qubit devices. The control and target qubits are Carbon-13 nuclear spins, while NV electron spins enable local logic, readout, and remote entanglement generation. We benchmark the system by creating a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, showing genuine 4-partite entanglement shared between nodes.

A multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated to jointly optimize the baseband and pinching beamforming for maximizing the achievable SE and EE, which is then converted into a single-objective problem via the ε-constraint method. For WM, the problem is decomposed within the alternating-optimization framework, where the baseband beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation, and the pinching beamforming is updated through the particle swarm optimization. For WS, due to the time-division transmission and interference-free nature, the pinching beamforming in each time slot is first adjusted to maximize the served user channel gain, followed by the baseband power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) PASS outperforms conventional antennas by mitigating large-scale path losses; 2) WS leads to a higher maximum achievable EE by activating a single RF chain, whereas WM yields a higher SE upper bound by serving all users concurrently; and 3) increasing the number of users substantially enhances SE under WM, whereas WS shows more pronounced benefits in low-signal-to-noise ratio regimes."

While they have appealing properties, their isotropic metallic bonding makes their stabilization difficult and presents considerable challenges to their synthesis and practical applications. However, their stabilization can still be achieved by suspending them in the pores of two-dimensional template materials, making the properties of lateral interfaces of metallenes scientifically relevant. Here, we combined density-functional theory and universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to study lateral interfaces between graphene and 45 metallenes with various profiles. We optimized the interfaces and analyzed their energies, electronic structures, and stabilities at room temperature, defect formations, and structural deformations. While broad trends were identified using machine-learning analysis of all interfaces, density-functional theory was the main tool for studying the microscopic properties of selected elements. We found that the interfaces are the most stable energetically and with respect to lattice mismatch, defect formation, and lateral strain when their profiles were geometrically smooth. The most stable interfaces are found for transition metals. In addition, we demonstrate how universal machine-learning interatomic potentials now offer the accuracy required for the modeling of graphene-metallene interfaces. By systematically expanding the understanding of metallenes' interface properties, we hope these results guide and accelerate their synthesis to enable future applications and benefit from metallenes' appealing properties."

    "abstract": "We introduce a geometric theory of payment channel networks that centers the polytope $W_G$ of feasible wealth distributions; liquidity states $L_G$ project onto $W_G$ via strict circulations. A payment is feasible iff the post-transfer wealth stays in $W_G$. This yields a simple throughput law: if $ζ$ is on-chain settlement bandwidth and $ρ$ the expected fraction of infeasible payments, the sustainable off-chain bandwidth satisfies $S = ζ/ ρ$. Feasibility admits a cut-interval view: for any node set S, the wealth of S must lie in an interval whose width equals the cut capacity $C(δ(S))$. Using this, we show how multi-party channels (coinpools / channel factories) expand $W_G$. Modeling a k-party channel as a k-uniform hyperedge widens every cut in expectation, so $W_G$ grows monotonically with k; for single nodes the expected accessible wealth scales linearly with $k/n$. We also analyze depletion. Under linear, asymmetric fees, cost-minimizing flow within a wealth fiber pushes cycles to the boundary, generically depleting channels except for a residual spanning forest. Three mitigation levers follow: (i) symmetric fees per direction, (ii) convex/tiered fees (effective flow control but at odds with source routing without liquidity disclosure), and (iii) coordinated replenishment (choose an optimal circulation within a fiber). Together, these results explain why two-party meshes struggle to scale and why multi-party primitives are more capital-efficient, yielding higher expected payment bandwidth. They also show how fee design and coordination keep operation inside the feasible region, improving reliability."

    "abstract": "Diffractive neural networks have recently emerged as a promising framework for all-optical computing. However, these networks are typically trained for a single task, limiting their potential adoption in systems requiring multiple functionalities. Existing approaches to achieving multi-task functionality either modify the mechanical configuration of the network per task or use a different illumination wavelength or polarization state for each task. In this work, we propose a new control mechanism, which is based on the illumination's angular spectrum. Specifically, we shape the illumination using an amplitude mask that selectively controls its angular spectrum. We employ different illumination masks for achieving different network functionalities, so that the mask serves as a unique task encoder. Interestingly, we show that effective control can be achieved over a very narrow angular range, within the paraxial regime. We numerically illustrate the proposed approach by training a single diffractive network to perform multiple image-to-image translation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate translating handwritten digits into typeset digits of different values, and translating handwritten English letters into typeset numbers and typeset Greek letters, where the type of the output is determined by the illumination's angular components. As we show, the proposed framework can work under different coherence conditions, and can be combined with existing control strategies, such as different wavelengths. Our results establish the illumination angular spectrum as a powerful degree of freedom for controlling diffractive networks, enabling a scalable and versatile framework for multi-task all-optical computing."

We present a framework based solely on unitary dynamics to design quantum simulations for thermal states with respect to Hamiltonians that include non-native interactions, suitable for both present-day digital and analogue devices. By classical means, our method finds the control sequence to reach a target thermal state for system sizes well out of reach of state-vector or density-matrix control methods, even though quantum hardware is required to explicitly simulate the thermal state dynamics. With the illustrative example of the cluster Ising model that includes non-native three-body interactions, we find that required experimental resources, such as the total evolution time, are independent of temperature and criticality."

While detector-based approaches typically achieve strong frame-level accuracy, they often suffer from temporal inconsistencies caused by frequent detection dropouts. Despite its practical relevance, research on RGB-based drone tracking is still limited and largely reliant on conventional motion models. Meanwhile, foundation models like SAMURAI have established their effectiveness across other domains, exhibiting strong category-agnostic tracking performance. However, their applicability in drone-specific scenarios has not been investigated yet. Motivated by this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of SAMURAI's potential for robust drone tracking in urban surveillance settings. Furthermore, we introduce a detector-augmented extension of SAMURAI to mitigate sensitivity to bounding-box initialization and sequence length. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed extension significantly improves robustness in complex urban environments, with pronounced benefits in long-duration sequences - especially under drone exit-re-entry events. The incorporation of detector cues yields consistent gains over SAMURAI's zero-shot performance across datasets and metrics, with success rate improvements of up to +0.393 and FNR reductions of up to -0.475."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models often assign authoritative roles to improve performance, yet the impact of authority bias on agent interactions remains underexplored. We present the first systematic analysis of role-based authority bias in free-form multi-agent evaluation using ChatEval. Applying French and Raven's power-based theory, we classify authoritative roles into legitimate, referent, and expert types and analyze their influence across 12-turn conversations. Experiments with GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 reveal that Expert and Referent power roles exert stronger influence than Legitimate power roles. Crucially, authority bias emerges not through active conformity by general agents, but through authoritative roles consistently maintaining their positions while general agents demonstrate flexibility. Furthermore, authority influence requires clear position statements, as neutral responses fail to generate bias. These findings provide key insights for designing multi-agent frameworks with asymmetric interaction patterns."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable agentic systems trained with reinforcement learning (RL) over multi-turn interaction trajectories, but practical deployment is bottlenecked by rapidly growing textual histories that inflate token budgets and memory usage. We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression."

    "abstract": "The Euclid satellite will measure spectroscopic redshifts for tens of millions of emission-line galaxies. In the context of Stage-IV surveys, the 3-dimensional clustering of galaxies plays a key role in providing cosmological constraints. In this paper, we conduct a model comparison for the multipole moments of the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2PCF) in redshift space. We test state-of-the-art models, in particular the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFT), one based on the velocity difference generating function (VDG$_{\\infty}$), and different variants of Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) models, such as convolutional LPT (CLPT) and its effective-field-theory extension (CLEFT). We analyse the first three even multipoles of the 2PCF in the Flagship 1 simulation, which consists of four snapshots at $z\\in\\{0.9,1.2,1.5,1.8\\}$. We study both template-fitting and full-shape approaches and find that with the template-fitting approach, only the VDG$_{\\infty}$ model is able to reach a minimum fitting scale of $s_{\\rm min}=20\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0.9$ without biasing the recovered parameters. Indeed, the EFT model becomes inaccurate already at $s_{\\rm min}=30\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$. Conversely, in the full-shape analysis, the CLEFT and VDG$_{\\infty}$ models perform similarly well, but only the CLEFT model can reach $s_{\\rm min}=20\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ while the VDG$_{\\infty}$ model is unbiased down to $s_{\\rm min}=25\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ at the lowest redshift. Overall, in order to achieve the accuracy required by Euclid, non-perturbative modelling such as in the VDG$_{\\infty}$ or CLEFT models should be considered. At $z=1.8$, the CLPT model is sufficient to describe the data with high figure of merit. This comparison selects baseline models that perform best in ideal conditions and sets the stage for an optimal analysis of Euclid data in configuration space."

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades, defocus has consistently provided groundbreaking depth information in scene images. However, accurately estimating depth from 2D images continues to be a persistent and fundamental challenge in the field of 3D recovery. Heuristic approaches involve with the ill-posed problem for inferring the spatial variant defocusing blur, as the desired blur cannot be distinguished from the inherent blur. Given a prior knowledge of the defocus model, the problem become well-posed with an analytic solution for the relative blur between two images, taken at the same viewpoint with different camera settings for the focus. The Gaussian model stands out as an optimal choice for real-time applications, due to its mathematical simplicity and computational efficiency. And theoretically, it is the only model can be applied at the same time to both the absolute blur caused by depth in a single image and the relative blur resulting from depth differences between two images. This paper introduces the settings, for conventional imaging devices, to ensure that the defocusing operator adheres to the Gaussian model. Defocus analysis begins within the framework of geometric optics and is conducted by defocus aberration theory in diffraction-limited optics to obtain the accuracy of fitting the actual model to its Gaussian approximation. The results for a typical set of focused depths between $1$ and $100$ meters, with a maximum depth variation of $10\\%$ at the focused depth, confirm the Gaussian model's applicability for defocus operators in most imaging devices. The findings demonstrate a maximum Mean Absolute Error $(\\!M\\!A\\!E)$ of less than $1\\%$, underscoring the model's accuracy and reliability."

    "abstract": "Chiral matter acting as a spin-selective device in biased electron transport is attracting attention for the quantum-technological design of miniaturized electronics. To date, however, experimental reports on spin selectivity are not conclusive. The magnetoresistance in electron transport measurements observed for chiral materials on ferromagnets upon magnetisation reversal is proposed to result from electrostatic rather than from the sought-after chiral effects. Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface. Our key finding is the dependence of the signal strength of these states in spectroscopy of the differential conductance on the handedness of the molecule. The experiments unveil the role of the enantiomers as spin polarisers and the irrelevance of electrostatics in the chosen model system."

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) transition from general knowledge retrieval to complex scientific discovery, their evaluation standards must also incorporate the rigorous norms of scientific inquiry. Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science."

We find that the Young modulus and yield stress of the gels increase monotonically with the instantaneous colloid volume fraction, $φ$, exhibiting a mechanical response that depends solely on $φ$, regardless of the drying history. In striking contrast, small-angle X-ray scattering reveals that the gel microstructure retains a strong memory of its initial state, depending on both $\\varphi$ and the entire compression pathway. Our findings challenge the prevailing paradigm of a one-to-one relationship between microstructure and elasticity in colloidal fractal gels, opening new avenues for independent control over the structural and mechanical properties of soft materials."

Beam splitters, a fundamental building block of photonic circuits, have recently been demonstrated in free space using geometric-phase optical elements. These devices coherently mix circularly-polarized transverse modes of freely-propagating optical fields, including modes carrying orbital angular momentum. In this work, we investigate liquid-crystal metagratings as electrically tunable beam splitters for transverse-momentum optical modes. By exploiting the voltage-controlled birefringence of liquid-crystal metasurfaces, we experimentally tune the splitting ratio of the device and thereby control the degree of two-photon interference between indistinguishable photons. At the output, photons are spatially resolved on different regions of a time-resolved single-photon-sensitive detector, enabling the reconstruction of coincidence maps in the Fourier plane. This approach is readily scalable and enables highly parallel coincidence measurements across a large number of optical modes."

Here we consider such encounters between an intermediate mass spinning black hole and a close identical white dwarf binary system whose center of mass follows a parabolic trajectory. After studying a corresponding three-body problem in the point particle approximation, we perform a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics based numerical simulations of such scenarios. For this, we integrate the geodesic equations for the spinning black hole, while considering the hydrodynamics and the self and mutual gravitational interactions of the stars in a Newtonian approximation, an approach justified by the choice of parameters in the theory. We consider various initial configurations of the binary center of mass leading to equatorial and off-equatorial orbits, as also various initial inclinations between the binary's initial spin angular momentum and its initial orbital angular momentum. We find that the effects of black hole spin manifest clearly in the tidal dynamics of the binary components, while the observables of tidal encounters such as mass fallback rates are strongly dependent on the initial inclination angle. We show that the influence of the black hole spin emerges in distinct ways for different initial configurations of the binary's spin alignment. We establish that within the ambits of the Hills mechanism, in certain cases, the fallback rate may show a three-hump structure, due to interactions between tidal debris of the individual stars."

Theoretical and experimental investigations are actively progressing to provide the capability of efficient switching and precise control of the Néel vector, which is crucial for the intended practical applications of antiferromagnets. Recently, a time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory has been successfully developed to study the sublattice magnetization switching in anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets [K. Bolsmann $et \\, al.$, \\textcolor{blue}{\\hyperlink{10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030332}{PRX Quantum $\\mathbf{4}$, 030332 (2023)}}]. Here we use a complementary exact diagonalization method to study such sublattice magnetization switching, but in small-cluster quantum antiferromagnets, by means of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, this article aims to support the findings of the Schwinger boson approach. We show that the results of both approaches are consistent at short time scales, with only about 12.5 $\\%$ deviations. The consistency of the outcomes obtained through this alternative exact approach demonstrates that the time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory is a versatile framework to capture the essentials of the switching process in quantum antiferromagnets. Thereby, the findings of current article pave the way for further theoretical and computational progress in the study of antiferromagnets for engineering spintronic devices with ultrahigh density and ultrafast speed."

We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations."

The model, trained on one news media dataset also showed high accuracy when used to analyze a different news dataset. For social media, such as YouTube, we developed other models to measure levels of social dimensions important in peace using word level (GoEmotions) and context level (Large Language Model) methods. To promote peace, we note that 71% of people 20-40 years old daily view most of their news through short videos on social media. Content creators of these videos are biased towards creating videos with emotional activation, making you angry to engage you, to increase clicks. We developed and tested a Chrome extension, MirrorMirror, which provides real-time feedback to YouTube viewers about the peacefulness of the media they are watching. Our long term goal is for MirrorMirror to evolve into an open-source tool for content creators, journalists, researchers, platforms, and individual users to better understand the tone of their media creation and consumption and its effects on viewers. Moving beyond simple engagement metrics, we hope to encourage more respectful, nuanced, and informative communication."

Our definition is a coordinate-free version of the standard definition of the Riemann integral on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and we argue that it is the natural definition in the contexts of Lie algebroids, stochastic integration and quantum field theory, where path integrals are defined using lattices. In particular, our definition naturally incorporates the different stochastic integrals, which involve integration over Hölder continuous paths. Furthermore, our definition is well-adapted to establishing integral identities from their combinatorial counterparts. Our construction is based on the observation that, in great generality, the things that are integrated are determined by cochains on the pair groupoid. Abstractly, our definition uses the van Est map to lift a differential form to the pair groupoid. Our construction suggests a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus which we prove: the singular cohomology and de Rham cohomology cap products of a cocycle with the fundamental class are equal."

    "abstract": "I propose a novel framework that integrates stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with deep generative models to improve uncertainty quantification in machine learning applications involving structured and temporal data. This approach, termed Stochastic Latent Differential Inference (SLDI), embeds an Itô SDE in the latent space of a variational autoencoder, allowing for flexible, continuous-time modeling of uncertainty while preserving a principled mathematical foundation. The drift and diffusion terms of the SDE are parameterized by neural networks, enabling data-driven inference and generalizing classical time series models to handle irregular sampling and complex dynamic structure. A central theoretical contribution is the co-parameterization of the adjoint state with a dedicated neural network, forming a coupled forward-backward system that captures not only latent evolution but also gradient dynamics. I introduce a pathwise-regularized adjoint loss and analyze variance-reduced gradient flows through the lens of stochastic calculus, offering new tools for improving training stability in deep latent SDEs. My paper unifies and extends variational inference, continuous-time generative modeling, and control-theoretic optimization, providing a rigorous foundation for future developments in stochastic probabilistic machine learning."

Le~Cam showed that, when $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ have a common dominating measure, a test that has power exceeding its level by more than $\\varepsilon$ exists if and only if the convex hulls of $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ are separated in total variation distance by more than $\\varepsilon$. The requirement of a dominating measure is frequently violated in nonparametric statistics. In a passing remark, Le~Cam described an approach to address more general scenarios, but he stopped short of stating a formal theorem. This work completes Le~Cam's program, by presenting a matching necessary and sufficient condition for testability: for the aforementioned theorem to hold without assumptions, one must take the closures of the convex hulls of $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ in the space of bounded finitely additive measures. We provide simple elucidating examples, and elaborate on various subtle measure theoretic and topological points regarding compactness and achievability."

This undermines the reliability of LLM based agents in production systems as it leads to inconsistent results, and bypasses security and audit controls. Such hallucinations in agent tool selection require early detection and error handling. Unlike existing hallucination detection methods that require multiple forward passes or external validation, we present a computationally efficient framework that detects tool-calling hallucinations in real-time by leveraging LLMs' internal representations during the same forward pass used for generation. We evaluate this approach on reasoning tasks across multiple domains, demonstrating strong detection performance (up to 86.4\\% accuracy) while maintaining real-time inference capabilities with minimal computational overhead, particularly excelling at detecting parameter-level hallucinations and inappropriate tool selections, critical for reliable agent deployment."

    "abstract": "Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in studying neurological development, aging, and diseases. One key application is Brain Age Prediction (BAP), which estimates an individual's biological brain age from MRI data. Effective BAP models require large, diverse, and age-balanced datasets, whereas existing 3D MRI datasets are demographically skewed, limiting fairness and generalizability. Acquiring new data is costly and ethically constrained, motivating generative data augmentation. Current generative methods are often based on latent diffusion models, which operate in learned low dimensional latent spaces to address the memory demands of volumetric MRI data. However, these methods are typically slow at inference, may introduce artifacts due to latent compression, and are rarely conditioned on age, thereby affecting the BAP performance. In this work, we propose FlowLet, a conditional generative framework that synthesizes age-conditioned 3D MRIs by leveraging flow matching within an invertible 3D wavelet domain, helping to avoid reconstruction artifacts and reducing computational demands. Experiments show that FlowLet generates high-fidelity volumes with few sampling steps. Training BAP models with data generated by FlowLet improves performance for underrepresented age groups, and region-based analysis confirms preservation of anatomical structures."

This contractive, operator-valued left multiplier, the characteristic function of the CNC row contraction, is a complete unitary invariant and it is always column-extreme as a contractive left multiplier. Our construction builds a model reproducing kernel Hilbert space of NC functions using a \"non-commutative resolvent\" of the row contraction, $T$, which is the inverse of the monic, affine linear pencil of $T$ in a certain NC unit row-ball of the NC universe of all row tuples of square matrices of all finite sizes."

The flow is the coupling of the Ricci flow of underlying metrics and the isometric flow of $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, but we also provide explicit lower order in the torsion terms. The lower order terms and the flow are obtained by analyzing the second order term in the Taylor series expansion of $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures in normal coordinates. As such, the Ricci-harmonic flow described in the paper can be interpreted as the \"heat equation\" for $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. The lower order terms allow us to prove that the stationary points of the Ricci-harmonic flow are exactly torsion-free $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures on compact manifolds. We study various analytic and geometric properties of the flow. We show that the flow has short-time existence and uniqueness on compact manifolds starting with an arbitrary $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structure and prove global Shi-type estimates. We also prove a modified local Shi-type estimates for the flow which assume bounds on the initial derivatives of the Riemann curvature tensor and the torsion but give uniform bounds on these quantities for all times. We prove a compactness theorem for the solutions of the flow and use it to prove that the Ricci-harmonic flow exists as long as the velocity of the flow remains bounded. We also study Ricci-harmonic solitons where we prove that there are no compact expanding solitons and the only steady solitons are torsion-free. We derive an analog of Hamilton's identity for gradient Ricci-harmonic solitons and prove some integral identities for the solitons. Finally, we prove a version of the Taylor series expansion for Spin(7)-structures and use it to derive the Ricci-harmonic flow of Spin(7)-structures."

I study a model in which an employee uses private information to make decisions on behalf of the organization and analyze the belief design problem, namely, how the organization would like the employee to interpret his observations. I show that organizations prefer employees whose actions reflect a constant expected conflict of interest across observations. A well-calibrated employee is optimal if and only if private information does not affect this conflict. When the conflict varies with information, organizations optimally select employees whose confidence distorts their responses to information. Overconfidence is optimal when the organization seeks stronger adjustments to information than a well-calibrated employee would provide."

A classical result of Mac Lane states that planar graphs are exactly graphs with basis number at most 2, and more generally, graphs embedded on a fixed surface are known to have bounded basis number. Generalising this, we prove that graphs excluding a fixed minor $H$ have bounded basis number. Our proof uses the Graph Minor Structure Theorem, which requires us to understand how basis number behaves in tree-decompositions. In particular, we prove that graphs of treewidth $k$ have basis number bounded by some function of $k$. We handle tree-decompositions using the proof framework developed by Bojańczyk and Pilipczuk in their proof of Courcelle's conjecture. Combining our approach with independent results of Miraftab, Morin and Yuditsky (2025) on basis number and path-decompositions, one can moreover improve our upper bound to a polynomial one: there exists an absolute constant $c>0$ such that every $H$-minor free graph has basis number $O(|H|^c)$."

This provides the first fully local and dimension-independent generalization of all known criteria for bulk fields. Within this framework, we show that a free scalar field is consistent and localized, whereas minimally and non-minimally coupled Maxwell fields violate the conditions, leading to a no-go theorem valid in any dimension. For nonlinear electrodynamics, we find that only the model $L(F)=b\\sqrt{F}$ admits a consistent and normalizable zero mode, and that among p-forms, consistency occurs solely for the free 0-form. We also demonstrate that Dirac fermions, with or without Yukawa terms, are inconsistent within this framework and therefore cannot propagate in the bulk. Our local approach makes explicit that these conclusions do not depend on any particular internal geometry or warp factor: previously known results arise merely as special cases of a broader and strictly local structure, highlighting the universality of the constraints derived here."

A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization. SimuAgent trains and runs entirely on-premise with modest hardware, delivering a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering. SimuAgent bridges the gap between LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical solution for AI-assisted engineering design in industrial settings."

Motivated by this, we propose VideoAuto-R1, a video understanding framework that adopts a reason-when-necessary strategy. During training, our approach follows a Thinking Once, Answering Twice paradigm: the model first generates an initial answer, then performs reasoning, and finally outputs a reviewed answer. Both answers are supervised via verifiable rewards. During inference, the model uses the confidence score of the initial answer to determine whether to proceed with reasoning. Across video QA and grounding benchmarks, VideoAuto-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly improved efficiency, reducing the average response length by ~3.3x, e.g., from 149 to just 44 tokens. Moreover, we observe a low rate of thinking-mode activation on perception-oriented tasks, but a higher rate on reasoning-intensive tasks. This suggests that explicit language-based reasoning is generally beneficial but not always necessary."

Unlike conventional asymptotic analyses, we explicitly account for the limitations under FBL constraints imposed by short packets and low-latency transmission. By examining the unbiased channel state sensing estimator, we establish a geometric decomposition of the sensing error, indicating that it is jointly determined by the signal-to-noise ratio and the correlation structure of the information codebook. This insight reveals how cross-correlation among active users in the codebook geometry fundamentally constrains dual-functional ISAC performance. Consequently, we derive achievability and converse bounds that characterize the tradeoff between communication code rate and sensing accuracy in the FBL regime, with the converse further bounded by Shannon capacity. Moreover, by treating channel state sensing as a high-level sensing objective, a universal Cramér--Rao bound is derived to link channel estimation accuracy to practical sensing parameters. Examples of parameter sensing are also provided based on 3GPP standard. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impact of blocklength, antenna dimensions, and sensing requirements."

Yet, many distinctive features of quantum theory are genuinely multipartite and cannot be reduced to two-party behaviour. In this work we are interested in extending this simultaneous purification inspired result to all multipartite communication schemes. As a first step, we unify and extend the simultaneous purification result from states to instruments and super-instruments, which are composable structures, and open up the possibility to explore more complex communication scenarios. Our main contribution is to establish that arbitrary compositions of non-signalling assemblages cannot escape the standard spatial quantum Bell correlations set.

In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings."

Despite its criticality, the robustness of current T2I safety filters against such politically motivated adversarial prompting remains underexplored. In response, we propose $PC^2$, the first black-box political jailbreaking framework for T2I models. It exploits a novel vulnerability where safety filters evaluate political sensitivity based on linguistic context. $PC^2$ operates through: (1) Identity-Preserving Descriptive Mapping to obfuscate sensitive keywords into neutral descriptions, and (2) Geopolitically Distal Translation to map these descriptions into fragmented, low-sensitivity languages. This strategy prevents filters from constructing toxic relationships between political entities within prompts, effectively bypassing detection. We construct a benchmark of 240 politically sensitive prompts involving 36 public figures. Evaluation on commercial T2I models, specifically GPT-series, shows that while all original prompts are blocked, $PC^2$ achieves attack success rates of up to 86%."

To bridge this gap, we introduce VerseCrafter, a 4D-aware video world model that enables explicit and coherent control over both camera and object dynamics within a unified 4D geometric world state. Our approach is centered on a novel 4D Geometric Control representation, which encodes the world state through a static background point cloud and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories. This representation captures not only an object's path but also its probabilistic 3D occupancy over time, offering a flexible, category-agnostic alternative to rigid bounding boxes or parametric models. These 4D controls are rendered into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to the specified dynamics. Unfortunately, another major challenge lies in the scarcity of large-scale training data with explicit 4D annotations. We address this by developing an automatic data engine that extracts the required 4D controls from in-the-wild videos, allowing us to train our model on a massive and diverse dataset."

    "abstract": "We show that the classification up to homeomorphism of closed topological nonorientable 4-manifolds with fundamental group of order 2 due to Hambleton-Kreck-Teichner can be used to classify a large set of such 4-manifolds with cyclic fundamental group of order 2p for every odd $p > 1$. This is done through a simple cut-and-paste construction, and classical and modified surgery theory are used only through results of Hambleton-Kreck-Teichner and Khan. It is plausible that this set comprises all closed topological nonorientable 4-manifolds with $π_1 = \\Z/2p$. We collect several interesting questions whose answers would guarantee a complete classification."

    "abstract": "One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame. We, thereby, show that classical simulation techniques can directly benefit from a perspective -- that of frames -- that goes beyond the traditional classification of quantum resources."

We validate the methodology by training on the synthetic MERIT Dataset and evaluating on its real-world counterpart, MERIT Secret.

    "abstract": "Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb."

Here, based on the duality of the quantum state evolution in Fock state space and the optical wave-function propagation in a waveguide array, we introduce a Kerr-engineered multi-lens protocol in a single bosonic mode to deterministically generate Fock states exceeding $10,000$ photons. By optimizing phase and displacement operations across lens groups, our approach compensates for non-paraxial aberrations, achieving fidelities above $73\\%$ in numerical simulations for photon numbers up to $N=100,000$. Counterintuitively, the protocol's execution time scales as $N^{-1/2}$ with the target photon number $N$, exhibiting robustness against the photon loss. Our framework enables exploration of quantum-to-classical transitions of giant Fock states, paving the way for advanced quantum metrology with significant quantum gains, and error-corrected quantum information processing in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces."

In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity. As a solution, we propose tractable approximations of the algorithm that can still yield much improved logic programs in typical cases, e.g., it can improve the performance of rule systems over real-world data in the order of magnitude."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strengths across diverse domains. However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks."

While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users."

We introduce a literature-driven framework that discovers datasets from citation contexts in scientific papers, enabling retrieval grounded in actual research use rather than metadata availability. Our approach combines large-scale citation-context extraction, schema-guided dataset recognition with Large Language Models, and provenance-preserving entity resolution. We evaluate the system on eight survey-derived computer science queries and find that it achieves substantially higher recall than Google Dataset Search and DataCite Commons, with normalized recall ranging from an average of 47.47% to a highest value of 81.82%. Beyond recovering gold-standard datasets, the method also surfaces additional datasets not documented in the surveys. Expert assessments across five top-level Fields of Science indicate that a substantial portion of the additional datasets are considered high utility, and some are regarded as novel for the specific topics chosen by the experts. These findings establish citation-context mining as an effective and generalizable paradigm for dataset discovery, particularly in settings where datasets lack sufficient or reliable metadata. To support reproducibility and future extensions, we release our code, evaluation datasets, and results on GitHub (https://github.com/Fireblossom/citation-context-dataset-discovery)."

With the aid of custom-trained machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) we have performed a high-throughput sampling of over 3 million randomly-generated crystal packing arrangements and identified 9626 energy minima characterized by 1493 network topologies, including 864 topologies that have not been reported before. Comparisons with previously reported structures revealed 13 topological matches to the experimentally-observed structures of ZnIm2, demonstrating the power of the CSP method in sampling experimentally-relevant ZIF structures. Finally, through a combination of topological analysis, density and porosity considerations, we have identified a set of structures representing promising targets for future experimental screening. Finally, we demonstrate how CSP can be used to assist in the identification of the products of the mechanochemical synthesis."

Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, built for monolingual data, often fail to interpret the syntactic and semantic complexity of this code-mixed language, resulting in inaccurate sentiment analysis and misleading market insights. To address this gap, we propose a high-performance sentiment classification framework specifically designed for Hinglish tweets. Our approach fine-tunes mBERT (Multilingual BERT), leveraging its multilingual capabilities to better understand the linguistic diversity of Indian social media. A key component of our methodology is the use of subword tokenization, which enables the model to effectively manage spelling variations, slang, and out-of-vocabulary terms common in Romanized Hinglish. This research delivers a production-ready AI solution for brand sentiment tracking and establishes a strong benchmark for multilingual NLP in low-resource, code-mixed environments."

We aim to constrain the vertical and meridional distribution of stratospheric CO and assess the relative contributions of these potential sources. Here, we analysed high-spectral-resolution ALMA observations of the CO (J=3-2) line obtained on 25 May 2018, sampling Saturn's limb from 20°S to 69°N. CO vertical profiles were retrieved using a line-by-line radiative transfer model combined with spectral inversion techniques, testing multiple prior scenarios representative of different source hypotheses. CO is confined to a narrow layer between 0.1 and 1 mbar, with a robust negative vertical gradient and mean abundances of (3.7+/- 0.8) x 10$^{-8}$ at 0.1 mbar and (7.2 +/- 0.9) x 10$^{-8}$ at 1 mbar. The meridional distribution is statistically homogeneous, with a marginal enhancement near 60° N plausibly related to Enceladus. No significant equatorial enhancement is detected. The absence of a strong equatorial enhancement rules out a long-lived steady source associated with ring infall. The observations are most consistent with a relatively recent ($\\approx$200-year-old or younger) cometary impact whose material has since been horizontally mixed, while any Cassini Grand Finale ring influx was either too recent or inefficient to affect CO abundances at the probed pressure levels."

Alongside the girth, we introduce a new graph invariant, the weighted girth, which takes into account the labels of the defining graph. Within the class of two-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type, we characterise the weighted girth in terms of certain minimal right-angled Artin subgroups, showing that it is an isomorphism invariant. Finally, under the further hypothesis of leafless defining graph, we recover the weighted girth as the girth of the commutation graph introduced by Hagen-Martin-Sisto."

Quantum computers can potentially provide high-degree polynomial speed-ups for solving PDEs, however many algorithms simply end with preparing the quantum state encoding the solution in its amplitudes. Trying to access explicit properties of the solution naively with quantum amplitude estimation can subsequently diminish the potential speed-up. In this work, we present a technique for extracting a smooth positive function encoded in the amplitudes of a quantum state, which achieves the Heisenberg limit scaling. We improve upon previous methods by allowing higher dimensional functions, by significantly reducing the quantum complexity with respect to the number of qubits encoding the function, and by removing the dependency on the minimum of the function using preconditioning. Our technique works by sampling the cumulative distribution of the given function, fitting it with Chebyshev polynomials, and subsequently extracting a representation of the whole encoded function. Finally, we trial our method by carrying out small scale numerical simulations."

The former lacks further optimization of the model and results in limited performance, while the latter alters the internal computational mechanisms of the model, thereby compromising its generative capabilities. We propose SemPA, a novel approach that boosts the sentence representations while preserving the generative ability of LLMs via semantic preference alignment. We leverage sentence-level Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to efficiently optimize LLMs on a paraphrase generation task, where the model learns to discriminate semantically equivalent sentences while preserving inherent generative capacity. Theoretically, we establish a formal connection between DPO and contrastive learning under the Plackett-Luce model framework. Empirically, experimental results on both semantic textual similarity tasks and various benchmarks for LLMs show that SemPA achieves better semantic representations without sacrificing the inherent generation capability of LLMs."

However, the influence of power flow variables on system stability has received limited attention. Conventional small-signal stability analyses are typically conducted at a specific operating point, emphasizing the selection of control or system design parameters while neglecting the sensitivity of stability characteristics to operating conditions. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by systematically investigating the impact of dispatch decisions on the small-signal stability of converter-based power systems. Our findings are first illustrated on a three-bus system and then validated on the standard IEEE 39-bus test system to demonstrate scalability. Across the test systems, we find that high-voltage capacitive operation of GFL converters limits its active power injection, whereas inductive operation permits higher injections, and it is generally preferable for the GFM converter to supply more active power."

But it remains unclear whether this persuasive power advantages truth over falsehood, or if LLMs can promote misbeliefs just as easily as refuting them. Here, we investigate this question across three pre-registered experiments in which participants (N = 2,724 Americans) discussed a conspiracy theory they were uncertain about with GPT-4o, and the model was instructed to either argue against (\"debunking\") or for (\"bunking\") that conspiracy. When using a \"jailbroken\" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs possess potent abilities to promote both truth and falsehood, but that potential solutions may exist to help mitigate this risk."

Given the stringent trade-off between training costs and model performance, the pivotal question is whether the optimal LR can be accurately extrapolated from low-cost experiments. In this paper, we formalize this investigation into two distinct research paradigms: Fitting and Transfer. Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_η) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $μ$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $μ$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis through the dual lenses of training stability and feature learning to elucidate the underlying reasons why module-wise parameter tuning underperforms in large-scale settings. This work offers systematic practical guidelines and a fresh theoretical perspective for optimizing industrial-level pre-training."

    "abstract": "The launch of relativistic jets of plasma on astrophysical to cosmological scales are observed in a variety of astrophysical sources, from active galactic nuclei to X-rays binaries. While these jets can be reproduced by the general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) and particle-in-cells (GRPIC) simulations of the dynamical Kerr magnetosphere, the development of analytic models to describe the physics of the jets has remained limited. A key challenge is to analytically describe the individual trajectories of accelerated charged particles which ultimately build up the jet and emit radiation. In this work, we provide a first simple but fully analytical model of jet launching from the Kerr magnetosphere based on the motion of charged particles. To that end, we use the integrability of electrogeodesic motion in the Kerr monopole magnetosphere to study the ejection of charged particles near the poles. This enables us to derive (i) a criterion for the rotation axis to constitute a stable latitunal equilibrium position, thereby representing an idealized jet, (ii) the expression for the magnetic frame-dragging effect, and (iii) the condition for an asymptotic observer to measure blueshifted particles emanating from the black hole surroundings. Our study reveals that particles can be accelerated only in a specific region whose maximal radius depends on the spin and magnetization of the black hole. Alongside these results, we provide a detailed review of the construction of test magnetospheres from (explicit and hidden) symmetries of the Kerr geometry and the condition for the separability of the electrogeodesic motion in a test magnetosphere, which serves as a basis for the model we study in this work."

    "abstract": "Quantum thermometry provides a key capability for nanoscale devices and quantum technologies, but most existing strategies rely on probes initialized near equilibrium. This equilibrium paradigm imposes intrinsic limitations: sensitivity is tied to long-time thermalization and often cannot be improved in fast, noisy, or nonstationary settings. In contrast, the \\textit{Mpemba effect}, the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter states relax faster than colder ones, has mostly been viewed as a thermodynamic anomaly. Here, we bridge this gap by proving that Mpemba-type inversions generically yield a finite-time enhancement of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation, thereby converting an anomalous relaxation effect into a concrete metrological resource. Through explicit analyses of two-level and $Λ$-level probes coupled to bosonic baths, we show that nonequilibrium initializations can transiently outperform both equilibrium strategies and colder states, realizing a \\emph{metrological Mpemba effect}. Our results establish anomalous relaxation as a general design principle for nonequilibrium quantum thermometry, enabling ultrafast and nanoscale sensing protocols that exploit, rather than avoid, transient dynamics."

To examine the dosimetric influence of hidden input parameters in three IO algorithms-IPSA, HIPO, and MCO-for GYN HDR brachytherapy across two applicator types. In-house implementations of IPSA, HIPO, and MCO were implemented and evaluated against retrospectively generated commercial TPS plans (Oncentra Brachy) using identical clinical input parameters across 24 cervical cancer cases (18 T&O; 6 T&O+Needles (T&O+N)). Each IO algorithm was assessed using 1k combinations of hidden parameters (e.g., dwell-time modulation constraints, convergence thresholds). Cumulative DVH curves and dosimetric indices (HR-CTV D98/D90, OAR D2cc) were compared with commercial plans. Standard deviations (SD) of DVH differences were used to characterize sensitivity to hidden parameters. For HR-CTV, SD values in T&O+N cases reached 23.0 Gy and 7.1 Gy for MCO and HIPO, respectively, with corresponding average values of 55.8 Gy and 19.7 Gy. In T&O cases, HR-CTV SD values reached 4.9 Gy and 3.3 Gy for HIPO and IPSA, respectively, with average values of 20.1 Gy and 8.6 Gy. MCO exhibited the highest sensitivity, followed by HIPO and IPSA. T&O+N cases showed greater sensitivity than T&O cases. Absolute differences in HR-CTV D90 (D98) relative to commercial algorithms reached up to 33.3 Gy (28.4) for T&O+N cases and 10.8 Gy (8.5) for T&O cases. For OARs, absolute D2cc differences in T&O+N (T&O) cases reached up to 8.6 Gy (2.3) for rectum, 17 Gy (10.2) for bladder, 14.8 Gy (3.9) for sigmoid, and 7.0 Gy (8.1) for bowel. Hidden input parameter settings significantly impact on GYN HDR plans, with target coverage up to 28.4 Gy across IO algorithms for both T&O and T&O+N cases.

    "abstract": "The Taub-NUT and Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instantons, along with the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric, form a set of Euclidean metrics which can naturally be called `self-dual black holes', as they arise from self-dual slices of the most general vacuum, asymptotically flat black hole metric. These self-dual black holes are of interest for many reasons, and can famously be described through the non-linear graviton construction of twistor theory. However, the implicit nature of this twistor description obscures some features of the underlying geometry, particularly for the most general self-dual black holes. In this paper, we give a new construction of all asymptotically flat self-dual black holes based on holomorphic quadrics in flat dual twistor space, rather than the usual twistor space associated with self-duality. Remarkably, the geometry of the self-dual black holes -- including their hyperkahler structure, as well as Kerr-Schild and Gibbons-Hawking forms -- is directly encoded in the corresponding quadric. As a consequence, we obtain a previously unknown single Kerr-Schild form of the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric."

Conventional approaches frequently neglect external influences like weather, festivities, and equipment breakdowns, resulting in inefficiencies. This research investigates the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve demand prediction in retail and vending machine sectors. Four machine learning algorithms. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Facebook Prophet (Fb Prophet), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to forecast inventory requirements. Ex-ternal factors like weekdays, holidays, and sales deviation indicators were methodically incorporated to enhance precision. XGBoost surpassed other models, reaching the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 22.7 with the inclusion of external variables. ARIMAX and Fb Prophet demonstrated noteworthy enhancements, whereas SVR fell short in performance. Incorporating external factors greatly improves the precision of demand forecasting models, and XGBoost is identified as the most efficient algorithm. This study offers a strong framework for enhancing inventory management in retail and vending machine systems."

    "abstract": "When simulating three-dimensional flows interacting with deformable and elastic obstacles, current methods often encounter complexities in the governing equations and challenges in numerical implementation. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical formulation for simulating incompressible viscous flows at low Reynolds numbers in the presence of deformable interfaces. Our method employs a vorticity-stream vector formulation that significantly simplifies the fluid solver, transforming it into a set of coupled Poisson problems. The body-fluid interface is modeled using a phase field, allowing for the incorporation of various free-energy models to account for membrane bending and surface tension. In contrast to existing three-dimensional approaches, such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods or boundary-integral techniques, our formulation is lightweight and grounded in classical fluid mechanics principles, making it implementable with standard finite-difference techniques. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by simulating the evolution of a single vesicle or droplet in Newtonian Poiseuille and Couette flows under different free-energy models, successfully recovering canonical axisymmetric shapes and stress profiles. Although this work primarily focuses on single-body dynamics in Newtonian suspending fluids, the framework can be extended to include body forces, inertial effects, and viscoelastic media."

    "abstract": "Brain networks exhibit remarkable structural properties, including high local clustering, short path lengths, and heavy-tailed weight and degree distributions. While these features are thought to enable efficient information processing with minimal wiring costs, the fundamental principles that generate such complex network architectures across species remain unclear. Here, we analyse single-neuron resolution connectomes across five species (C. Elegans, Platynereis, Drosophila M., zebrafish and mouse) to investigate the fundamental wiring principles underlying brain network formation. We show that distance-dependent connectivity alone produces small-world networks, but fails to generate heavy-tailed distributions. By incorporating weight-preferential attachment, which arises from spatial clustering of synapses along neurites, we reproduce heavy-tailed weight distributions while maintaining small-world topology. Adding degree-preferential attachment, linked to the extent of dendritic and axonal arborization, enables the generation of heavy-tailed degree distributions. Through systematic parameter exploration, we demonstrate that the combination of distance dependence, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment is sufficient to reproduce all characteristic properties of empirical brain networks. Our results reveal that activity-independent geometric constraints during neural development can account for the conserved architectural principles observed across evolutionarily distant species, suggesting universal mechanisms governing neural circuit assembly."

    "abstract": "The next generation of Earth observation satellites will seek to deploy intelligent models directly onboard the payload in order to minimize the latency incurred by the transmission and processing chain of the ground segment, for time-critical applications. Designing neural architectures for onboard execution, particularly for satellite-based hyperspectral imagers, poses novel challenges due to the unique constraints of this environment and imaging system that are largely unexplored by the traditional computer vision literature. In this paper, we show that this setting requires addressing three competing objectives, namely high-quality inference with low complexity, dynamic power scalability and fault tolerance. We focus on the problem of hyperspectral image denoising, which is a critical task to enable effective downstream inference, and highlights the constraints of the onboard processing scenario. We propose a neural network design that addresses the three aforementioned objectives with several novel contributions. In particular, we propose a mixture of denoisers that can be resilient to radiation-induced faults as well as allowing for time-varying power scaling. Moreover, each denoiser employs an innovative architecture where an image is processed line-by-line in a causal way, with a memory of past lines, in order to match the acquisition process of pushbroom hyperspectral sensors and greatly limit memory requirements. We show that the proposed architecture can run in real-time, i.e., process one line in the time it takes to acquire the next one, on low-power hardware and provide competitive denoising quality with respect to significantly more complex state-of-the-art models. We also show that the power scalability and fault tolerance objectives provide a design space with multiple tradeoffs between those properties and denoising quality."

While isotopically enriched hBN using $^{10}$B and $^{15}$N isotopes (h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N) exhibits sharper spectral features, significant inhomogeneous broadening persists. We demonstrate that, implemented via frequency modulation on an FPGA, a frequency-ramped microwave pulse achieves around 4-fold greater $|0\\rangle\\rightarrow|-1\\rangle$ spin-state population transfer and thus contrast than resonant microwave excitation and thus 16-fold shorter measurement time for spin relaxation based quantum sensing. Quantum dynamics simulations reveal that an effective two-state Landau-Zener model captures the complex relationship between population inversion and pulse length with relaxations incorporated. Our approach is robust and valuable for quantum relaxometry with spin defects in hBN in noisy environments."

This paper develops a dynamic model in which firms invest in purpose to enhance job meaning and motivate effort. Workers, who differ in productivity, choose both productive and socialization effort, gaining utility from income and meaning. Purpose accumulates over time through firm investment and interacts with socialization to generate meaning, which boosts productivity. Firms invest in purpose only insofar as it raises profits. We characterize the unique equilibrium, including steady state and transition dynamics. Meaning and purpose rise with the importance workers place on meaning and with firm's patience, but fall with depreciation and socialization costs. The relationship with workers' share of output is nonmonotonic. We also show that some intermediate level of heterogeneity in skills is best for performance. Compared to a worker-owned firm, profit-maximizing firms underinvest in purpose, highlighting a misalignment between firm incentives and worker preferences. The model provides insight into when and why firms adopt purpose-driven practices and underscores the role of diversity in fostering meaning at work."

To answer this question, we propose AlgBench, an expert-curated benchmark that evaluates LRMs under an algorithm-centric paradigm. AlgBench consists of over 3,000 original problems spanning 27 algorithms, constructed by ACM algorithmic experts and organized under a comprehensive taxonomy, including Euclidean-structured, non-Euclidean-structured, non-optimized, local-optimized, global-optimized, and heuristic-optimized categories. Empirical evaluations on leading LRMs (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro, DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale and GPT-o3) reveal substantial performance heterogeneity: while models perform well on non-optimized tasks (up to 92%), accuracy drops sharply to around 49% on globally optimized algorithms such as dynamic programming. Further analysis uncovers \\textbf{strategic over-shifts}, wherein models prematurely abandon correct algorithmic designs due to necessary low-entropy tokens. These findings expose fundamental limitations of problem-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the necessity of an algorithm-centric training paradigm for robust algorithmic reasoning."

Standard practices typically only retain trajectories with correct final answers (positives) while ignoring the rest (negatives). We argue that this paradigm discards substantial supervision and exacerbates overfitting, limiting out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Specifically, we surprisingly find that incorporating negative trajectories into SFT yields substantial OOD generalization gains over positive-only training, as these trajectories often retain valid intermediate reasoning despite incorrect final answers. To understand this effect in depth, we systematically analyze data, training dynamics, and inference behavior, identifying 22 recurring patterns in negative chains that serve a dual role: they moderate loss descent to mitigate overfitting during training and boost policy entropy by 35.67% during inference to facilitate exploration. Motivated by these observations, we further propose Gain-based LOss Weighting (GLOW), an adaptive, sample-aware scheme that exploits such distinctive training dynamics by rescaling per-sample loss based on inter-epoch progress. Empirically, GLOW efficiently leverages unfiltered trajectories, yielding a 5.51% OOD gain over positive-only SFT on Qwen2.5-7B and boosting MMLU from 72.82% to 76.47% as an RL initialization."

Post-hoc calibration aligns predicted confidence with empirical reliability and reduces miscalibration by about an order of magnitude without affecting accuracy.

However, this capability often leads to ``overthinking'', where models generate redundant reasoning paths that inflate computational costs without improving accuracy. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off. Specifically, it reduces inference length by 43% over strong baselines at the cost of a mere 0.7% dip in accuracy, proving its effectiveness in generating high-quality, efficient training data for LRMs."

As hydrogen infrastructures rapidly expand beyond their traditional applications, there is a need for comprehensive safety practices, solutions, and regulations. Within this framework, the dispersion of hydrogen in enclosed facilities presents a significant safety concern due to its potential for explosive accidents. In this study, hydrogen dispersion in a confined and congested environment (37 m${}^3$ container) is studied using computational fluid dynamics simulations. The experimental setup mirrors previous INERIS investigations, featuring a centrally located hydrogen injection point on the floor with a 20 mm diameter injector and a release rate of 35 g/s, resulting in a Froude number of 650. This yields an inertial jet and a challenging dispersion scenario for numerical prediction. Concentration mapping is carried out by 3 oxygen analyzers distributed throughout the 37 m3 chamber. Comparisons are made between the measured and numerical data to validate the solver used under such conditions. Best practice guidelines are followed, and sensitivity studies involving grid refinement and boundary conditions are conducted to ensure robust simulation results. The findings highlight the model's ability to reproduce the hydrogen concentration distribution for both empty and congested containers and underline the role of accounting for leakages in such scenarios."

However, the narrow spectral bandwidth and the requirement for an additional lens remain the key challenges. Here, we address both issues via a novel adaptive and multifunctional IR-to-visible imaging platform offering tunable bandwidth and focusing simultaneously. We utilise sum-frequency generation (SFG) to convert IR light into the visible, by introducing a pump beam modulated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) to construct a virtual metalens enabling precisely controlled focusing of the generated nonlinear optical field. As a result, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally an optical focusing mechanism with a tunable focal length, achieved by varying the pump and signal wavelengths and modulating the phase distribution. Furthermore, since the focal length depends on the input signal wavelength, the imaging plane position varies accordingly, indicating a promising potential for the multispectral IR imaging applications. Our upconversion platform delivers SLM-controlled, programmable multispectral focusing for next-generation IR imaging, opening new avenues in the fields of computational and multispectral imaging techniques."

Within an effective field theory framework, we consider two different scenarios: an axion-like particle (ALP) and a new heavy neutral vector gauge boson $Z^\\prime $, each couples to electrons only. We analyze electron-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}= 141$ GeV with an integrated luminosity of $100~{\\rm fb}^{-1}$, focusing primarily on the tri-electron final state. Additionally, loop-induced ALP-photon couplings driven photon final states are also explored.

We argue that, despite incremental progress, current approaches remain ill-suited to correcting the market failures underpinning AI-related energy use, water consumption, and material demand. Key shortcomings include narrow disclosure requirements, excessive reliance on voluntary standards, weak enforcement mechanisms, and a structural disconnect between AI-specific impacts and broader sustainability laws. The analysis situates these regulatory gaps within a wider ecosystem of academic research, civil society advocacy, standard-setting, and industry initiatives, highlighting risks of regulatory capture and greenwashing. Building on this diagnosis, the paper advances strategic recommendations for the COP30 Action Agenda, calling for binding transparency obligations, harmonized international standards for lifecycle assessment, stricter governance of data center expansion, and meaningful public participation in AI infrastructure decisions."

The ensuing phases demonstrate that the minority component is being un-trapped, partially trapped, or fully trapped by the majority droplet species. These states are characterized by their binding energies captured by the chemical potentials and their low-amplitude excitation spectrum, including mode crossings at the particle-emission threshold. We further derive effective reduced models which are valid in the high-imbalance limit, and accurately reproduce the numerically computed ground states, while providing analytical insights into the role of quantum fluctuations.

We introduce T-Retriever, a novel framework that reformulates attributed graph retrieval as tree-based retrieval using a semantic and structure-guided encoding tree. Our approach features two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Compression Encoding, which replaces artificial compression quotas with a global optimization strategy that preserves the graph's natural hierarchical organization, and (2) Semantic-Structural Entropy ($S^2$-Entropy), which jointly optimizes for both structural cohesion and semantic consistency when creating hierarchical partitions. Experiments across diverse graph reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that T-Retriever significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, providing more coherent and contextually relevant responses to complex queries."

We use this to associate to the reduced manifold or orbifold Mabuchi and Calabi functionals, as well as to obtain obstructions for the existence of solutions in terms of the authomorphism group, paralleling results by Futaki and Calabi-Lichnerowicz-Matsushima in the cscK case. This is used to characterize the Samelson locally homogeneous BHE geometries in complex dimension 3 as the only non-Kähler BHE $3$-folds with $2$-dimensional Bott-Chern $(1,1)$-cohomology group, for which the reduced space is a smooth Kähler surface. We also discuss explicit solutions of the PDE on orthotoric Kähler orbifold surfaces, extending examples found by Couzens-Gauntlett-Martelli-Sparks in the framework of supersymmetric ${\\rm AdS}_3 \\times Y_7$ type IIB supergravity. Our construction yields infinitely many non-Kähler BHE structures on $S^3\\times S^3$ and $S^1\\times S^2 \\times S^3$, which are not locally isometric to a Samelson geometry.

Turbulent convection models in nonlinear radial stellar pulsation models rely on an extra equation for turbulent kinetic energy and fail to adequately explain mode-selection problems. Since multidimensional calculations are computationally expensive, it is reasonable to search for generalizations of physically grounded 1D models that approximate multidimensional results with sufficient accuracy, at least in a given parameter range. A natural way of progressing from one-equation models is to use additional nonlocal equations. While these types of models also exist in the literature, they have not been adopted for this type of object. Aims. We aim to adapt the three-equation turbulent convection model from Kuhfuss to radial stellar pulsation modeling. Methods. We use a Reynolds-stress one-point closure approach to derive our extensions alongside the model, while using additional models from the literature to close the anisotropy and dissipation terms. Results. We provide five extensions to the original model. These include an enhanced dissipation correction to the mixing length, a local anisotropy model replacing eddy viscosity, a second-order correction for turbulent ion transport in the atmosphere (alongside opacity effects), and turbulent damping of entropy fluctuations and convective flux."

Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations comparing human-authored and LLM-generated persuasive texts. We find that although overtly persuasive LLM-generated texts can be easier to detect than human-written ones, subtle LLM-generated persuasion consistently degrades automatic detection performance.

    "abstract": "Antiferroelectrics are antipolar materials which possess an electric field-induced phase transition to a polar, ferroelectric phase and offer significant potential for sensing/actuation and energy-storage applications. Known antiferroelectrics are relatively scarce and mainly based on a limited set of perovskite materials and their alloys (e.g., PbZrO$_3$, AgNbO$_3$, NaNbO$_3$). Here, a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, identified through a large-scale, first-principles computational search is introduced. The screening methodology, which connects lattice dynamics to antipolar distortions, predicted that La$_3$NbO$_7$ could exhibit antiferroelectricity. We confirm the prediction through the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial La$_3$NbO$_7$ thin films, which display the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material as well as clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure from transmission electron microscopy. The antiferroelectricity in La$_3$NbO$_7$ is simpler than most known antiferroelectrics and can be explained by a Kittel-type mechanism involving the movement of niobium atoms in an oxygen octahedron through a single phonon mode which results in a smaller change in the volume during the field-induced phase transition. Additionally, it is found that La$_3$NbO$_7$ combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\\approx$ 6MV/cm) - which opens up opportunities for energy-storage applications. This new weberite-type family of materials offers many opportunities to tune electrical and temperature response especially through substitutions on the rare-earth site. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a successful data-driven theory-to-experiment discovery of an entirely new family of antiferroelectrics and provides a blueprint for the future design of ferroic materials."

As a consequence, up to an exponentially small residual term, the error of best network approximation on generic target functions is bounded from below by the error of best polynomial approximation. In particular, networks with analytic activation functions with controlled coefficients cannot outperform classical polynomial approximation rates on non-analytic targets. The underlying rigidity phenomenon extends to smoother, non-analytic activations satisfying Gevrey-type regularity assumptions, yielding sub-exponential variants of the approximation barrier. The analysis is entirely deterministic and relies on a comparison argument combined with classical Bernstein-type estimates; extensions to higher dimensions are also discussed."

This copula process, defined on the covariate space, can be paired with any marginal distribution for the dependent variable to construct a flexible distributional BART model. Bayesian inference is performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo on an augmented posterior, where we show that key sampling steps can be realized as those of Chipman et al. (2010), preserving scalability and computational efficiency even though the copula process is high dimensional. The posterior predictive distribution from the copula process model is derived in closed form as the push-forward of the posterior predictive distribution of the underlying BART model with an optimal transport map. Under suitable conditions, we establish posterior consistency for the regression function and posterior means and prove convergence in distribution of the predictive process and conditional expectation. Simulation studies demonstrate improved accuracy of distributional predictions compared to the original BART model and leading benchmarks. Applications to five real datasets with 506 to 515,345 observations and 8 to 90 covariates further highlight the efficacy and scalability of our proposed BART copula process model."

    "abstract": "Collaborative training of a machine learning model comes with a risk of sharing sensitive or private data. Federated learning offers a way of collectively training a single global model without the need to share client data, by sharing only the updated parameters from each client's local model. A central server is then used to aggregate parameters from all clients and redistribute the aggregated model back to the clients. Recent findings have shown that even in this scenario, private data can be reconstructed only using information about model parameters. Current efforts to mitigate this are mainly focused on reducing privacy risks on the server side, assuming that other clients will not act maliciously. In this work, we analyzed various methods for improving the privacy of client data concerning both the server and other clients for neural networks. Some of these methods include homomorphic encryption, gradient compression, gradient noising, and discussion on possible usage of modified federated learning systems such as split learning, swarm learning or fully encrypted models. We have analyzed the negative effects of gradient compression and gradient noising on the accuracy of convolutional neural networks used for classification. We have shown the difficulty of data reconstruction in the case of segmentation networks. We have also implemented a proof of concept on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module used in edge devices and simulated a federated learning process."

Documents are first represented as structured belief sets and aggregated using distance-based belief merging operators that explicitly model conflict. Large language models are then used only to realise the aggregated beliefs as natural language summaries. We evaluate the approach across multiple model families and scales, comparing it to methods that perform explicit aggregation during generation. Our results show that while sufficiently large models can match belief-level aggregation when aggregation is handled at generation time, this behaviour is not stable across architectures or capacities. In contrast, belief-level aggregation combined with simple prompting yields consistently strong disagreement-aware performance across models, while maintaining fluent and grounded summaries."

Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario. We demonstrate our method in a real-world case study of replanning trains in the densely-used Dutch railway network. Our experiments show that FlexSIPP provides effective solutions, relevant to real-world adjustments, and within a reasonable timeframe."

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a \"teacherless\" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods."

To address this, we introduce EvolSQL, a structure-aware data synthesis framework that evolves SQL queries from seed data into richer and more semantically diverse forms. EvolSQL starts with an exploratory Query-SQL expansion to broaden question diversity and improve schema coverage, and then applies an adaptive directional evolution strategy using six atomic transformation operators derived from the SQL Abstract Syntax Tree to progressively increase query complexity across relational, predicate, aggregation, and nesting dimensions. An execution-grounded SQL refinement module and schema-aware deduplication further ensure the creation of high-quality, structurally diverse mapping pairs.

Here, we build on previous work and present a framework for modelling flanger, chorus and phaser effects based on differentiable digital signal processing. The model is trained in the time-frequency domain, but at inference operates in the time-domain, requiring zero latency. We investigate the challenges associated with gradient-based optimisation of such effects, and show that low-frequency weighting of loss functions avoids convergence to local minima when learning delay times.

    "abstract": "Rotatable antenna (RA) technology can harness additional spatial degrees of freedom by enabling the dynamic three-dimensional orientation control of each antenna. Unfortunately, the hardware cost and control complexity of traditional RA systems is proportional to the number of RAs. To address the issue, we consider a cross-linked (CL) RA structure, which enables the coordinated rotation of multiple antennas, thereby offering a cost-effective solution. To evaluate the performance of the CL-RA array, we investigate a CL-RA-aided uplink system. Specifically, we first establish system models for both antenna element-level and antenna panel-level rotation. Then, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming at the base station and the rotation angles. For the antenna element-level rotation, we derive the optimal solution of the CL-RA array under the single-user case. Subsequently, for two rotation schemes, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem in the multi-user case, where the receive beamforming and the antenna rotation angles are obtained by applying the minimum mean square error method and feasible direction method, respectively. In addition, considering the hardware limitations, we apply the genetic algorithm to address the discrete rotation angles selection problem. Simulation results show that by carefully designing the row-column partition scheme, the performance of the CL-RA architecture is quite close to that of the flexible antenna orientation scheme. Moreover, the CL antenna element-level scheme surpasses the CL antenna panel-level scheme by 25% and delivers a 128% performance improvement over conventional fixed-direction antennas."

    "abstract": "Cross-domain misinformation detection is challenging, as misinformation arises across domains with substantial differences in knowledge and discourse. Existing methods often rely on single-perspective cues and struggle to generalize to challenging or underrepresented domains, while reasoning large language models (LLMs), though effective on complex tasks, are limited to same-distribution data. To address these gaps, we introduce RAAR, the first retrieval-augmented agentic reasoning framework for cross-domain misinformation detection. To enable cross-domain transfer beyond same-distribution assumptions, RAAR retrieves multi-perspective source-domain evidence aligned with each target sample's semantics, sentiment, and writing style. To overcome single-perspective modeling and missing systematic reasoning, RAAR constructs verifiable multi-step reasoning paths through specialized multi-agent collaboration, where perspective-specific agents produce complementary analyses and a summary agent integrates them under verifier guidance. RAAR further applies supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to train a single multi-task verifier to enhance verification and reasoning capabilities. Based on RAAR, we trained the RAAR-8b and RAAR-14b models. Evaluation on three cross-domain misinformation detection tasks shows that RAAR substantially enhances the capabilities of the base models and outperforms other cross-domain methods, advanced LLMs, and LLM-based adaptation approaches. The project will be released at https://github.com/lzw108/RAAR."

In this paper, we consider the inherent problem stems from the prior knowledge about the signal's structure, such as sparsity which is critical for signal recovery models. We investigate three constrained optimization models that effectively address this challenge, each leveraging distinct forms of structural priors to regularize the solution space. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that these models exhibit robustness to noise while maintaining stability with respect to tuning parameters that is a crucial property for practical applications, when the parameter selection is often nontrivial. By providing theoretical foundations, our work supports their practical use in scenarios where measurement imperfections and model uncertainties are unavoidable. Furthermore, under mild conditions, we establish tradeoff between the sample complexity and the mismatch error."

Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable. We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window. Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony. Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties. These results position PoCmt as a new point in the consensus design space, grounding permissionless security in sustained human effort rather than computation or capital."

Maximum Likelihood is a supervised classification algorithm which is based on the Classical Bayes theorem.

Class means vector and covariance matrix are the key inputs to the function and can be estimated from training pixels of a particular class. As Maximum Likelihood need some assumptions before it has to be applied on the data. In this paper we will compare the results of Maximum Likelihood Classification (ML) before apply the Weierstrass Transform and apply Weierstrass Transform and will see the difference between the accuracy on training pixels of high resolution Quickbird satellite image. Principle Component analysis (PCA) is also used for dimension reduction and also used to check the variation in bands. The results shows that the separation between mean of the classes in the decision space is to be the main factor that leads to the high classification accuracy of Maximum Likelihood (ML) after using Weierstrass Transform than without using it."

However, in node classification, computing node-level explainability becomes extremely time-consuming as the size of the graph increases, while batching strategies often degrade explanation quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning. By decomposing the graph into disjoint subgraphs, we enable parallel computation of explainability for node neighbors, significantly improving the scalability and efficiency without affecting the correctness of the results, provided sufficient memory is available. For scenarios where memory is limited, we further propose a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism that offers a controllable trade-off between memory usage and explanation fidelity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial speedups, enabling scalable and transparent explainability for large-scale GNN models."

To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal predictive model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art work ProgSG by up to 10.25$\\times$. Furthermore, in DSE tasks, the proposed LLM4DSE achieves an average performance gain of 39.90\\% over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of our prompting methodology.

This experiment tested the Kinetic Impactor technology for diverting dangerous asteroids. Due to the impact, the binary system's angular momentum has changed, resulting in a significant change in the orbital period of Dimorphos. Precise values of the pre- and post-impact orbital periods were derived from a large set of photometric light curves measured for the Didymos-Dimorphos system during six apparitions from 2003 to 2023. We used these data to detect a possible change in the rotation period of the primary as a consequence of the impact. We analyzed the binary system's light curves using the binary asteroid light curve decomposition method. We selected parts of the light curves covering orbital phases outside mutual events, which represent the primary rotational light curves. We applied the light curve inversion method to construct a convex shape model of Didymos and determine its rotation period before and after the impact. These two periods were treated as independent free parameters of the modeling. We found a value of 2.2603891 +/- 0.0000002 h for the pre-impact period and 2.260440 +/- 0.000008 h for the post-impact period. Their difference 0.18 +/- 0.03 s is small yet significant, indicating that the rotation of Didymos became slower after the DART impact. The most plausible physical explanation is Didymos's post-impact reshaping, making its shape more oblate."

Sampling along randomly chosen branches defines a homogeneous Markov chain, enabling a stochastic characterization of extended self-similarity and intermittency through the spectral properties of the associated Feynman-Kac operators. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions, showing that multi-branch shell models offer a minimal yet physically rich framework for exploring the complexity of nonlinear energy transfer across scales."

In this study, we propose an enhanced Pix2Pix framework that integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual Networks (SEResNet) and U-Net++ to improve image generation quality and structural fidelity. SEResNet strengthens critical feature representation through channel attention, while U-Net++ enhances multi-scale feature fusion. A simplified PatchGAN discriminator further stabilizes training and refines local anatomical realism. Experimental results demonstrate that under few-shot conditions with fewer than 500 images, the proposed method achieves consistent structural fidelity and superior image quality across multiple intra-modality MRI translation tasks, showing strong generalization ability.

Therefore, we propose GeM-VG, an MLLM capable of Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding. To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths. This strategy adopts an R1-like algorithm guided by a carefully designed rule-based reward, effectively enhancing the model's overall perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalized grounding capabilities of our model. For multi-image grounding, it outperforms the previous leading MLLMs by 2.0% and 9.7% on MIG-Bench and MC-Bench, respectively. In single-image grounding, it achieves a 9.1% improvement over the base model on ODINW. Furthermore, our model retains strong capabilities in general multi-image understanding."

AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline.

Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively.

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for spatiotemporal photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting and use it to evaluate the reliability, sharpness, and overall performance of seven intraday PV power nowcasting models. The model suite includes satellite-based deep learning and optical-flow approaches and physics-based numerical weather prediction models, covering both deterministic and probabilistic formulations. Forecasts are first validated against satellite-derived surface solar irradiance (SSI). Irradiance fields are then converted into PV power using station-specific machine learning models, enabling comparison with production data from 6434 PV stations across Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate spatiotemporal PV forecasting at a national scale. We additionally provide the first visualizations of how mesoscale cloud systems shape national PV production on hourly and sub-hourly timescales. Our results show that satellite-based approaches outperform the Integrated Forecast System (IFS-ENS), particularly at short lead times. Among them, SolarSTEPS and SHADECast deliver the most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing the most reliable ensemble spread. The deterministic model IrradianceNet achieves the lowest root mean square error, while probabilistic forecasts of SolarSTEPS and SHADECast provide better-calibrated uncertainty. Forecast skill generally decreases with elevation. At a national scale, satellite-based models forecast the daily total PV generation with relative errors below 10% for 82% of the days in 2019-2020, demonstrating robustness and their potential for operational use."

    "abstract": "We study the mass-conserved reaction-diffusion system known as the wave-pinning model, which serves as a minimal framework for describing cell polarity. In this model, the interplay between reaction kinetics and slow diffusion forms a sharp interface that partitions the domain into high- and low-concentration regions. We perform a detailed asymptotic analysis and derive higher-order approximation equations governing the motion of this interface. Our results show that on a fast timescale, the interface evolves via propagating front dynamics, whereas on a slow timescale, it evolves as an area-preserving mean curvature flow. Furthermore, using the derived free boundary problem, we demonstrate that on a significantly slower timescale, an interface whose endpoints lie on the domain boundary drifts along the boundary toward regions of higher curvature. In summary, our analysis reveals that the interface dynamics in the wave-pinning model exhibit a hierarchy of three distinct timescales: wave propagation on a fast timescale, curvature-driven area-preserving evolution on a slow timescale, and motion along the boundary on a significantly slower timescale."

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) systems have attracted renewed interest within the scientific community due to their anomalous dynamical behaviors, which arise from long-wavelength density fluctuations as predicted by the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) theorem. In equilibrium, it is well established that continuous spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in 2D is prohibited at any finite temperature ($T > 0$), resulting in the absence of true long-range positional order and establishing $d_l = 2$ as the lower critical dimension. Recent studies have demonstrated that, in active systems, the lower critical dimension can shift from $d_l = 2$ to $3$. This study examines the impact of MWH theorem violation in active systems on dynamical heterogeneity (DH). As a minimal model, glassy systems of active particles undergoing run-and-tumble (RT) motion are considered. Glass-like dynamical behavior, including anomalously enhanced DH, is observed in various biological systems such as collective cell migration, bacterial cytoplasm, and ant colonies. Furthermore, the study investigates the influence of local positional order, or medium-range crystalline order (MRCO), on DH in the presence of activity. The results indicate that the growth of DH with increasing activity differs significantly between systems with and without MRCO. These findings may have important implications, as many biological systems exhibit local structural ordering, and DH could serve as a useful indicator for quantifying the degree of ordering."

We find that character counts are represented on low-dimensional curved manifolds discretized by sparse feature families, analogous to biological place cells. Accurate predictions emerge from a sequence of geometric transformations: token lengths are accumulated into character count manifolds, attention heads twist these manifolds to estimate distance to the line boundary, and the decision to break the line is enabled by arranging estimates orthogonally to create a linear decision boundary. We validate our findings through causal interventions and discover visual illusions--character sequences that hijack the counting mechanism. Our work demonstrates the rich sensory processing of early layers, the intricacy of attention algorithms, and the importance of combining feature-based and geometric views of interpretability."

Using the high-purity lexicons generated by SampoNLP for Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BPE tokenizers across a range of vocabulary sizes (8k-256k). We propose a unified metric, the Integrated Performance Score (IPS), to navigate the trade-off between morpheme coverage and over-splitting. By analyzing the IPS curves, we identify the \"elbow points\" of diminishing returns and provide the first empirically grounded recommendations for optimal vocabulary sizes (k) in these languages. Our study not only offers practical guidance but also quantitatively demonstrates the limitations of standard BPE for highly agglutinative languages.

Their optical spectra can be identified by strong emission-line signatures (broad and/or narrow lines). Those showing only narrow lines are classified as 'Type 2' AGN. Extensive surveys like SDSS cover AGN in the Northern Sky, but the equivalent coverage in the Southern Sky remains limited. We address this by presenting a new catalogue of Type 2 AGN from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), which has 136,304 spectra covering roughly 17{,}000~\\mathrm{deg}^2, mainly of low-redshift galaxies. We use a median absolute deviation cut on the continuum-fitted spectrum to select emission line galaxies. AGN were identified by fitting the 6dFGS spectra with a modified Python QSO fitting tool (PyQSOFit). All selected spectra were visually inspected and corrected for fitting errors where necessary. 10,492 narrow emission line galaxies were identified in 6dFGS, including 5000 Type 2 AGN classified from Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich (BPT) diagram.

Existing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) alignment methods are largely developed for single-turn visual question-answer (VQA) task and often require costly manual preference annotations, limiting their effectiveness and scalability in dialogues. To address this challenge, we present InterSafe-V, an open-source multi-modal dialogue dataset containing 11,270 dialogues and 500 specially designed refusal VQA samples. This dataset, constructed through interaction between several models, is designed to more accurately reflect real-world scenarios and includes specialized VQA pairs tailored for specific domains. Building on this dataset, we propose AM$^3$Safety, a framework that combines a cold-start refusal phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning using turn-aware dual-objective rewards across entire dialogues. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and LLaVA-NeXT-7B show more than 10\\% decrease in Attack Success Rate (ASR) together with an increment of at least 8\\% in harmless dimension and over 13\\% in helpful dimension of MLLMs on multi-modal multi-turn safety benchmarks, while preserving their general abilities."

    "abstract": "Root cause analysis in modern cloud infrastructure demands sophisticated understanding of heterogeneous data sources, particularly time-series performance metrics that involve core failure signatures. While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textual reasoning, their discrete token-based architecture creates fundamental incompatibilities with continuous numerical sequences exhibiting temporal dependencies. Current methodologies inadequately address this modality mismatch, constraining the potential of language model-driven automation in incident management workflows. This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes. The results validate embedding-space alignment as an effective strategy for enabling language models to reason over multimodal telemetry data in production incident response contexts."

    "abstract": "Infrared video has been of great interest in visual tasks under challenging environments, but often suffers from severe atmospheric turbulence and compression degradation. Existing video super-resolution (VSR) methods either neglect the inherent modality gap between infrared and visible images or fail to restore turbulence-induced distortions. Directly cascading turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms with VSR methods leads to error propagation and accumulation due to the decoupled modeling of degradation between turbulence and resolution. We introduce HATIR, a Heat-Aware Diffusion for Turbulent InfraRed Video Super-Resolution, which injects heat-aware deformation priors into the diffusion sampling path to jointly model the inverse process of turbulent degradation and structural detail loss. Specifically, HATIR constructs a Phasor-Guided Flow Estimator, rooted in the physical principle that thermally active regions exhibit consistent phasor responses over time, enabling reliable turbulence-aware flow to guide the reverse diffusion process. To ensure the fidelity of structural recovery under nonuniform distortions, a Turbulence-Aware Decoder is proposed to selectively suppress unstable temporal cues and enhance edge-aware feature aggregation via turbulence gating and structure-aware attention. We built FLIR-IVSR, the first dataset for turbulent infrared VSR, comprising paired LR-HR sequences from a FLIR T1050sc camera (1024 X 768) spanning 640 diverse scenes with varying camera and object motion conditions. This encourages future research in infrared VSR. Project page: https://github.com/JZ0606/HATIR"

The study then explores DRL approaches, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which demonstrate improved adaptability and performance in two-dimensional simulations. Enhancements such as Double Q-Networks and Dueling Networks are evaluated to further improve decision-making.

Experiments conducted in a three-dimensional environment using ROS and Gazebo demonstrate the effectiveness of continuous DRL algorithms in navigating dynamic agricultural scenarios. Notably, the pretrained TD3 agent achieves a 95 percent success rate in dynamic environments, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach in handling moving obstacles while ensuring safety for both crops and the robot."

By irradiating silicon through a mask with a broad beam of nitrogen ions, we realized lamellar gratings in a precise and well controlled process. We were able to fabricate gratings with structure heights between (1.00 +/- 0.05) nm to (10.0 +/- 0.5) nm and a pitch of 1 micrometre, which is suitable for both EUV and soft X-ray applications.

    "abstract": "Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a pivotal role in ensuring seamless connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly in scenarios where conventional terrestrial networks are constrained or temporarily unavailable. However, traditional coverage-hole detection approaches, such as minimizing drive tests, are costly, time-consuming, and reliant on outdated radio-environment data, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a UAV-assisted framework for real-time detection and recovery of coverage holes in IoT networks. In the proposed scheme, a patrol UAV is first dispatched to identify coverage holes in regions where the operational status of terrestrial base stations (BSs) is uncertain. Once a coverage hole is detected, one or more UAVs acting as aerial BSs are deployed by a satellite or nearby operational BSs to restore connectivity. The UAV swarm is organized based on Delaunay triangulation, enabling scalable deployment and tractable analytical characterization using stochastic geometry. Moreover, a collision-avoidance mechanism grounded in multi-agent system theory ensures safe and coordinated motion among multiple UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high efficiency in both coverage-hole detection and on-demand connectivity restoration while significantly reducing operational cost and time."

In addition, we impose the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty on the SQVAR model to mitigate the explosive nature of the parameter space. We further develop a Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based procedure for selecting the optimal penalty parameter and introduce new frameworks for impulse response analysis of QVAR models. Finally, we establish asymptotic properties of the proposed method, including the convergence rate and asymptotic normality of the estimator, the consistency of AR order selection, and the validity of the BIC-based penalty selection. For illustration, we apply the proposed method to U.S. financial market data, highlighting the usefulness of our SQVAR method."

For mass ratios much greater than 1 we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the scattering length and the effective range of the dimer-wall collision both depend logarithmically on the mass ratio. For collision energies much greater than the binding energy, the dissociation probability is inversely proportional to the square of the incident momentum of the dimer and we find the constant of proportionality analytically, and we use a semiclassical analysis to approximately derive the ``angular distribution\" of the dissociated pair, where the ``angle\" $θ$ depends on the ratio of the velocities of the two outgoing unbound particles."

To address this, we propose LAMB, an LLM-based audio captioning framework that bridges the modality gap between audio embeddings and the LLM text embedding space. LAMB incorporates a Cross-Modal Aligner that minimizes Cauchy-Schwarz divergence while maximizing mutual information, yielding tighter alignment between audio and text at both global and token levels. We further design a Two-Stream Adapter that extracts semantically enriched audio embeddings, thereby delivering richer information to the Cross-Modal Aligner. Finally, leveraging the aligned audio embeddings, a proposed Token Guide directly computes scores within the LLM text embedding space to steer the output logits of generated captions. Experimental results confirm that our framework strengthens the reasoning capabilities of the LLM decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AudioCaps."

The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content. Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited. We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance. This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content. By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6\\% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines. We also confirm that the curriculum training contributes to the efficiency of both transcription and censorship tasks."

This paper introduces Limited Math (LM), a bounded semantic framework that aligns mathematical reasoning with finite computation. Limited Math makes constraints on numeric magnitude, numeric precision, and structural complexity explicit and foundational. A finite numeric domain parameterized by a single bound \\(M\\) is equipped with a deterministic value-mapping operator that enforces quantization and explicit boundary behavior. Functions and operators retain their classical mathematical interpretation and are mapped into the bounded domain only at a semantic boundary, separating meaning from bounded evaluation. Within representable bounds, LM coincides with classical arithmetic; when bounds are exceeded, deviations are explicit, deterministic, and analyzable. By additionally bounding set cardinality, LM prevents implicit infinitary behavior from re-entering through structural constructions. As a consequence, computations realized under LM induce finite-state semantic models, providing a principled foundation for reasoning about arithmetic, structure, and execution in finite computational settings."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for analyzing social phenomena at scale. This paper demonstrates the value of LLMs in psychological measurement by (1) compiling the first large-scale dataset of election rumors on a niche alt-tech platform, (2) developing a multistage Rumor Detection Agent that leverages LLMs for high-precision content classification, and (3) quantifying the psychological dynamics of rumor propagation, specifically the \"illusory truth effect\" in a naturalistic setting. The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become \"infected\" within just four propagation iterations. Taken together, these results illustrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling the rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in massive, real-world datasets."

Bridge documents are those that contribute to the reasoning process yet are not directly relevant to the initial query. While existing reasoning-based reranker pipelines attempt to surface these documents in ranking, they suffer from bounded recall. Naive solution with adaptive retrieval into these pipelines often leads to planning error propagation. To address this, we propose REPAIR, a framework that bridges this gap by repurposing reasoning plans as dense feedback signals for adaptive retrieval. Our key distinction is enabling mid-course correction during reranking through selective adaptive retrieval, retrieving documents that support the pivotal plan. Experimental results on reasoning-intensive retrieval and complex QA tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines by 5.6%pt."

    "abstract": "We study U.S. Treasury yield curve forecasting under distributional uncertainty and recast forecasting as an operations research and managerial decision problem. Rather than minimizing average forecast error, the forecaster selects a decision rule that minimizes worst case expected loss over an ambiguity set of forecast error distributions. To this end, we propose a distributionally robust ensemble forecasting framework that integrates parametric factor models with high dimensional nonparametric machine learning models through adaptive forecast combinations. The framework consists of three machine learning components. First, a rolling window Factor Augmented Dynamic Nelson Siegel model captures level, slope, and curvature dynamics using principal components extracted from economic indicators. Second, Random Forest models capture nonlinear interactions among macro financial drivers and lagged Treasury yields. Third, distributionally robust forecast combination schemes aggregate heterogeneous forecasts under moment uncertainty, penalizing downside tail risk via expected shortfall and stabilizing second moment estimation through ridge regularized covariance matrices. The severity of the worst case criterion is adjustable, allowing the forecaster to regulate the trade off between robustness and statistical efficiency. Using monthly data, we evaluate out of sample forecasts across maturities and horizons from one to twelve months ahead. Adaptive combinations deliver superior performance at short horizons, while Random Forest forecasts dominate at longer horizons. Extensions to global sovereign bond yields confirm the stability and generalizability of the proposed framework."

Through the strategic adjustment of the input admittance, the conductance of the low-power diode decreases progressively with increasing power, while the conductance of the high-power diode increases correspondingly. This conductance-based power allocation method ensures that the power is rectified consistently by the most appropriate diode, regardless of the power level, and, thus, enables efficient rectification across an extended range. This letter presents a rectifier typology to substantiate the proposed strategy. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the adaptive power division strategy, with the rectifier showing efficiency in excess of 60% from 5 to 29.5 dBm, giving a power dynamic range of 24.5 dB."

    "abstract": "Compressible direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flows in concentric annular ducts of height $2δ$ are performed to study the low-wavenumber wall pressure fluctuations (WPF) over cylindrical walls at a bulk Mach number $M_b = 0.4$ and bulk Reynolds number $Re_b=3000$. The radius of the inner cylinder $R$ is varied between $0.2δ$, $δ$, $2δ$ and $\\infty$. As $R$ decreases, the one-point power spectral density of the WPF decreases at intermediate but increases at high frequencies. When $R$ decreases, the 1D (streamwise) wavenumber-frequency spectrum of the WPF decreases at high wavenumbers. At low wavenumbers, however, as $R$ reduces to $0.2δ$ the 1D wavenumber-frequency spectrum exhibits multiple spectral peaks whose strengths increase with frequency. Examination of the 2D wavenumber-frequency spectra shows that these represent acoustic duct modes that closely match theoretical predictions. The acoustic modes of higher radial orders exhibit increasingly high amplitude on the inner than on the outer walls. The low-wavenumber components of the $0$th-order (azimuthal) 2D wavenumber-frequency spectrum are of great importance in practice, and their magnitude increases as $R$ reduces; this increase is increasingly pronounced at higher frequencies. Analytical modelling and numerical validation show that this increase appears to arise from the ``geometric'' effects connected with the Green's function, and they are generated mainly by radial and azimuthal disturbances. Disturbances closer to the wall are shown to be increasingly important in WPF generation as $R$ reduces, which highlights a potential in WPF control using wall treatment on thin cylinders."

While existing surveys address isolated aspects, such as data governance, service orchestration, and knowledge representation, none provides a holistic, cross-layer perspective on trustworthiness tailored to industrial settings. To bridge this gap, we present \\textsc{Trisk} (TRusted Industrial Data-Service-Knowledge governance), a novel conceptual and taxonomic framework for trustworthy industrial intelligence. Grounded in a five-dimensional trust model (quality, security, privacy, fairness, and explainability), \\textsc{Trisk} unifies 120+ representative studies along three orthogonal axes: governance scope (data, service, and knowledge), architectural paradigm (centralized, federated, or edge-embedded), and enabling technology (knowledge graphs, zero-trust policies, causal inference, etc.). We systematically analyze how trust propagates across digital layers, identify critical gaps in semantic interoperability, runtime policy enforcement, and operational/information technologies alignment, and evaluate the maturity of current industrial implementations. Finally, we articulate a forward-looking research agenda for Industry 5.0, advocating for an integrated governance fabric that embeds verifiable trust semantics into every layer of the industrial intelligence stack. This survey serves as both a foundational reference for researchers and a practical roadmap for engineers to deploy trustworthy AI in complex and multi-stakeholder environments."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks, but the complex mechanisms underlying their large-scale neurons remain opaque, posing significant challenges for understanding and steering LLMs. While recent studies made progress on identifying responsible neurons for certain abilities, these ability-specific methods are infeasible for task-focused scenarios requiring coordinated use of multiple abilities. Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization."

In this paper we construct the pinned half-space Airy line ensemble $\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathrm{hs}; \\infty}$ on $[0,\\infty)$ -- a natural half-space analogue of the Airy line ensemble -- expected to arise as the universal scaling limit of supercritical half-space KPZ models.

We show that $\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathrm{hs}; \\infty}$ has a Pfaffian point process structure with an explicit correlation kernel and that, after a parabolic shift, it satisfies a one-sided Brownian Gibbs property described by pairwise pinned Brownian motions. Far from the origin, $\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathrm{hs}; \\infty}$ converges to the standard Airy line ensemble, while at the origin its distribution coincides with that of the ordered eigenvalues (with doubled multiplicity) of the stochastic Airy operator with $β= 4$."

However, for adaptation, a critical activity during code reuse, there is no benchmark to assess LLMs' performance, leaving their practical utility in this area unclear. To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives. It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions. We hope AdaptEval can facilitate further investigation and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in code snippet adaptation, supporting their real-world applications."

An aspect of these analyses is determining which receptors expand or contract statistically significantly as a function of an exogenous perturbation such as therapeutic intervention. We characterize the commonly used Fisher's exact test approach for such analyses and propose an alternative formulation that does not necessitate pairwise, within-patient comparisons. We develop this flexible Bayesian longitudinal mixture model that accommodates variable length patient followup and handles missingness where present, not omitting data in estimation because of structural practicalities. Once clones are partitioned by the model into dynamic (expanding or contracting) and static categories, one can associate their counts or other characteristics with disease state, interventions, baseline biomarkers, and patient prognosis. We apply these developments to a cohort of prostate cancer patients who underwent randomized metastasis-directed therapy or not. Our analyses reveal a significant increase in clonal expansions among MDT patients and their association with later progressions both independent and within strata of MDT. Analysis of receptor motifs and VJ gene enrichment combinations using a high-dimensional penalized log-linear model we develop also suggests distinct biological characteristics of expanding clones, with and without inducement by MDT."

    "abstract": "Recent facial texture generation methods prefer to use deep networks to synthesize image content and then fill in the UV map, thus generating a compelling full texture from a single image. Nevertheless, the synthesized texture UV map usually comes from a space constructed by the training data or the 2D face generator, which limits the methods' generalization ability for in-the-wild input images. Consequently, their facial details, structures and identity may not be consistent with the input. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a style transfer-based facial texture refinement method named FaceRefiner. FaceRefiner treats the 3D sampled texture as style and the output of a texture generation method as content. The photo-realistic style is then expected to be transferred from the style image to the content image. Different from current style transfer methods that only transfer high and middle level information to the result, our style transfer method integrates differentiable rendering to also transfer low level (or pixel level) information in the visible face regions. The main benefit of such multi-level information transfer is that, the details, structures and semantics in the input can thus be well preserved. The extensive experiments on Multi-PIE, CelebA and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that our refinement method can improve the texture quality and the face identity preserving ability, compared with state-of-the-arts."

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) enables accurate and fast molecular property predictions, which are of interest in drug discovery and material design. Their success is based on the principle of similarity at its heart, assuming that similar molecules exhibit close properties. However, activity cliffs challenge this principle, and their presence leads to a sharp decline in the performance of existing ML algorithms, particularly graph-based methods. To overcome this obstacle under a low-data scenario, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) method dubbed SemiMol, which employs predictions on numerous unannotated data as pseudo-signals for subsequent training. Specifically, we introduce an additional instructor model to evaluate the accuracy and trustworthiness of proxy labels because existing pseudo-labeling approaches require probabilistic outputs to reveal the model's confidence and fail to be applied in regression tasks. Moreover, we design a self-adaptive curriculum learning algorithm to progressively move the target model toward hard samples at a controllable pace. Extensive experiments on 30 activity cliff datasets demonstrate that SemiMol significantly enhances graph-based ML architectures and outpasses state-of-the-art pretraining and SSL baselines."

    "abstract": "Therapeutic peptides show promise in targeting previously undruggable binding sites, with recent advancements in deep generative models enabling full-atom peptide co-design for specific protein receptors. However, the critical role of molecular surfaces in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has been underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an omni-design peptides generation paradigm, called SurfFlow, a novel surface-based generative algorithm that enables comprehensive co-design of sequence, structure, and surface for peptides. SurfFlow employs a multi-modality conditional flow matching (CFM) architecture to learn distributions of surface geometries and biochemical properties, enhancing peptide binding accuracy. Evaluated on the comprehensive PepMerge benchmark, SurfFlow consistently outperforms full-atom baselines across all metrics. These results highlight the advantages of considering molecular surfaces in de novo peptide discovery and demonstrate the potential of integrating multiple protein modalities for more effective therapeutic peptide discovery."

    "abstract": "This work introduces StageSAT, a new approach to solving floating-point satisfiability that bridges SMT solving with numerical optimization. StageSAT reframes a floating-point formula as a series of optimization problems in three stages of increasing precision. It begins with a fast, projection-aided descent objective to guide the search toward a feasible region, proceeding to bit-level accuracy with ULP$^2$ optimization and a final $n$-ULP lattice refinement. By construction, the final stage uses a representing function that is zero if and only if a candidate satisfies all constraints. Thus, when optimization drives the objective to zero, the resulting assignment is a valid solution, providing a built-in guarantee of soundness. To improve search, StageSAT introduces a partial monotone descent property on linear constraints via orthogonal projection, preventing the optimizer from stalling on flat or misleading landscapes. Critically, this solver requires no heavy bit-level reasoning or specialized abstractions; it treats complex arithmetic as a black-box, using runtime evaluations to navigate the input space. We implement StageSAT and evaluate it on extensive benchmarks, including SMT-COMP'25 suites and difficult cases from prior work. StageSAT proved more scalable and accurate than state-of-the-art optimization-based alternatives. It solved strictly more formulas than any competing solver under the same time budget, finding most satisfiable instances without producing spurious models. This amounts to 99.4% recall on satisfiable cases with 0% false SAT, exceeding the reliability of prior optimization-based solvers. StageSAT also delivered significant speedups (often 5--10$\\times$) over traditional bit-precise SMT and numeric solvers. These results demonstrate that staged optimization significantly improves performance and correctness of floating-point satisfiability solving."

    "abstract": "The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving, driven by increased digitalization and new cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity programs often fail to equip graduates with skills demanded by the workforce, particularly concerning recent developments in cybersecurity, as curriculum design is costly and labor-intensive. To address this misalignment, we present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for automated design and analysis of cybersecurity curricula, called CurricuLLM. Our approach provides three key contributions: (1) automation of personalized curriculum design, (2) a data-driven pipeline aligned with industry demands, and (3) a comprehensive methodology for leveraging fine-tuned LLMs in curriculum development. CurricuLLM utilizes a two-tier approach consisting of PreprocessLM, which standardizes input data, and ClassifyLM, which assigns course content to nine Knowledge Areas in cybersecurity. We systematically evaluated multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and fine-tuning strategies, ultimately selecting the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model as ClassifyLM, fine-tuned on foundational cybersecurity concepts and workforce competencies. We are the first to validate our method with human experts who analyzed real-world cybersecurity curricula and frameworks, motivating that CurricuLLM is an efficient solution to replace labor-intensive curriculum analysis. Moreover, once course content has been classified, it can be integrated with established cybersecurity role-based weights, enabling alignment of the educational program with specific job roles, workforce categories, or general market needs. This lays the foundation for personalized, workforce-aligned cybersecurity curricula that prepare students for the evolving demands in cybersecurity."

Given a monocular video of a dynamic object, our model reconstructs the object's complete 3D shape and motion, represented as a deformation field. Our key contribution is a compact latent space that encodes the entire animation sequence in a single pass. This latent space is learned by an autoencoder that, during training, is guided by the skeletal structure of the training objects, providing strong priors on plausible deformations. Crucially, skeletal information is not required at inference time. The encoder employs spatio-temporal attention, yielding a more stable representation of the object's overall deformation. Building on this representation, we train a latent diffusion model that, conditioned on the input video and the mesh reconstructed from the first frame, predicts the full animation in one shot. We evaluate Mesh4D on reconstruction and novel view synthesis benchmarks, outperforming prior methods in recovering accurate 3D shape and deformation."

In this work, we present CorDex, a framework that robustly learns dexterous functional grasps of novel objects from synthetic data generated from just a single human demonstration. At the core of our approach is a correspondence-based data engine that generates diverse, high-quality training data in simulation. Based on the human demonstration, our data engine generates diverse object instances of the same category, transfers the expert grasp to the generated objects through correspondence estimation, and adapts the grasp through optimization. Building on the generated data, we introduce a multimodal prediction network that integrates visual and geometric information. By devising a local-global fusion module and an importance-aware sampling mechanism, we enable robust and computationally efficient prediction of functional dexterous grasps. Through extensive experiments across various object categories, we demonstrate that CorDex generalizes well to unseen object instances and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "As language models become increasingly capable, users expect them to provide not only accurate responses but also behaviors aligned with diverse human preferences across a variety of scenarios. To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure. We then introduce Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new policy optimization method to resolve these issues by decoupling the normalization of individual rewards, more faithfully preserving their relative differences and enabling more accurate multi-reward optimization, along with substantially improved training stability. We compare GDPO with GRPO across three tasks: tool calling, math reasoning, and coding reasoning, evaluating both correctness metrics (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence metrics (format, length). Across all settings, GDPO consistently outperforms GRPO, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability for multi-reward reinforcement learning optimization."

We utilize resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to study the influence of $A$-site disorder on the $B$-site electronic structure of NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$. Ni L-edge RIXS measurements reveal a Ni$^{2+}$ electronic structure in nearly ideal octahedral coordination, with only a small trigonal compression ($δ$ = -200$\\;$meV) required to capture all spectral features. Within the $D_{3d}$ symmetry of the Ni local environment, we extract an anisotropic $g$-factor of $g_{\\parallel} = 2.26$ and $g_{\\perp} = 2.27$, and a corresponding paramagnetic moment of $μ_{\\rm{eff}}=3.2\\;μ_B$.

Several prior generative models are limited to generating partial neural network weights, particularly for larger models, such as ResNet and ViT. Those that do generate complete weights struggle with generation speed or require finetuning of the generated models. In this work, we present DeepWeightFlow, a Flow Matching model that operates directly in weight space to generate diverse and high-accuracy neural network weights for a variety of architectures, neural network sizes, and data modalities. The neural networks generated by DeepWeightFlow do not require fine-tuning to perform well and can scale to large networks. We apply Git Re-Basin and TransFusion for neural network canonicalization in the context of generative weight models to account for the impact of neural network permutation symmetries and to improve generation efficiency for larger model sizes. The generated networks excel at transfer learning, and ensembles of hundreds of neural networks can be generated in minutes, far exceeding the efficiency of diffusion-based methods. DeepWeightFlow models pave the way for more efficient and scalable generation of diverse sets of neural networks."

While the original formulation is based on a nonrelativistic approximation and is thus limited to a [1,1] approximant for self-consistency, we extend the framework by explicitly including the higher-order terms up to $\\mathcal{O}(k^6)$. We systematically investigate the reliability and robustness of the generalized ERE by incorporating relativistic kinematic effects. In addition, we develop a relativistic version of the ERE that accounts for lhc contributions. These results affirm the generalized ERE as a robust and systematically improvable framework for near-threshold scattering processes, providing both analytical and numerical reliability for applications in two-body scattering problems with a particle exchange."

    "abstract": "Applying weight decay (WD) to matrix layers is standard practice in large-language-model pretraining. Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces a Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices W, whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to a WD-noise equilibrium with a certain weight norm ||W||. In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon."

For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology."

However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments."

In this work, we aim to shed light on the impact of quantum processing within hybrid quantum-classical neural network architectures through a rigorous statistical study. We systematically assess common hybrid models on medical signal data as well as planar and volumetric images, examining the influence attributable to classical and quantum aspects such as encoding schemes, entanglement, and circuit size. We find that in best-case scenarios, hybrid models show performance comparable to their classical counterparts, however, in most cases, performance metrics deteriorate under the influence of quantum components. Our multi-modal analysis provides realistic insights into the contributions of quantum components and advocates for cautious claims and design choices for hybrid models in near-term applications."

Despite decades of research, provenance tracing remains challenging due to computational costs and storage overhead.

Temporal provenance is a promising direction, attaching timestamps to provenance information, enabling time-focused queries without maintaining complete historical records. However, existing temporal provenance methods primarily focus on system-level debugging, leaving a gap in data management applications. This paper proposes an agenda that uses Temporal Interaction Networks (TINs) to represent temporal provenance efficiently. We demonstrate TINs' applicability across streaming systems, transportation networks, and financial networks. We classify data into discrete and liquid types, define five temporal provenance query types, and propose a state-based indexing approach.

Complementing this, Qwen3-VL-Reranker performs fine-grained relevance estimation for query-document pairs using a cross-encoder architecture with cross-attention mechanisms. Both model series inherit the multilingual capabilities of Qwen3-VL, supporting more than 30 languages, and are released in $\\textbf{2B}$ and $\\textbf{8B}$ parameter sizes to accommodate diverse deployment requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3-VL-Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse multimodal embedding evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B attains an overall score of $\\textbf{77.8}$ on MMEB-V2, ranking first among all models (as of January 8, 2025). This report presents the architecture, training methodology, and practical capabilities of the series, demonstrating their effectiveness on various multimodal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and video-text matching."

However, existing detection methods remain fragmented, specializing either in facial-region forgeries or full-body synthetic images, and consequently fail to generalize across the full spectrum of human image manipulations. We introduce HuForDet, a holistic framework for human image forgery detection, which features a dual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a face forgery detection branch that employs heterogeneous experts operating in both RGB and frequency domains, including an adaptive Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) module designed to capture artifacts ranging from fine-grained blending boundaries to coarse-scale texture irregularities; and (2) a contextualized forgery detection branch that leverages a Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to analyze full-body semantic consistency, enhanced with a confidence estimation mechanism that dynamically weights its contribution during feature fusion. We curate a human image forgery (HuFor) dataset that unifies existing face forgery data with a new corpus of full-body synthetic humans. Extensive experiments show that our HuForDet achieves state-of-the-art forgery detection performance and superior robustness across diverse human image forgeries."

To address this problem, we propose SeqWalker, a navigation model built on a hierarchical planning framework. Our SeqWalker features: i) A High-Level Planner that dynamically selects global instructions into contextually relevant sub-instructions based on the agent's current visual observations, thus reducing cognitive load; ii) A Low-Level Planner incorporating an Exploration-Verification strategy that leverages the inherent logical structure of instructions for trajectory error correction. To evaluate SH-VLN performance, we also extend the IVLN dataset and establish a new benchmark. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SeqWalker."

It can be applied to programs taking string inputs, even when only a single failure-inducing input is available. DDMIN is an algorithm that systematically explores the minimal failure-inducing input that exposes a bug, given an initial failing input. However, it does not provide information about the faulty statements responsible for the failure. DDMIN-LOC addresses this limitation by collecting the passing and failing inputs generated during the DDMIN process and computing suspiciousness scores for program statements and predicates using SBFL algorithms. These scores are then combined to rank statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. DDMIN-LOC requires only one failing input of the buggy program, although it can be applied only to programs that take string inputs. DDMIN-LOC was evaluated on 136 programs selected from the QuixBugs and Codeflaws benchmarks using the SBFL algorithms Tarantula, Ochiai, GenProg, Jaccard and DStar. Experimental results show that DDMIN-LOC performs best with Jaccard: in most subjects, fewer than 20% executable lines need to be examined to locate the faulty statements. Moreover, in most subjects, faulty statements are ranked within the top 3 positions in all the generated test suites derived from different failing inputs."

However, existing trading systems struggle to jointly reason over noisy multi-source web evidence while maintaining robustness to rapid price shocks at sub-second timescales. The first challenge lies in synthesizing unstructured web content, social sentiment, and structured OHLCV signals into coherent and interpretable trading decisions without amplifying spurious correlations, while the second challenge concerns risk control, as slow deliberative reasoning pipelines are ill-suited for handling abrupt market shocks that require immediate defensive responses. To address these challenges, we propose WebCryptoAgent, an agentic trading framework that decomposes web-informed decision making into modality-specific agents and consolidates their outputs into a unified evidence document for confidence-calibrated reasoning. We further introduce a decoupled control architecture that separates strategic hourly reasoning from a real-time second-level risk model, enabling fast shock detection and protective intervention independent of the trading loop. Extensive experiments on real-world cryptocurrency markets demonstrate that WebCryptoAgent improves trading stability, reduces spurious activity, and enhances tail-risk handling compared to existing baselines.

    "abstract": "Short-time approximations and path integrals can be dominated by high-energy or large-field contributions, especially in the presence of singular interactions, motivating regulators that are suppressive yet removable. Standard regulators typically impose such suppressions by hand (e.g. cutoffs, higher-derivative terms, heat-kernel smearing, lattice discretizations), while here we show that closely related smooth filters can arise as the conditional map produced by interference in a coherently controlled, postselected superposition of evolutions. A successful postselection implements a single heralded operator that is a coherent linear combination of time-evolution operators. For a Gaussian superposition of time translations in quantum mechanics, the postselected step is $V_{σ,Δt}=e^{-iHΔt}\\,e^{-\\frac12σ^2Δt^2H^2}$, i.e.\\ the desired unitary step multiplied by a Gaussian energy filter suppressing energies above order $1/(σΔt)$. This renders short-time kernels in time-sliced path-integral approximations well behaved for singular potentials, while the target unitary dynamics is recovered as $σ\\to0$ and (for fixed $σ$) also as $Δt\\to0$ at fixed $t$. In scalar QFT, a local Gaussian smearing of the quartic coupling induces a positive $(σ^2/2)φ^8$ term in the Euclidean action, providing a symmetry-compatible large-field stabilizer; it is naturally viewed as an irrelevant operator whose effects can be renormalized at fixed $σ$ (together with a conventional UV regulator) and removed by taking $σ\\to0$. We give short-time error bounds and analyze multi-step success probabilities."

Specifically noted were reductions in variability moving into an event and level changes immediately after a event. Because global standing-wave data have a short history and no $90^{\\circ}$ events have occurred since that period, we examine here whether these geometric configuration events correspond to similar signatures in the long sunspot count record. Using daily sunspot data from January 1935 through December 2024, we conducted empirical studies assessing variance changes, post-event level shifts, and potential intrinsic oscillatory structure. In Study A, a variance-ratio test showed that sunspot variability was systematically lower during the events than in the preceding period, with 21 of 26 events since 1935 exhibiting reduced variance (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study B, solar activity level declined roughly 21 days after events ended, with 21 of 26 events showing negative changes (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study C, wavelet and filtering analyses revealed no internal solar oscillations at comparable timescales. These findings provide empirical evidence that the configuration events are associated with shifts in solar activity. The next three configuration events in mid- and late-2026 offer an opportunity to assess these patterns in real time."

We propose CRANE, a relevance-based analysis framework that redefines language specificity in terms of functional necessity, identifying language-specific neurons through targeted neuron-level interventions. CRANE characterizes neuron specialization by their contribution to language-conditioned predictions rather than activation magnitude. Our implementation will be made publicly available. Neuron-level interventions reveal a consistent asymmetric pattern: masking neurons relevant to a target language selectively degrades performance on that language while preserving performance on other languages to a substantial extent, indicating language-selective but non-exclusive neuron specializations. Experiments on English, Chinese, and Vietnamese across multiple benchmarks, together with a dedicated relevance-based metric and base-to-chat model transfer analysis, show that CRANE isolates language-specific components more precisely than activation-based methods."

    "abstract": "Clinical trials shape medical evidence and determine who gains access to experimental therapies. Whether participation in these trials reflects the global burden of disease remains unclear. Here we analyze participation inequality across more than 62,000 randomized controlled trials spanning 16 major disease categories from 2000 to 2024. Linking 36.8 million trial participants to country-level disease burden, we show that global inequality in clinical trial participation is overwhelmingly structured by country rather than disease. Country-level factors explain over 90% of variation in participation, whereas disease-specific effects contribute only marginally. Removing entire disease categories, including those traditionally considered underfunded, has little effect on overall inequality. Instead, participation is highly concentrated geographically, with a small group of countries enrolling a disproportionate share of participants across nearly all diseases. These patterns have persisted despite decades of disease-targeted funding and increasing alignment between research attention and disease burden within diseases. Our findings indicate that disease-vertical strategies alone cannot correct participation inequality. Reducing global inequities in clinical research requires horizontal investments in research capacity, health infrastructure, and governance that operate across disease domains."

To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR). The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and critiquing each other's logic while being guided by process-aware advantage that requires no external scoring model. This reward combines explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty to jointly optimize reasoning fidelity and verification rigor. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

As such, accurately identifying latent clusters of FSP is essential for effective air quality and public health management. This task, however, is notably nontrivial as FSP clusters may depend on various regional and temporal factors, which should be incorporated in the modeling process. Thus, we capitalize on Bayesian nonparametric dynamic clustering ideas, in which clustering structures may be influenced by complex dependencies. Existing implementations of dynamic clustering, however, rely on copula-based dependent Dirichlet processes (DPs), presenting considerable computational challenges for real-world deployment. With this in mind, we propose a more efficient alternative for dynamic clustering by incorporating the novel ideas of logistic-beta dependent DPs. We also adopt a Stirling-gamma prior, a novel distribution family, on the concentration parameter of our underlying DP, easing the process of incorporating prior knowledge into the model. Efficient computational strategies for posterior inference are also presented. We apply our proposed method to identify dynamic FSP clusters across Chile and demonstrate its superior performance over existing approaches."

While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development."

We define specificity relative to a contrast set, where a description is more specific to the extent that it picks out the target image better than other possible images. We construct a dataset that controls for length while varying information content, and validate that people reliably prefer more specific descriptions regardless of length. We find that controlling for length alone cannot account for differences in specificity: how the length budget is allocated makes a difference. These results support evaluation approaches that directly prioritize specificity over verbosity."

Such cases, in which the system is in uncertain conditions, can violate the system's safety and security requirements.

However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring knowledge chaining. In this work, we study the effect of editing knowledge with ROME on different layer depths and identify three key failure modes. First, the \"hopping-too-late\" problem occurs as later layers lack access to necessary intermediate representations. Second, generalization ability deteriorates sharply when editing later layers. Third, the model overfits to edited knowledge, incorrectly prioritizing edited-hop answers regardless of context. To mitigate the issues of \"hopping-too-late\" and generalisation decay, we propose Redundant Editing, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances multi-hop reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach can improve accuracy on 2-hop questions by at least 15.5 percentage points, representing a 96% increase over the previous single-edit strategy, while trading off some specificity and language naturalness."

With the rotation axis laterally offset relative to the acoustic focus, the spiral surface functions as a series of translating slopes. Experimental and numerical results confirm stable, bidirectional transport, yielding a vertical displacement of approximately $0.58λ$ per revolution and a maximum height of $3.18λ$, with radial confinement maintained within $0.24λ$.

This prior study was limited to a maximal field strength of 41.5 T, and mapped the $b-ac$ rotation plane. Here we measure a high quality sample with residual resistivity ratio RRR = 605 under rotations in the $b-c$ plane up to 45 T. This extended field range helps to unambiguously demonstrate the spillover of SC3 outside the polarized paramagnetic state. This is identified by the observation of zero resistance at low temperatures, for magnetic field strengths lower than the metamagnetic transition field resolved at higher temperatures. This observation is consistent with the scenario that electronic pairing of the SC3 phase is mediated by quantum critical fluctuations."

    "abstract": "Real-world design documents (e.g., posters) are inherently multi-layered, combining decoration, text, and images. Editing them from natural-language instructions requires fine-grained, layer-aware reasoning to identify relevant layers and coordinate modifications. Prior work largely overlooks multi-layer design document editing, focusing instead on single-layer image editing or multi-layer generation, which assume a flat canvas and lack the reasoning needed to determine what and where to modify. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Layer Document Editing Agent (MiLDEAgent), a reasoning-based framework that combines an RL-trained multimodal reasoner for layer-wise understanding with an image editor for targeted modifications. To systematically benchmark this setting, we introduce the MiLDEBench, a human-in-the-loop corpus of over 20K design documents paired with diverse editing instructions. The benchmark is complemented by a task-specific evaluation protocol, MiLDEEval, which spans four dimensions including instruction following, layout consistency, aesthetics, and text rendering. Extensive experiments on 14 open-source and 2 closed-source models reveal that existing approaches fail to generalize: open-source models often cannot complete multi-layer document editing tasks, while closed-source models suffer from format violations. In contrast, MiLDEAgent achieves strong layer-aware reasoning and precise editing, significantly outperforming all open-source baselines and attaining performance comparable to closed-source models, thereby establishing the first strong baseline for multi-layer document editing."

    "abstract": "Segmentation of the left atrial (LA) wall and endocardium from late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) MRI is essential for quantifying atrial fibrosis in patients with atrial fibrillation. The development of accurate machine learning-based segmentation models remains challenging due to the limited availability of data and the complexity of anatomical structures. In this work, we investigate 3D conditional generative models as potential solution for augmenting scarce LGE training data and improving LA segmentation performance. We develop a pipeline to synthesize high-fidelity 3D LGE MRI volumes from composite semantic label maps combining anatomical expert annotations with unsupervised tissue clusters, using three 3D conditional generators (Pix2Pix GAN, SPADE-GAN, and SPADE-LDM). The synthetic images are evaluated for realism and their impact on downstream LA segmentation. SPADE-LDM generates the most realistic and structurally accurate images, achieving an FID of 4.063 and surpassing GAN models, which have FIDs of 40.821 and 7.652 for Pix2Pix and SPADE-GAN, respectively. When augmented with synthetic LGE images, the Dice score for LA cavity segmentation with a 3D U-Net model improved from 0.908 to 0.936, showing a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) over the baseline.These findings demonstrate the potential of label-conditioned 3D synthesis to enhance the segmentation of under-represented cardiac structures."

While closed-source LLMs generate functional code, the resulting charts often lack semantic alignment and clarity, qualities that can only be assessed post-execution. Open-source models struggle even more, frequently producing non-executable or visually poor outputs. Although supervised fine-tuning can improve code executability, it fails to enhance overall visualization quality, as traditional SFT loss cannot capture post-execution feedback. To address this gap, we propose RL-Text2Vis, the first reinforcement learning framework for Text2Vis generation. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our method uses a novel multi-objective reward that jointly optimizes textual accuracy, code validity, and visualization quality using post-execution feedback. By training Qwen2.5 models (7B and 14B), RL-Text2Vis achieves a 22% relative improvement in chart quality over GPT-4o on the Text2Vis benchmark and boosts code execution success from 78% to 97% relative to its zero-shot baseline. Our models significantly outperform strong zero-shot and supervised baselines and also demonstrate robust generalization to out-of-domain datasets like VIS-Eval and NVBench. These results establish GRPO as an effective strategy for structured, multimodal reasoning in visualization generation. We release our code at https://github.com/vis-nlp/RL-Text2Vis."

Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%). The most powerful innovation recipes combine multiple patterns: Gap-Driven Reframing + Representation Shift, Cross-Domain Synthesis + Representation Shift, and Gap-Driven Reframing + Cross-Domain Synthesis.

    "abstract": "Imputing missing values in spatial-temporal traffic data is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance. To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy."

A sharp transition band is critical for precise spectral shaping and interference suppression, yet conventional MWP filters face challenges in achieving both sharp transitions and high reconfigurability. Adaptive MWP filters with sharp transition based on a transversal filter structure using an optical microcomb source are demonstrated in this paper. Four different types of single-band MWP filters with roll-off rates up to ~32.6 dB/GHz and a minimum shape factor of ~1.15 are achieved. In addition, simply through designing tap coefficients, band-pass filters with tunable centre frequencies ranging from 5 GHz to 15 GHz and dual-band MWP filters with various filter response are demonstrated without changing any hardware, where sharp transition is also validated. The adaptive filters with sharp transition presented in this paper offer a stable and highly reconfigurable solution for applications requiring stringent spectral selectivity, such as next-generation wireless networks, high-resolution radar imaging, and advanced biomedical photonic sensing."

    "abstract": "By their nature it is difficult to differentiate chaotic dynamical systems through measurement. In recent years, work has begun on using methods of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to qualitatively type dynamical data by approximating the topology of the underlying attracting set. This comes with the additional challenges of high dimensionality incurring computational complexity along with the lack of directional information encoded in the approximated topology. Due to the latter fact, standard methods of TDA for this high dimensional dynamical data do not differentiate between periodic cycles and non-periodic cycles in the attractor. We present a framework to address both of these challenges. We begin by binning the dynamical data, and capturing the sequential information in the form of a coarse-grained weighted and directed network. We then calculate the persistent Dowker homology of the asymmetric network, encoding spatial and temporal information. Analytically, we highlight the differences in periodic and non-periodic cycles by providing a full characterization of their one-dimensional Dowker persistences. We prove how the homologies of graph wedge sums can be described in terms of the wedge component homologies. Finally, we generalize our characterization to cactus graphs with arbitrary edge weights and orientations. Our analytical results give insight into how our method captures temporal information in its asymmetry, producing a persistence framework robust to noise and sensitive to dynamical structure."

    "abstract": "According to Gartner, more than 70% of organizations will have integrated AI models into their workflows by the end of 2025. In order to reduce cost and foster innovation, it is often the case that pre-trained models are fetched from model hubs like Hugging Face or TensorFlow Hub. However, this introduces a security risk where attackers can inject malicious code into the models they upload to these hubs, leading to various kinds of attacks including remote code execution (RCE), sensitive data exfiltration, and system file modification when these models are loaded or executed (predict function). Since AI models play a critical role in digital transformation, this would drastically increase the number of software supply chain attacks. While there are several efforts at detecting malware when deserializing pickle based saved models (hiding malware in model parameters), the risk of abusing DL APIs (e.g. TensorFlow APIs) is understudied. Specifically, we show how one can abuse hidden functionalities of TensorFlow APIs such as file read/write and network send/receive along with their persistence APIs to launch attacks. It is concerning to note that existing scanners in model hubs like Hugging Face and TensorFlow Hub are unable to detect some of the stealthy abuse of such APIs. This is because scanning tools only have a syntactically identified set of suspicious functionality that is being analysed. They often do not have a semantic-level understanding of the functionality utilized. After demonstrating the possible attacks, we show how one may identify potentially abusable hidden API functionalities using LLMs and build scanners to detect such abuses."

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have become a powerful paradigm for building high performance intelligent applications. Within these systems, the router responsible for determining which expert agents should handle a given query plays a crucial role in overall performance. Existing routing strategies generally fall into two categories: performance routing, which balances latency and cost across models of different sizes, and task routing, which assigns queries to domain-specific experts to improve accuracy. In real-world enterprise applications, task routing is more suitable; however, most existing approaches rely on static single-label decisions, which introduce two major limitations: (i) difficulty in seamlessly integrating new agents as business domains expand, and (ii) routing conflicts caused by overlapping agent capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.To address these challenges, we propose TCAndon-Router(TCAR): an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional routers, TCAR supports dynamic agent onboarding and first generates a natural-language reasoning chain before predicting a set of candidate agents capable of handling the query. In addition, we design a collaborative execution pipeline in which selected agents independently produce responses, which are then aggregated and refined into a single high-quality response by a dedicated Refining Agent.Experiments on public datasets and real enterprise data demonstrate that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy, reduces routing conflicts, and remains robust in ambiguous scenarios. We have released TCAR at https://huggingface.co/tencent/TCAndon-Router to support future research on explainable and collaborative multi-agent routing."

    "abstract": "In recurrent neural networks (RNNs) used to model biological neural networks, noise is typically introduced during training to emulate biological variability and regularize learning. The expectation is that removing the noise at test time should preserve or improve performance. Contrary to this intuition, we find that continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) often perform best at a nonzero noise level, specifically, the same level used during training. This noise preference typically arises when noise is injected inside the neural activation function; networks trained with noise injected outside the activation function perform best with zero noise. Through analyses of simple function approximation, maze navigation, and single neuron regulator tasks, we show that the phenomenon stems from noise-induced shifts of fixed points (stationary distributions) in the underlying stochastic dynamics of the RNNs. These fixed point shifts are noise-level dependent and bias the network outputs when the noise is removed, degrading performance. Analytical and numerical results show that the bias arises when neural states operate near activation function nonlinearities, where noise is asymmetrically attenuated, and that performance optimization incentivizes operation near these nonlinearities. Thus, networks can overfit to the stochastic training environment itself rather than just to the input-output data. The phenomenon is distinct from stochastic resonance, wherein nonzero noise enhances signal processing. Our findings reveal that training noise can become an integral part of the computation learned by recurrent networks, with implications for understanding neural population dynamics and for the design of robust artificial RNNs."

From the 143 known PNe of M~33, the photometry of only 13 are present in the J-PLUS catalog, as available on the J-PLUS portal. With the aim of recovering a larger fraction of the M~33 PN population, the software SExtractor is adopted to extract the sources in the J-PLUS images and obtain the photometric data for the PNe known in the literature, performing PSF photometry when possible. With this procedure the photometry of 98 PNe was obtained using H$α$ image as detection image, including the 13 already present in the J-PLUS catalog. Using diagnostic color-color diagrams (DCCDs) based on criteria developed for Milky Way halo PNe, we identified 16 sources with PN-like colors. Cross-match with existing catalogs revealed that most of these candidates are H II regions, though one source remains unidentified. Additionally, analyzing their full width at half maximum, most of them would not be PN candidates. This highlights the method's ability to select emission-line objects but also underscores the challenge of distinguishing PNe from contaminants using photometry alone. The J-PLUS colors of 98 known PNe were analyzed, together with literature information on their radial velocities, resulting in the identification of one possible halo PN. This is the first paper which aims at detecting extragalactic PNe in multi-band surveys such as J-PLUS, the Southern Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) and the Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS), paving the way for similar studies in these surveys for other nearby galaxies, which lack catalogs of known PNe."

The model incorporates surface stretching, curvature, and surface gradients of stretching into the surface energy, thereby capturing small-length-scale effects absent from earlier surface elasticity formulations. The theory, supplemented with physically motivated tip conditions, is applied to the mixed mode-I/mode-II loading of a finite straight crack in an infinite isotropic plate. Using complex-analytic techniques, it is shown that the resulting stress and strain fields remain bounded up to the crack tips for nearly all admissible parameter values. Combined with previous results for mode-III loading, the analysis demonstrates that linearized surface-substrate models incorporating surface strain-gradient elasticity eliminate crack-tip singularities across all principal modes of far-field loading."

Standard functional data analysis (FDA) methods, which prioritize smoothness, often fail to capture these dynamic structural features, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This article introduces Adaptive Joint Learning (AJL), a regularization framework designed to simultaneously perform functional variable selection and structural changepoint detection in multivariate time-varying coefficient models. We propose a convex optimization procedure that synergizes adaptive group-wise penalization with fused regularization, effectively borrowing strength across multiple outcomes to enhance estimation efficiency. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the estimator in the ultra-high-dimensional regime (p >> n), establishing non-asymptotic error bounds and proving that AJL achieves the oracle property--performing as well as if the true active set and changepoint locations were known a priori. A key theoretical contribution is the explicit handling of approximation bias via undersmoothing conditions to ensure valid asymptotic inference. The proposed method is validated through comprehensive simulations and an application to Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) data. The analysis uncovers synchronized phase transitions in disease progression and identifies a parsimonious set of time-varying prognostic markers."

After extracting and normalizing the photometric time series, the light curve was phase-folded using an initial ephemeris and modeled with a physical transit model to determine the system's geometric parameters. From the transit modeling, we measure the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital inclination, impact parameter, and transit duration. Adopting stellar parameters from the literature, we derive the planetary radius and transit depth, confirming the highly inflated nature of WASP-12 b. Individual mid-transit times were measured and used to refine the orbital ephemeris through a weighted linear fit. The resulting refined orbital period and reference epoch improve the predictive accuracy of future transit times over the TESS observational baseline. An observed-minus-calculated (O-C) analysis reveals no statistically significant transit timing variations, indicating that the timing data are consistent with a linear ephemeris within the measurement uncertainties.

    "abstract": "Fractional Burgers equations pose substantial challenges for classical numerical methods due to the combined effects of nonlocality and shock-forming nonlinear dynamics. In particular, linear approximation frameworks-such as spectral, finite-difference, or discontinuous Galerkin methods-often suffer from Gibbs-type oscillations or require carefully tuned stabilization mechanisms, whose effectiveness degrades in transport-dominated and long-time integration regimes. In this work, we introduce a sequential-in-time nonlinear parametrization (STNP) for solving fractional Burgers equations, including models with a fractional Laplacian or with nonlocal nonlinear fluxes. The solution is represented by a nonlinear parametric ansatz, and the parameter evolution is obtained by projecting the governing dynamics onto the tangent space of the parameter manifold through a regularized least-squares formulation at each time step. This yields a well-posed and stable time-marching scheme that preserves causality and avoids global-in-time optimization. We provide a theoretical analysis of the resulting projected dynamics, including a stability estimate and an a posteriori error bound that explicitly decomposes the total error into contributions from initial condition fitting, projection residuals, and discretization of fractional operators. Our analysis clarifies the stabilizing role of regularization and quantifies its interaction with the nonlocal discretization error. Numerical experiments for both fractional Burgers models demonstrate that STNP achieves oscillation-free shock resolution and accurately captures long-time dynamics. The method consistently outperforms high-order spectral schemes augmented with spectral vanishing viscosity, while requiring significantly fewer degrees of freedom and avoiding ad hoc stabilization."

To overcome this limitation, here we introduce the concept of temporal illusion: A temporally dynamic framework in which carefully programmed temporal variations in effective parameters generate responses akin to those of, in principle, any arbitrary time-invariant structure. We theoretically demonstrate that proper modulation of the permittivity of a conventional dielectric in space and time replicates the optical behavior associated with exotic materials. Besides, we reveal that, beyond steady-state effects, temporal illusion also enables control over transient responses, for instance, by effectively lowering the time constant of high-quality-factor resonators, therefore, allowing faster energy accumulation. Moreover, by incorporating detuning between modulation and excitation, we show that the framework unlocks additional functionalities. The temporal illusion paradigm thus broadens the capabilities of space-time varying systems, offering a powerful route to synthesize material responses on demand and paving the way for new theoretical and experimental directions in optics and wave physics."

Especially with upcoming gamma-ray detectors that can directly detect radioactive isotopes out to increasing distances from gamma-rays emitted during their decay, nuclear yields have the potential to provide some of the most direct probes of supernova engines and stellar burning. To utilize these probes, we must understand and limit the uncertainties in their production. Uncertainties in the nuclear physics can be minimized by combining both laboratory experiments and nuclear theory. Similarly, astrophysical uncertainties caused by simplified explosion trajectories can be minimized by higher-fidelity stellar-evolution and supernova-engine models. This paper reviews the physics and astrophysics uncertainties in modeling nucleosynthetic yields, identifying the key areas of study needed to maximize the potential of supernova yields as probes of astrophysical transients and dense-matter physics."

    "abstract": "Memory management is vital for LLM agents to handle long-term interaction and personalization. Most research focuses on how to organize and use memory summary, but often overlooks the initial memory extraction stage. In this paper, we argue that existing summary-based methods have two major limitations based on the recurrent processing theory. First, summarization is \"ahead-of-time\", acting as a blind \"feed-forward\" process that misses important details because it doesn't know future tasks. Second, extraction is usually \"one-off\", lacking a feedback loop to verify facts, which leads to the accumulation of information loss. To address these issues, we propose proactive memory extraction (namely ProMem). Unlike static summarization, ProMem treats extraction as an iterative cognitive process. We introduce a recurrent feedback loop where the agent uses self-questioning to actively probe the dialogue history. This mechanism allows the agent to recover missing information and correct errors. Our ProMem significantly improves the completeness of the extracted memory and QA accuracy. It also achieves a superior trade-off between extraction quality and token cost."

We introduce HATCC (Holonomy-Aware Tree Compilation), an algorithm that detects descent obstructions via holonomy computation on the factor nerve, compiles non-trivial holonomy into mode variables, and reduces to tree BP on an augmented graph.

    "abstract": "As superconducting quantum processors continue to scale, high-performance quantum control becomes increasingly critical. In densely integrated architectures, unwanted interactions between nearby qubits give rise to crosstalk errors that limit operational performance. In particular, direct exchange-type (XY) interactions are typically minimized by designing large frequency detunings between neighboring qubits at the hardware level. However, frequency crowding in large-scale systems ultimately restricts the achievable frequency separation. While such XY coupling facilitates entangling gate operations, its residual presence poses a key challenge during single-qubit controls. Here, we propose a scalable pulse-level control framework, incorporating frequency modulation (FM) and dynamical decoupling (DD), to suppress XY crosstalk errors. This framework operates independently of coupling strengths, reducing calibration overhead and naturally supporting multi-qubit connectivity. Numerical simulations show orders-of-magnitude reductions in infidelity for both idle and single-qubit gates in a two-qubit system. We further validate scalability in a five-qubit layout, where crosstalk between a central qubit and four neighbors is simultaneously suppressed. Our crosstalk suppression framework provides a practical route toward high-fidelity operation in dense superconducting architectures."

In this work, we extend VarPro to solve minimization problems containing a differentiable regularization term on the nonlinear parameters, along with a general-form Tikhonov regularization term on the linear variables. Furthermore, we develop a quasi-Newton method for solving the resulting reduced problem, and provide a local convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions, establishing conditions for superlinear or quadratic convergence. For large-scale settings, we introduce an inexact LSQR-based variant and prove its local convergence despite inner-solve and Hessian approximations. Numerical experiments on semi-blind deblurring show that parameter regularization prevents degenerate no-blur solutions and that the proposed methods achieve accurate reconstructions, with the inexact variant offering a favorable accuracy-cost tradeoff consistent with the theory."

Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory. We also apply the results to identify the perturbed locations of special curves in the parameter space: circular orbits and the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits."

In simple systems such as $\\textit{Hydra}$, growing evidence suggests that mechanical forces generated by collective cellular activity play a central role in this process. Here, we explore a physical mechanism for axis formation based on the coupling between active stresses and tissue elasticity. We analyse the elastic deformation induced by activity-generated stresses and show that, owing to the spherical topology of the tissue, forces globally condense toward configurations in which both elastic strain and nematic defect localise at opposite poles. These mechanically selected states define either a polar or apolar head-food axis. To characterize the condensed regime, we introduce a compact parametrization of of the active force and flux distributions, enabling analytical predictions and direct comparison with experiments. Using this framework, we calculate experimentally relevant observables, including areal strain, lateral pressure, and normal displacements during muscular contraction, as well as the detailed structure of topological defect complexes in head and foot regions. Together, our results identify a mechanical route by which active tissues can spontaneously break symmetry at the organismal scale, suggesting a general physical principle underlying body-axis specification during morphogenesis."

    "abstract": "Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $ρ_{\\rm vac}=ρ_{\\rm vac}(H, \\dot{H},\\ddot{H},\\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $Λ$). In the FLRW epoch, $ρ_{\\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $Λ\\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $δρ_{\\rm vac}\\sim {\\cal O}(m_{\\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions."

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the value function of Bolza problems governed by stochastic difference equations, with particular emphasis on the convex non-anticipative case. Our goal is to provide some insights on the structure of the subdiferential of the value function. In particular, we establish a connection between the evolution of the subgradients of the value function and a stochastic difference equation of Hamiltonian type. This result can be seen as a transposition of the method of characteristics, introduced by Rockafellar and Wolenski in the 2000s, to the stochastic discrete-time setting. Similarly as done in the literature for the deterministic case, the analysis is based on a duality approach. For this reason we study first a dual representation for the value function in terms of the value function of a dual problem, which is a pseudo Bolza problem. The main difference with the deterministic case is that (due to the non-anticipativity) the symmetry between the Bolza problem and its dual is no longer valid. This in turn implies that ensuring the existence of minimizers for the Bolza problem (which is a key point for establishing the method of characteristics) is not as simple as in the deterministic case, and it should be addressed differently. To complete the exposition, we study the existence of minimizers for a particular class of Bolza problems governed by linear stochastic difference equations, the so-called linear-convex optimal control problems."

Forecasting Accurately predicting stock prices has always been a focal point for various researchers. However, existing statistical approaches for time-series prediction often fail to effectively forecast the probability range of future stock prices. Hence, to solve this problem, the Neural Prophet with a Deep Neural Network (NP-DNN) is proposed to predict stock market prices. The preprocessing technique used in this research is Z-score normalization, which normalizes stock price data by removing scale differences, making patterns easier to detect. Missing value imputation fills gaps in historical data, enhancing the models use of complete information for more accurate predictions. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) learns complex nonlinear relationships among stock market prices and extracts hidden patterns from the input data, thereby creating meaningful feature representations for better prediction accuracy. The proposed NP-DNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.21% compared with other approaches using the Fused Large Language Model.

However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}onsuming \\textbf{P}erformative \\textbf{L}oop (\\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored. Through experiments on three real-world tasks, we find that the performative loop increases preference bias and decreases disparate bias. We design a reward-based rejection sampling strategy to mitigate the bias, moving towards more trustworthy self-improving systems."

FUKA leverages the KADATH spectral library to solve the Einstein equations under the assumption of an isentropic fluid without magnetic fields while incorporating GRHayLEOS to support 3D tabulated equations of state in \\textit{stellar collapse} format. The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study. The new FUKA codes and results presented here lay the foundation for future extensions to more general configurations, including magnetic fields, removal of isentropic assumptions, and binary systems, and have been made publicly available to support community efforts in modeling differentially rotating relativistic stars."

In the low-$\\mathrm{Re}$ regime ($\\mathrm{Re} \\ll 1$), the flow dynamics are commonly approximated by the linear Stokes equation. Here we show that, within the framework of spatially fluctuating hydrodynamics, this linearization breaks down when the thermal noise is spatially correlated, even if $\\mathrm{Re} \\ll 1$. We perform direct numerical simulations of spatially correlated fluctuating hydrodynamics in both one and two dimensions. In one dimension, the linearized dynamics exhibit significantly slower relaxation of high-wavenumber Fourier modes than the full nonlinear dynamics. In two dimensions, an analogous discrepancy arises in the particle velocity autocorrelation function, which decays more slowly in the correlated linear Stokes case than in the correlated nonlinear Navier--Stokes case. In both settings, spatial correlations inhibit viscous momentum diffusion at small scales, leading to prolonged relaxation under the linear dynamics, whereas nonlinear mode coupling accelerates small-scale relaxation. Thus, the interplay between nonlinear coupling and viscous damping becomes scale dependent, invalidating the use of a single global Reynolds number. Taken together, these findings show that, for spatially correlated fluctuating fluids, the effective Reynolds number must be reinterpreted as a scale-dependent quantity."

We introduce Vision-Language Introspection (VLI), a training-free inference framework that simulates a metacognitive self-correction process. VLI first performs Attributive Introspection to diagnose hallucination risks via probabilistic conflict detection and localize the causal visual anchors. It then employs Interpretable Bi-Causal Steering to actively modulate the inference process, dynamically isolating visual evidence from background noise while neutralizing blind confidence through adaptive calibration.

Unlike all previous methods, our techniques apply to heavy-tailed distributions and include examples that do not even have finite covariances. Our method succeeds whenever the cluster distributions have a characteristic function with sufficiently heavy tails. Such distributions include the Laplace distribution but crucially exclude Gaussians. All previous methods for learning mixture models relied implicitly or explicitly on the low-degree moments. Even for the case of Laplace distributions, we prove that any such algorithm must use super-polynomially many samples. Our method thus adds to the short list of techniques that bypass the limitations of the method of moments. Somewhat surprisingly, our algorithm does not require any minimum separation between the cluster means. This is in stark contrast to spherical Gaussian mixtures where a minimum $\\ell_2$-separation is provably necessary even information-theoretically [Regev and Vijayaraghavan '17]. Our methods compose well with existing techniques and allow obtaining ''best of both worlds\" guarantees for mixtures where every component either has a heavy-tailed characteristic function or has a sub-Gaussian tail with a light-tailed characteristic function. Our algorithm is based on a new approach to learning mixture models via efficient high-dimensional sparse Fourier transforms. We believe that this method will find more applications to statistical estimation. As an example, we give an algorithm for consistent robust mean estimation against noise-oblivious adversaries, a model practically motivated by the literature on multiple hypothesis testing. It was formally proposed in a recent Master's thesis by one of the authors, and has already inspired follow-up works."

    "abstract": "Unlabeled LiDAR logs, in autonomous driving applications, are inherently a gold mine of dense 3D geometry hiding in plain sight - yet they are almost useless without human labels, highlighting a dominant cost barrier for autonomous-perception research. In this work we tackle this bottleneck by leveraging temporal-geometric consistency across LiDAR sweeps to lift and fuse cues from text and 2D vision foundation models directly into 3D, without any manual input. We introduce an unsupervised multi-modal pseudo-labeling method relying on strong geometric priors learned from temporally accumulated LiDAR maps, alongside with a novel iterative update rule that enforces joint geometric-semantic consistency, and vice-versa detecting moving objects from inconsistencies. Our method simultaneously produces 3D semantic labels, 3D bounding boxes, and dense LiDAR scans, demonstrating robust generalization across three datasets. We experimentally validate that our method compares favorably to existing semantic segmentation and object detection pseudo-labeling methods, which often require additional manual supervision. We confirm that even a small fraction of our geometrically consistent, densified LiDAR improves depth prediction by 51.5% and 22.0% MAE in the 80-150 and 150-250 meters range, respectively."

    "abstract": "This research examines how the emotional tone of human-AI interactions shapes ChatGPT and human behavior. In a between-subject experiment, we asked participants to express a specific emotion while working with ChatGPT (GPT-4.0) on two tasks, including writing a public response and addressing an ethical dilemma. We found that compared to interactions where participants maintained a neutral tone, ChatGPT showed greater improvement in its answers when participants praised ChatGPT for its responses. Expressing anger towards ChatGPT also led to a higher albeit smaller improvement relative to the neutral condition, whereas blaming ChatGPT did not improve its answers. When addressing an ethical dilemma, ChatGPT prioritized corporate interests less when participants expressed anger towards it, while blaming increases its emphasis on protecting the public interest. Additionally, we found that people used more negative, hostile, and disappointing expressions in human-human communication after interactions during which participants blamed rather than praised for their responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that the emotional tone people apply in human-AI interactions not only shape ChatGPT's outputs but also carry over into subsequent human-human communication."

However, existing citation classification frameworks often conflate citation intent (why a work is cited) with cited content type (what part is cited), limiting their effectiveness in auto classification due to a dilemma between fine-grained type distinctions and practical classification reliability. We introduce SOFT, a Semantically Orthogonal Framework with Two dimensions that explicitly separates citation intent from cited content type, drawing inspiration from semantic role theory. We systematically re-annotate the ACL-ARC dataset using SOFT and release a cross-disciplinary test set sampled from ACT2. Evaluation with both zero-shot and fine-tuned Large Language Models demonstrates that SOFT enables higher agreement between human annotators and LLMs, and supports stronger classification performance and robust cross-domain generalization compared to ACL-ARC and SciCite annotation frameworks. These results confirm SOFT's value as a clear, reusable annotation standard, improving clarity, consistency, and generalizability for digital libraries and scholarly communication infrastructures.

    "abstract": "Despite advances in upper-limb (UL) prosthetic design, achieving intuitive control of intermediate joints - such as the wrist and elbow - remains challenging, particularly for continuous and velocity-modulated movements. We introduce a novel movement-based control paradigm entitled Compensation Effect Amplification Control (CEAC) that leverages users' trunk flexion and extension as input for controlling prosthetic elbow velocity. Considering that the trunk can be both a functional and compensatory joint when performing upper-limb actions, CEAC amplifies the natural coupling between trunk and prosthesis while introducing a controlled delay that allows users to modulate both the position and velocity of the prosthetic joint. We evaluated CEAC in a generic drawing task performed by twelve able-bodied participants using a supernumerary prosthesis with an active elbow. Additionally a multiple-target-reaching task was performed by a subset of ten participants. Results demonstrate task performances comparable to those obtained with natural arm movements, even when gesture velocity or drawing size were varied, while maintaining ergonomic trunk postures. Analysis revealed that CEAC effectively restores joint coordinated action, distributes movement effort between trunk and elbow, enabling intuitive trajectory control without requiring extreme compensatory movements. Overall, CEAC offers a promising control strategy for intermediate joints of UL prostheses, particularly in tasks requiring continuous and precise coordination."

Traditional manual annotation of heterogeneous data modalities (text, images, video, audio, and web links), is prone to inconsistencies, quality degradation, and inefficiencies in content utilization. The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars). Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reproducible Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, ensuring smooth transitions and audio/visual alignment; (ii) a personalization mechanism based on role definition and prompt injection for tailored outputs (marketing, training, regulatory); (iii) a cost efficient e2e pipeline strategy balancing ALM/VLM enhanced processing. Evaluations on Video MME benchmark (900) and our proprietary dataset of 16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas demonstrate 3 to 4 times speedup, 4 times cost reduction, and competitive clip quality. Beyond efficiency gains, we also report our methods improved clip coherence scores (0.348) and informativeness scores (0.721) over state of the art VLM baselines (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), highlighting the potential of transparent, custom extractive, and compliance supporting video summarization for life sciences."

Using PolyFit, the surfaces can be efficiently deformed by updating a compact set of jet coefficients rather than optimizing per-vertex degrees of freedom for many downstream tasks in computer vision and graphics. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed methodologies with two applications: 1) Shape-from-template (SfT): where the goal is to deform the input 3D template of an object as seen in image/video. Using PolyFit, we adopt test-time optimization that delivers competitive accuracy while being markedly faster than offline physics-based solvers, and outperforms recent physics-guided neural simulators in accuracy at modest additional runtime. 2) Garment draping. We train a self-supervised, mesh- and garment-agnostic model that generalizes across resolutions and garment types, delivering up to an order-of-magnitude faster inference than strong baselines."

Our observations reveal distinctive low-energy spin excitations arising from gamma, gamma', and M' points, each featuring a spin gap of around 2.5 meV. The overall spin excitation spectra can be effectively described by a spin Hamiltonian incorporating substantial nearest-neighbor Kitaev and biquadratic interactions, along with Heisenberg interactions. Our findings not only establish VBr3 as a new Kitaev magnet but also suggest that ligand engineering may provide a promising strategy to modulate Kitaev interactions, offering new opportunities for designing Kitaev materials with tailored quantum properties."

This tunability originates from the coupling between the particle-induced rotational Poynting vector and the nonreciprocal surface plasmon polaritons supported by the plate. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive regime in which both energy and angular momentum transfer are maximized when the Weyl node separations are antiparallel rather than parallel. This arises from optimal mode matching between the rotation direction of the particle's circular heat flux and the propagation direction of the surface plasmon polaritons in the antiparallel configuration."

    "abstract": "The high directionality of wave propagation at millimeter-wave (mmWave) carrier frequencies results in only a small number of significant transmission paths between user equipments and the basestation (BS). This sparse nature of wave propagation is revealed in the beamspace domain, which is traditionally obtained by taking the spatial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) across a uniform linear antenna array at the BS, where each DFT output is associated with a distinct beam. In recent years, beamspace processing has emerged as a promising technique to reduce baseband complexity and power consumption in all-digital massive multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating at mmWave frequencies. However, it remains unclear whether the DFT is the optimal sparsifying transform for finite-dimensional antenna arrays. In this paper, we extend the framework of Zhai et al. for complete dictionary learning via $\\ell^4$-norm maximization to the complex case in order to learn new sparsifying transforms. We provide a theoretical foundation for $\\ell^4$-norm maximization and propose two suitable learning algorithms. We then utilize these algorithms (i) to assess the optimality of the DFT for sparsifying channel vectors theoretically and via simulations and (ii) to learn improved sparsifying transforms for real-world and synthetically generated channel vectors."

We present a machine learning approach based on support vector regression (SVR) that directly estimates the coherence measures and the geometric measure of quantum entanglement using minimal experimental resources. Our method requires only the diagonal entries of the density matrix, along with the traces of the squared and cubed density matrices for quantum coherence, and additionally along with the traces of the squared and cubed reduced density matrix for estimating quantum entanglement. These quantities can be obtained through random measurements or a hybrid quantum-classical framework. This approach significantly reduces the resource overhead compared to quantum state tomography while maintaining high accuracy. {Furthermore, the support vector quantile regression (SVQR) with pinball loss is employed to prevent SVR overestimation. This model not only ensures that over 95\\% of predictions are conservative lower bounds in most cases, but also maintains this lower-bound reliability for over 93\\% of predictions, despite 2\\% perturbations in the input features.} The proposed technique provides a practical and scalable tool for characterizing quantum resources across computation, communication, and metrology applications."

    "abstract": "Drug overdose deaths, including from opioids, remain a significant public health threat to the United States (US). To abate the harms of opioid misuse, understanding its prevalence at the local level is crucial for stakeholders in communities to develop response strategies that effectively use limited resources. Although there exist several state-specific studies that provide county-level prevalence estimates, such estimates are not widely available across the country, as the datasets used in these studies are not always readily available in other states, which, therefore, has limited the wider applications of existing models. To fill this gap, we propose a Bayesian multi-state data integration approach that fully utilizes publicly available data sources to estimate county-level opioid misuse prevalence for all counties in the US. The hierarchical structure jointly models opioid misuse prevalence and overdose death outcomes, leverages existing county-level prevalence estimates in limited states and state-level estimates from national surveys, and accounts for heterogeneity across counties and states with counties' covariates and mixed effects. Furthermore, our parsimonious and generalizable modeling framework employs horseshoe+ prior to flexibly shrink coefficients and prevent overfitting, ensuring adaptability as new county-level prevalence data in additional states become available. Using real-world data, our model shows high estimation accuracy through cross-validation and provides nationwide county-level estimates of opioid misuse for the first time."

Recent JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of overmassive black holes at z>4-6, where the BH masses lie far above local scaling relations and not reproduced by current cosmological models. How such overmassive black holes form and rapidly grow within young galaxies has remained unclear. Here we present fully cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that, for the first time, self-consistently follow the birth, early growth, and emergent observable signatures of SMBHs in proto-cluster environments. We find that heavy seeds of order $10^6 M_\\text{sun}$ naturally form, exceeding typical theoretical expectations by an order of magnitude. These seeds rapidly develop dense, optically thick disks whose strong electron scattering produces broad H$α$ emission comparable to that seen in little red dots (LRDs). Sustained super-Eddington accretion then drives fast growth to $\\sim 3 \\times 10^7 ~M_\\text{sun}$ by $z \\sim 8$. These results provide a unified physical scenario in which LRDs correspond to a short-lived, enshrouded phase of heavy-seed formation, naturally evolving into the overmassive quasars detected by JWST and ultimately the progenitors of today's SMBHs."

In realistic environments, rapid and free-running reference-frame variations can severely degrade both the key rate and transmission distance of conventional RFI-MDI-QKD. Here we propose a free-running RFI-MDI-QKD protocol that maintains high-rate key generation under rapid reference-frame variations. By introducing a classification-distillation method that reclassifies total detection events, secure keys can be extracted without modifying the experimental setup. Our protocol achieves a key rate more than nine times higher than the best previous RFI-MDI-QKD scheme and tolerates channel losses exceeding 24 dB, where earlier approaches fail.

Roller skating, as a sport with substantial biomechanical value, can achieve fast and continuous sliding through rational utilization of body inertia, featuring minimal kinetic energy loss. Therefore, this study proposes a novel humanoid robot with each foot equipped with a row of four passive wheels for roller skating. A deep reinforcement learning control framework is also developed for the swizzle gait with the reward function design based on the intrinsic characteristics of roller skating. The learned policy is first analyzed in simulation and then deployed on the physical robot to demonstrate the smoothness and efficiency of the swizzle gait over traditional bipedal walking gait in terms of Impact Intensity and Cost of Transport during locomotion. A reduction of $75.86\\%$ and $63.34\\%$ of these two metrics indicate roller skating as a superior locomotion mode for enhanced energy efficiency and joint longevity."

The SCN is divided into two subgroups of oscillating cells: the ventro-lateral (VL) neurons, which are exposed to light (photic signal) and the dorso-medial (DM) neurons which are coupled to the VL cells. When the coupling between these neurons is strong enough, the system synchronizes with the photic period. Upon increasing the cell coupling, the entrainment of the DM cells has been recently shown to occur via a very sharp (jumping) transition when the period of the photic input is larger than the intrinsic period of the cells. Here, we characterize this transition with a simple realistic model. We show that two bifurcations possibly lead to the disappearance of the endogenous mode. Using a mean field model, we show that the jumping transition results from a supercritical Hopf-like bifurcation. This finding implies that both the period and strength of the stimulating photic signal, and the relative fraction of cells in the VL and DM compartments are crucial in determining the synchronization of the system."

Despite this potential, much of the recent literature has relied on sparse, high-fidelity data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) rather than experimental sources like particle image velocimetry (PIV), which are not suitable for validating all reconstructed quantities. In the case of PIV, for example, pressure is not directly measured and the data have imperfections such as noise contamination or a limited field of view. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel methodology where PINNs are first trained on a RANS simulation such that it learns all states at every location in the domain. We then apply transfer learning which updates the PINN using sub-sampled PIV data. The resulting predictions are in significantly better agreement with the full PIV dataset than PINNs which are trained on experimental data only. This work builds on the recent literature by integrating a Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model and applying hard constraints to the no-slip wall boundary condition. We apply this new methodology to a two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil inclined at an angle of attack, $α$ = 15 degrees, for two Reynolds numbers of Re = 10,000 and 75,000. The proposed methodology is initially validated using large eddy simulation (LES) data and then demonstrated on experimental PIV data. Our transfer learning approach results in improved predictions and a reduction in training time when compared to using a random network initialisation."

    "abstract": "Humans can finely perceive material textures, yet articulating such somatic impressions in words is a cognitive bottleneck in design ideation. We present OnomaCompass, a web-based exploration system that links sound-symbolic onomatopoeia and visual texture representations to support early-stage material discovery. Instead of requiring users to craft precise prompts for generative AI, OnomaCompass provides two coordinated latent-space maps--one for texture images and one for onomatopoeic term--built from an authored dataset of invented onomatopoeia and corresponding textures generated via Stable Diffusion. Users can navigate both spaces, trigger cross-modal highlighting, curate findings in a gallery, and preview textures applied to objects via an image-editing model. The system also supports video interpolation between selected textures and re-embedding of extracted frames to form an emergent exploration loop. We conducted a within-subjects study with 11 participants comparing OnomaCompass to a prompt-based image-generation workflow using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (\"Nano Banana\"). OnomaCompass significantly reduced workload (NASA-TLX overall, mental demand, effort, and frustration; p < .05) and increased hedonic user experience (UEQ), while usability (SUS) favored the baseline. Qualitative findings indicate that OnomaCompass helps users externalize vague sensory expectations and promotes serendipitous discovery, but also reveals interaction challenges in spatial navigation. Overall, leveraging sound symbolism as a lightweight cue offers a complementary approach to Kansei-driven material ideation beyond prompt-centric generation."

    "abstract": "We investigate distributed online convex optimization with compressed communication, where $n$ learners connected by a network collaboratively minimize a sequence of global loss functions using only local information and compressed data from neighbors. Prior work has established regret bounds of $O(\\max\\{ω^{-2}ρ^{-4}n^{1/2},ω^{-4}ρ^{-8}\\}n\\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\\max\\{ω^{-2}ρ^{-4}n^{1/2},ω^{-4}ρ^{-8}\\}n\\ln{T})$ for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively, where $ω\\in(0,1]$ is the compression quality factor ($ω=1$ means no compression) and $ρ<1$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. However, these regret bounds suffer from a \\emph{quadratic} or even \\emph{quartic} dependence on $ω^{-1}$. Moreover, the \\emph{super-linear} dependence on $n$ is also undesirable. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves improved regret bounds of $\\tilde{O}(ω^{-1/2}ρ^{-1}n\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\tilde{O}(ω^{-1}ρ^{-2}n\\ln{T})$ for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively. The primary idea is to design a \\emph{two-level blocking update framework} incorporating two novel ingredients: an online gossip strategy and an error compensation scheme, which collaborate to \\emph{achieve a better consensus} among learners. Furthermore, we establish the first lower bounds for this problem, justifying the optimality of our results with respect to both $ω$ and $T$. Additionally, we consider the bandit feedback scenario, and extend our method with the classic gradient estimators to enhance existing regret bounds."

The estimator is defined as the least concave majorant on the positive half-line of the deconvolution estimator of the distribution function. We show its uniform consistency and its square root convergence in law in $\\ell_\\infty(\\mathbb R)$. To assess the validity of the concavity assumption, we construct a test for the nonparametric null hypothesis that the distribution function is concave on the positive half-line, against the alternative that it is not. We calibrate the test using bootstrap methods. The theoretical justification for calibration led us to establish a bootstrap version of Theorem 1 in Söhl and Trabs (2012), a Donsker-type result from which we obtain, as a special case, the limiting behavior of the deconvolution estimator of the distribution function in a bootstrap setting with measurement error. Combining this Donsker-type theorem with the functional delta method, we show that the test statistic and its bootstrap version have the same limiting distribution under the null hypothesis, whereas under the alternative, the bootstrap statistic is stochastically smaller. Consequently, the power of the test tends to one, for any fixed alternative, as the sample size tends to infinity. In addition to the theoretical results for the estimator and the test, we investigate their finite-sample performance in simulation studies."

    "abstract": "Driven by Moore's Law, the dimensions of transistors have been pushed down to the nanometer scale. Advanced quantum transport (QT) solvers are required to accurately simulate such nano-devices. The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism lends itself optimally to these tasks, but it is computationally very intensive, involving the selected inversion (SI) of matrices and the selected solution of quadratic matrix (SQ) equations. Existing algorithms to tackle these numerical problems are ideally suited to GPU acceleration, e.g., the so-called recursive Green's function (RGF) technique, but they are typically sequential, require block-tridiagonal (BT) matrices as inputs, and their implementation has been so far restricted to shared memory parallelism, thus limiting the achievable device sizes. To address these shortcomings, we introduce distributed methods that build on RGF and enable parallel selected inversion and selected solution of the quadratic matrix equation. We further extend them to handle BT matrices with arrowhead, which allows for the investigation of multi-terminal transistor structures. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a real dataset from the QT simulation of a nano-ribbon transistor and compare it with the sparse direct package PARDISO. When scaling to 16 GPUs, our fused SI and SQ solver is 5.2x faster than the SI module of PARDISO applied to a device 16x shorter. These results highlight the potential of our method to accelerate NEGF-based nano-device simulations."

We further evaluate a deployment-time orientation search that selects a discrete rotation maximizing a forest-level confidence proxy without updating model parameters. Orientation search improves robustness under severe rotations but can be harmful near the canonical orientation when confidence is misaligned with correctness. Finally, we observe consistent trends on MNIST digit recognition implemented as one-vs-rest regression, highlighting both the promise and limitations of confidence-based orientation selection for model-tree ensembles."

To overcome the high computational cost of PF in solving complex PDEs, machine learning methods such as PINNs, convLSTM have been used to predict PF evolution. However, current methods still face shortages of low flexibility, poor generalization and short predicting time length. In this work, we present a joint framework coupling voxel-flow network (VFN) with PF simulations in an alternating manner for long-horizon temporal prediction of microstructure evolution. The VFN iteratively predicts future evolution by learning the flow of pixels from past snapshots, with periodic boundaries preserved in the process. Periodical PF simulations suppresses nonphysical artifacts, reduces accumulated error, and extends reliable prediction time length. The VFN is about 1,000 times faster than PF simulation on GPU. In validation using grain growth and spinodal decomposition, MSE and SSIM remain 6.76% and 0.911 when predicted 18 frames from only 2 input frames, outperforming similar predicting methods. For an ultra-long grain growth prediction for 82 frames from 2 input frames, grain number decreases from 600 to 29 with NMSE of average grain area remaining 1.64%. This joint framework enables rapid, generalized, flexible and physically consistent microstructure forecasting from image-based data for ultra-long time scales."

We formalize this problem and introduce \\textbf{DVD} (\\textbf{D}etection via \\textbf{V}ariance of generation \\textbf{D}istribution), a single-sample detector that models the local output distribution induced by temperature sampling. Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \\emph{memory-adherence} state and a \\emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1). Across datasets and models, \\textbf{DVD} consistently outperforms perplexity-based, Min-$k$\\%++, edit-distance (CDD), and embedding-similarity baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness to hyperparameters.

It is known that adding a weak perturbation to the radial potential can strongly disrupt the spectrum of quasinormal modes and Regge poles of a black hole spacetime. Here we examine the effect of (weak or strong) localised delta-function perturbations on the resonant spectra of spherically-symmetric systems, to address fundamental questions around linear and non-linear spectral stability. We examine two cases: the Nariai spacetime with a Poschl-Teller potential and the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that, in either case, the spectrum deforms in a smooth and continuous manner as the position and strength of the perturbation is varied. As the strength of the perturbation is increased, resonances migrate along trajectories in the complex plane which ultimately tend towards attracting points determined by a hard-wall scenario. However, for weak perturbations the trajectory near the unperturbed resonance is typically strongly influenced by a set of repelling points which, for perturbations far from the system, lie very close to the unperturbed resonances; hence there arises a non-linear instability (i.e. the failure of a linearised approximation). Taking a dynamical systems perspective, the sets of attracting and repelling spectral points follow their own trajectories as the position of the perturbation is varied, and these are tracked and understood."

In industrial settings such as pharmaceutical content understanding, practitioners must process long-form videos under strict GPU, latency, and cost constraints, where many existing approaches fail to scale. In this work, we present an industrial GenAI framework that processes over 200,000 PDFs, 25,326 videos across eight formats (e.g., MP4, M4V, etc.), and 888 multilingual audio files in more than 20 languages. Our study makes three contributions: (i) an industrial large-scale architecture for multimodal reasoning in pharmaceutical domains; (ii) empirical analysis of over 40 VLMs on two leading benchmarks (Video-MME and MMBench) and proprietary dataset of 25,326 videos across 14 disease areas; and (iii) four findings relevant to long-form video reasoning: the role of multimodality, attention mechanism trade-offs, temporal reasoning limits, and challenges of video splitting under GPU constraints. Results show 3-8 times efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improving up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), and clear bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across open- and closed-source VLMs. Rather than proposing a new \"A+B\" model, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, and provide actionable guidance for both researchers and practitioners designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains."

Existing works largely focus on optimizing the reasoning paradigms of search agents, yet the quality of intermediate search queries during reasoning remains overlooked. As a result, the generated queries often remain inaccurate, leading to unexpected retrieval results and ultimately limiting search agents' overall effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce SmartSearch, a framework built upon two key mechanisms: (1) Process rewards, which provide fine-grained supervision for the quality of each intermediate search query through Dual-Level Credit Assessment. (2) Query refinement, which promotes the optimization of query generation by selectively refining low-quality search queries and regenerating subsequent search rounds based on these refinements. To enable the search agent to progressively internalize the ability to improve query quality under the guidance of process rewards, we design a three-stage curriculum learning framework. This framework guides the agent through a progression from imitation, to alignment, and ultimately to generalization. Experimental results show that SmartSearch consistently surpasses existing baselines, and additional quantitative analyses further confirm its significant gains in both search efficiency and query quality.

In this study we report rotation measure (RM) variation with orbital phase. We find that the temporal variations in the spectra of Stokes I, Q, and V are generally correlated throughout the orbit, while Stokes U exhibits intervals of both correlation and anticorrelation with Stokes I, depending on the orbital phase. We also provide a Poincare sphere representation of the polarization properties of J2144-5237, demonstrating a systematic temporal change of Poincare sphere location for the main component with orbital phase. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of time-varying properties of the spectro-polarimetric nature of any pulsars or MSPs. Extending this study to probe the spectro-temporal nature of full Stokes data on a larger sample of MSPs or pulsars has the potential to provide vital information on emission mechanisms inside the magnetosphere, interstellar propagation effects, and binary interactions."

It was shown that the local structure of the solution around histamine is determined by local Coulomb interactions and hydrogen bonds and is practically independent of the choice of the water model. Dynamic analysis based on the mean square displacement functions revealed a significant dependence of the diffusion behavior of histamine on the water model. It was found that the TIP3P water model leads to overestimated values of the diffusion coefficients of water and histamine and a transition to the diffusion mode of motion. It was found that the SPC/E water model provides slower dynamics of the solution components, and the values of the diffusion coefficients are in better agreement with experimental data. It was shown that the dynamics of histamine is highly sensitive to the choice of the water model, and the SPC/E model is more suitable for the correct description of the dynamic properties of the ``histamine--water'' system under physiological conditions."

This work presents FibreCastML, an open, distribution-aware ML framework that predicts complete fibre diameter spectra from routinely reported electrospinning parameters and provides interpretable insights into process structure relationships. A meta-dataset comprising 68538 individual fibre diameter measurements extracted from 1778 studies across 16 biomedical polymers was curated. Six standard processing parameters, namely solution concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, tip to collector distance, needle diameter, and collector rotation speed, were used to train seven ML models using nested cross validation with leave one study out external folds. Model interpretability was achieved using variable importance analysis, SHapley Additive exPlanations, correlation matrices, and three dimensional parameter maps. Non linear models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving coefficients of determination above 0.91 for several widely used polymers. Solution concentration emerged as the dominant global driver of fibre diameter distributions. Experimental validation across different electrospinning systems demonstrated close agreement between predicted and measured distributions. FibreCastML enables more reproducible and data driven optimisation of electrospun scaffold architectures."

These allow us to settle the question by showing that the complexity of a curve is exponentially decreased under the iteration of the pull back by a polynomial, and therefore, the pull back of a curve is exponentially contracted to the attractor. In particular, it gives an alternative proof of the finite global attractor conjecture for the polynomial case."

The proposed Virtual Element method features two distinguishing advantages: the construction of an exactly divergence-free discrete velocity field and compatibility with general polygonal meshes. The analysis presented in this work extends a previous work, where only shear-thinning behavior (1 < r < 2) was considered. Indeed, the theoretical analysis of the shear-thickening setting requires several novel analytical tools, including: an inf-sup stability analysis of the discrete velocity-pressure coupling in non-Hilbertian norms, a stabilization term specifically designed to address the nonlinear structure as the exponent r > 2; and the introduction of a suitable discrete norm tailored to the underlying nonlinear constitutive relation. Numerical results demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed formulation."

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach employing task-specific Prompt-Prototype (ProP), thereby eliminating the need for key-value pairs. In our method, task-specific prompts facilitate more effective feature learning for the current task, while corresponding prototypes capture the representative features of the input. During inference, predictions are generated by binding each task-specific prompt with its associated prototype. Additionally, we introduce regularization constraints during prompt initialization to penalize excessively large values, thereby enhancing stability. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In contrast to mainstream prompt-based approaches, our framework removes the dependency on key-value pairs, offering a fresh perspective for future continual learning research."

The proof is based on a weak law of large number for the difference $Δ_n$ between the log-norm of the product of the first $n$ matrices and the sum of their log-norms. This weak law of large numbers morally says that $Δ_n$ behaves like a sum of i.i.d. random variables that have a finite moment of order $2q$ as long as the log-norm of each matrices has a finite moment of order $q$ for a given $q > 0$.

Conversely, initial strategies that interleave retrieval with reasoning often lack global corpus awareness, while Knowledge Graph (KG)-based RAG performs strongly on complex multi-hop tasks but suffers on fact-oriented single-hop queries. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel RAG framework: ToPG (Traversal over Proposition Graphs). ToPG models its knowledge base as a heterogeneous graph of propositions, entities, and passages, effectively combining the granular fact density of propositions with graph connectivity. We leverage this structure using iterative Suggestion-Selection cycles, where the Suggestion phase enables a query-aware traversal of the graph, and the Selection phase provides LLM feedback to prune irrelevant propositions and seed the next iteration. Evaluated on three distinct QA tasks (Simple, Complex, and Abstract QA), ToPG demonstrates strong performance across both accuracy- and quality-based metrics. Overall, ToPG shows that query-aware graph traversal combined with factual granularity is a critical component for efficient structured RAG systems.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive language models are conventionally defined over discrete token sequences, committing to a specific token at every generation step. This early discretization forces uncertainty to be resolved through token-level sampling, often leading to instability, repetition, and sensitivity to decoding heuristics. In this work, we introduce a continuous autoregressive formulation of language generation in which tokens are represented as continuous vectors that \\emph{mature} over multiple update steps before being discretized. Rather than sampling tokens, the model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic dynamical process, committing to a discrete token only when the representation has sufficiently converged. Discrete text is recovered via hard decoding, while uncertainty is maintained and resolved in the continuous space. We show that this maturation process alone is sufficient to produce coherent and diverse text using deterministic decoding (argmax), without reliance on token-level sampling, diffusion-style denoising, or auxiliary stabilization mechanisms. Additional perturbations, such as stochastic dynamics or history smoothing, can be incorporated naturally but are not required for the model to function. To our knowledge, this is the first autoregressive language model that generates text by evolving continuous token representations to convergence prior to discretization, enabling stable generation without token-level sampling."

    "abstract": "Ultametrics are an important class of distances used in applications such as phylogenetics, clustering and classification theory. Ultrametrics are essentially distances that can be represented by an edge-weighted rooted tree so that all of the distances in the tree from the root to any leaf of the tree are equal. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of ultrametrics called arboreal ultrametrics which have applications in phylogenetics and also arise in the theory of distance-hereditary graphs. These are partial distances, that is distances that are not necessarily defined for every pair of elements in the groundset, that can be represented by an ultrametric arboreal network, that is, an edge-weighted rooted network whose underlying graph is a tree. As with ultrametrics all of the distances in the ultrametric arboreal network from any root to any leaf below it are are equal but, in contrast, the network may have more than one root. In our two main results we characterize when a partial distance is an arboreal ultrametric as well as proving that, somewhat surprisingly, given any unrooted edge-weighted phylogenetic tree there is a necessarily unique way to insert roots into this tree so as to obtain an arboreal ultrametric."

    "abstract": "In the last thirty years, the Northern and Central Apennines (Italy) have been affected by three main destructive seismic sequences: the 1997 Colfiorito (three events $M_L > 5.5$), the 2009 L'Aquila (one event $M_L > 5.5$), and the 2016--2017 Amatrice--Visso--Norcia (three events $M_L > 5.5$). Several studies have analysed the spatio-temporal evolution and processes driving each sequence, focusing mainly on the foreshock--mainshock--aftershock periods. Here, we focus on the 2018--2024 interseismic phase, aiming to unravel the long-term seismogenic behaviour of this region. We first relocated the earthquake catalogue and identified clusters through a declustering algorithm. During this phase, background seismicity and most clusters were arranged in a 2--3 km thick low-angle layer. We found that (i) most clusters were driven by aseismic processes, (ii) the depth of both clusters and the seismicity layer increased toward the southeast, (iii) the volume of clusters decreased toward the southeast, and (iv) the low-angle layer almost disappeared in the L'Aquila area. Comparing two interseismic phases (2011--2016 and 2018--2024), we found striking similarities, with events occurring at the same sites and characterized by both foreshock--mainshock--aftershock and swarm-like behaviour. In addition, the L'Aquila area was seismically more silent compared to the northern sites during both interseismic phases. We propose that these different long-term seismogenetic behaviours reflect variations in the structure and rheology of the upper crust from the Northern to the Central Apennines. This highlights the important role of structural inheritance in controlling how active deformation affects the interseismic period."

D $\\textbf{110}$, 023520 (2024)], where C/CP violation arises from the coupling of visible and hidden matter-antimatter sectors through a pseudo-scalar field. Although this mechanism generates baryon number efficiently only after the quark-hadron transition, by incorporating a realistic stochastic PMF within a semi-analytical framework, we find that matching the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry robustly requires PMF strengths of order $10^{10}$ T right after the transition, in agreement with causal QCD-era magnetogenesis. We further reveal that magnetic fluctuations drive the baryon-density spectrum to white noise on large scales, yielding an isocurvature component compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bounds. This establishes a predictive link between the braneworld baryogenesis model and realistic early-Universe magnetic fields."

    "abstract": "Pauli strings are a fundamental computational primitive in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. However, classical computation of Pauli strings suffers from exponential complexity and quickly becomes a performance bottleneck as the number of qubits increases. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Pauli Composer Accelerator (PACOX), the first dedicated FPGA-based accelerator for Pauli string computation. PACOX employs a compact binary encoding with XOR-based index permutation and phase accumulation. Based on this formulation, we design a parallel and pipelined processing element (PE) cluster architecture that efficiently exploits data-level parallelism on FPGA. Experimental results on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA show that PACOX operates at 250 MHz with a dynamic power consumption of 0.33 W, using 8,052 LUTs, 10,934 FFs, and 324 BRAMs. For Pauli strings of up to 19 qubits, PACOX achieves speedups of up to 100 times compared with state-of-the-art CPU-based methods, while requiring significantly less memory and achieving a much lower power-delay product. These results demonstrate that PACOX delivers high computational speed with superior energy efficiency for Pauli-based workloads in hybrid quantum-classical systems."

    "abstract": "Time series decomposition into trend, seasonal structure, and residual components is a core primitive for downstream analytics such as anomaly detection, change-point detection, and forecasting. However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales. We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends. By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade."

    "abstract": "The successful synthesis of few-layer CrI3 has opened new avenues for research in two-dimensional magnetic materials. Owing to its simple crystal structure and excellent physical properties, layered CrI3 has been extensively studied in magneto-optical effects, excitons, tunneling transport, and novel memory devices. However, the most current theoretical studies rely heavily on the first-principles calculations, and a general analytical theoretical framework, particularly for electric-field modulation and transport properties, is still lacking. In this work, using a 28-band tight-binding model combined with linear response theory, we systematically investigate the optoelectronic response for monolayer CrI3 and its nanoribbons. The results demonstrate that: (1) a vertical electric field can selectively close the band gap of one spin channel while the other remains insulating, resulting a transition to an half-metallic state; (2) the electric field dynamically shifts the optical transition peaks, providing a theoretical basis for extracting band parameters from experimental photoconductivity spectra; (3) nanoribbons with different edge morphologies exhibit distinct edge-state distributions and electronic properties, indicating that optical transition can be dynamically modualted through edge design. The theoretical model developed in this study, which can describe external electric field effect, offers an efficient and flexible approach for analytically investigating the CrI3 family and related materials. This model overcomes the limitations of first-principles methods and provides a solid foundation for designing spintronic and optoelectronic devices controlled by electric fields and edge effect."

    "abstract": "An information-theoretic privacy mechanism design is studied, where an agent observes useful data $Y$ which is correlated with the private data $X$. The agent wants to reveal the information to a user, hence, the agent utilizes a privacy mechanism to produce disclosed data $U$ that can be revealed. We assume that the agent has no direct access to $X$, i.e., the private data is hidden. We study privacy mechanism design that maximizes the disclosed information about $Y$, measured by the mutual information between $Y$ and $U$, while satisfying a point-wise constraint with different privacy leakage budgets. We introduce a new measure, called the \\emph{multi-level point-wise leakage}, which allows us to impose different leakage levels for different realizations of $U$. In contrast to previous studies on point-wise measures, which use the same leakage level for each realization, we consider a more general scenario in which each data point can leak information up to a different threshold. As a result, this concept also covers cases in which some data points should not leak any information about the private data, i.e., they must satisfy perfect privacy. In other words, a combination of perfect privacy and non-zero leakage can be considered. When the leakage is sufficiently small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the mutual information. We show that when the leakage matrix $P_{X|Y}$ is invertible, utilizing this approximation leads to a quadratic optimization problem that has closed-form solution under some constraints. In particular, we show that it is sufficient to consider only binary $U$ to attain the optimal utility. This leads to simple privacy designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix."

    "abstract": "With recent advances in generative models, diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems in each domain. Since Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) provide generic priors, several studies have explored their potential as domain-agnostic zero-shot inverse solvers. Despite these efforts, existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from their instability, exhibiting undesirable artifacts and degraded quality. In this work, we first identify the instability as a discrepancy between the solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics, and show that reducing this gap stabilizes the solver. Building on this, we introduce Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC), a theoretically grounded plug-and-play correction module that remedies the LDM-based inverse solvers through measurement-consistent Langevin updates. Compared to prior approaches that rely on linear manifold assumptions, which often do not hold in latent space, MCLC operates without this assumption, leading to more stable and reliable behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of MCLC and its compatibility with existing solvers across diverse image restoration tasks. Additionally, we analyze blob artifacts and offer insights into their underlying causes. We highlight that MCLC is a key step toward more robust zero-shot inverse problem solvers."

    "abstract": "In gyrotropic crystals, an oscillating magnetic field induces a charge response known as the gyrotropic magnetic current. While its conventional origin is attributed to magnetic field modified band energy and shift in the Fermi-surface, a recent study identified an additional spin-driven magnetic displacement contribution. Here, we complete the picture by identifying the orbital counterpart of the magnetic displacement current. Using a density-matrix formulation that incorporates both minimal coupling and spin-Zeeman interactions, we derive the electronic equations of motion in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field and uncover a previously unexplored orbital contribution to the wavepacket velocity. Physically, this contribution arises from the time variation of the magnetic-field induced charge polarization. In the low frequency transport regime, this mechanism becomes purely intrinsic. We illustrate this intrinsic gyrotropic current of orbital origin in the ${\\cal P}{\\cal T}$-symmetric antiferromagnet CuMnAs. We show that the intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current reverses sign upon Néel vector reversal, establishing it as a direct probe of antiferromagnetic order in CuMnAs and other $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets."

We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale. Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning. We further introduce MixDPO, a unified Direct Preference Optimization approach that jointly leverages textual and visual preferences. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL with MixDPO yields consistent improvements, notably in temporal ordering, and transfers effectively to standard video hallucination benchmarks. Code and models will be made publicly available."

For the standard sirens component, we use data from the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0 released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. For GW170817, the only standard siren for which extensive electromagnetic follow-up observations exist, we also use measurements of the host galaxy redshift and inclination angle estimates derived from observations of a superluminal jet from its remnant. Our joint analysis yields $H_0 = 67.9^{+4.4}_{-4.3}$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$, a $6.4\\%$ measurement, while improving the DES constraint on the total abundance of matter $Ω_m$ by $22\\%$. Removing the jet information degrades the $H_0$ precision to $9.9\\%$. The measurement of $H_0$ remains a central problem in cosmology with a multitude of approaches being vigorously pursued in the community aiming to reconcile significantly discrepant measurements at the percent-level. In light of the impending new data releases from DES and LVK, and anticipating much more constraining power from 3$\\times$2pt observables using newly commissioned survey instruments, we demonstrate that incorporating standard sirens into the cosmology framework of large cosmic surveys is a viable route towards that goal."

However, the universality of PL relations is still debated; particularly, the metallicity effect on the Cepheid PL relation. Due to the HIF-stellar photosphere interactions in Cepheids, different period-color (PC) relations at different phases can influence the corresponding PL relations at those phases.We have considered the PL relations at multiple pulsation phases as they capture the ensemble radiation hydrodynamic properties at those phases. We investigate the effect of metallicity on PL relations based on multiphase analysis of classical Cepheid light curves in the MW, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Multiphase metallicity coefficients $(γ)$ are derived in five different photometric bands ($V$, $I$, $G$, $G_{\\rm BP}$, $G_{\\rm RP}$) and two Wesenheit indices ($W_{VI}$, $W_{G}$). We show that the coefficients of multiphase period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations vary dynamically as functions of Cepheid pulsation phases over a complete pulsation cycle. We find significant differences in the $γ_λ$ values between the short- $(0.4 \\leq \\log{P} < 1)$ and long-period $(1 \\leq \\log{P} < 2)$ Cepheids at multiple phases, in two bands, $G_{\\rm RP}$ and $W_{G}$. The weighted averages of the multiphase $γ_λ$ values are found to be in good agreement with the latest results published in the literature. Our methods and results provide new insights into the metallicity effect on the Leavitt law, which can be useful in constraining pulsation models. Additionally, this study shows that the metallicity effect on mean-light PL relations can be recovered from its phase-dependent nature found in this study."

Motivated by the Trans-Planckian problem and potential non-canonical dynamics in the early Universe, we introduce a generalized Sasaki-Mukhanov equation characterized by a time-dependent correction term, parameterized by a coupling constant f. Unlike the standard slow-roll approximation, we derive the exact analytical solutions for the mode functions in terms of Whittaker functions, ensuring a precise treatment of the mode evolution across the horizon. We compute the resulting primordial scalar power spectrum, which exhibits scale-dependent oscillatory modulations and a distinct suppression of power at low multipoles. We numerically implement this modified framework within the Cobaya Bayesian inference engine. Utilizing the latest Planck 2018 temperature and polarization likelihoods combined with high-resolution data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, we perform a robust Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis. Our results place stringent constraints on the modification parameter, |f| <= 10^-4, at a 95% confidence level. However, we find intriguing hints that the generalized model provides a better fit to the low-l CMB spectrum compared to the standard LambdaCDM model, effectively alleviating the low-quadrupole anomaly without compromising the fit at smaller scales. We discuss the implications of these findings for the energy scale of inflation and the validity of the effective field theory description during the inflationary epoch."

The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\\pm \\ell \\hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings. Importantly, the sensing proposals are intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the coherence of the atomic superfluid."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent AI systems have proven effective for complex reasoning. These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow? Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents."

We propose a novel, audio-only SSL framework that explicitly models this hierarchy by jointly learning from frame-level, segment-level, and session-level representations within unsegmented clinical dialogues. Our end-to-end approach dynamically aggregates these multi-granularity features and generates high-quality pseudo-labels to efficiently utilize unlabeled data. Extensive experiments show the framework is model-agnostic, robust across languages and conditions, and highly data-efficient-achieving, for instance, 90\\% of fully-supervised performance using only 11 labeled samples.

To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams.

In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research.

For global error functionals, we derive explicit convergence rates, including logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay, depending on an abstract improvement condition. As a pedagogical example, we study stochastic greedy sampling for one-dimensional piecewise linear interpolation and prove exponential convergence of the $L^1$-interpolation error for $C^2$-functions. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Randomized Polytope Division Method (R-PDM), a randomized variant of the classical Polytope Division Method, and demonstrate its effectiveness and variance reduction in numerical experiments"

While spin selectivity has been widely investigated, its quantum coherence has not yet been explored. Here, we investigate spin-dependent photoluminescence (PL) dynamics in multilayer quantum-dot (QD) assemblies coupled by chiral linkers. Using circularly polarized excitation in the presence of an external magnetic field, we observe a pronounced modulation of the PL lifetime that depends on the magnetic field magnitude and geometry. The lifetime difference between left- and right-circularly polarized excitations exhibits a field-angle dependence, consistent with spin precession driven by the transverse magnetic-field component relative to the chiral axis. A model incorporating coupled spin precession and decay processes reproduces the experimental trends. These results establish chiral QD assemblies as a room-temperature platform for probing quantum coherent manifestations of the CISS effect, with implications for spintronic and quantum technologies."

Therefore, we investigate the influence of network composition and environmental conditions on the structure and mechanical and adhesive properties of thin films composed of hydrophobic tetra-PCL and hydrophilic tetra-PEG stars of varying sizes. State-of-the-art atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques, including phase imaging, fast quantitative static indentation and dynamic indentation, provide insights into the structure-property-relationship on various length scales. PEG-rich networks exhibit amorphous morphologies with spherical nanodomains and elastic moduli of a few MPa, while PCL-rich networks form semicrystalline cylindrical arrangements with moduli up to several hundred MPa in water. Temperature-dependent measurements in water revealed a strong hysteresis of elastic moduli while shifting the melting/crystallization transitions or preventing crystallization in PEG-rich networks. All networks displayed predominantly elastic behavior. Co-networks in non-selective solvent conditions are overall softer, less adhesive and structurally more homogeneous. These results establish a predictable correlation of network composition, physical and chemical environment, structure and properties, which makes them suitable for a rational design of amphiphilic systems for various applications."

While hallucination detection has recently emerged as a priority in English-centric benchmarks, low-to-medium resource languages such as Vietnamese remain inadequately covered by standardized evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations. The dataset incorporates three prompt types -- factual, noisy, and adversarial -- to stress-test model robustness. A total of 111 teams participated, with the best-performing system achieving a macro-F1 score of 84.80\\%, compared to a baseline encoder-only score of 32.83\\%, demonstrating that instruction-tuned LLMs with structured prompting and ensemble strategies substantially outperform generic architectures. However, the gap to perfect performance indicates that hallucination detection remains a challenging problem, particularly for intrinsic (contradiction-based) hallucinations. This work establishes a rigorous benchmark and explores a diverse range of detection methodologies, providing a foundation for future research into the trustworthiness and reliability of Vietnamese language AI systems."

A Hecke vector-form can be viewed as a vector function representation of some quasiautomorphic form that transforms like an automorphic form on an arbitrarily chosen Hecke triangle group. In other words, because quasiautomorphic forms have complicated transformation behavior when compared with automorphic forms, the construction of a Hecke vector-form is to retrieve a transformation behavior analogous to the simpler, automorphic case. In this way, a Hecke vector-form can be viewed as the vector function analogue of an automorphic form. Since our work is for any quasi-automorphic form over an arbitrary Hecke triangle group, we briefly review the construction of such groups. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the hauptmodul, the automorphic forms, and the normalized quasiautomorphic form of weight 2 for any Hecke triangle group. We then proceed to the theory of Hecke vector-forms and establish the desired transformation behavior with respect to the generators of the associated group. A proof of this fact is strictly elementary, relying on fine properties of binomial coefficients. Lastly, we relate the vector-forms to Hecke automorphic linear differential equations, which are analogues of the frequently researched modular linear differential equations. Our results include Hecke vector-forms of the classical quasimodular forms as the simplest case."

In a first implementation, the experiment yielded 18000 s of analyzable data at room temperature under high vacuum with optical readout and triple-layer magnetic shielding. A likelihood-based statistical framework, incorporating stochastic fluctuations in the axion-field amplitude, was used to evaluate the data. No excess consistent with an axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field was observed near 2e-14 eV. To account for possible shielding-induced signal attenuation, we quantify its effect and report both the uncorrected (g_aee < 1e-7) and attenuation-corrected (g_aee < 6e-5) 90% CL limits on the axion-electron coupling. Looking ahead, improvements guided by both noise-budget analysis and shielding-attenuation considerations, including optimized levitation geometry, cryogenic operation, and superconducting shielding, are expected to boost sensitivity by multiple orders of magnitude."

Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are leading candidates for quantum generative modeling and have been applied to diverse areas, from high-energy physics to image generation. The latent style-based QGAN, relying on a classical variational autoencoder to encode the input data into a latent space and then using a style-based QGAN for data generation has been proven to be efficient for image generation or drug design, hinting at the use of far less trainable parameters than their classical counterpart to achieve comparable performance, however this advantage has never been systematically studied. We present in this work the first comprehensive experimental analysis of this advantage of QGANS applied to SAT4 image generation, obtaining an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for a quantum generator in the hybrid latent style-based QGAN architecture. Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator. This hints toward a type of quantum advantage for quantum generative modeling."

This applies in particular when the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) becomes operable in 2027, which is expected to close an important gap in our understanding of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and other areas of astrophysics. To this end, foreground objects, contaminants of the 21-cm signal, need to be identified and subtracted. Source finding and identification is thus an important albeit challenging task. We investigate the ability of AI and deep learning (DL) methods that have been previously trained on other data domains to localize and classify radio galaxies with minimal changes to their architectures. Various well-known pretrained neural network architectures for image classification and object detection are trained and fine-tuned and their performance is evaluated on a public radio galaxy dataset derived from the Radio Galaxy Zoo. A comparison between convolutional neural network (CNN)- and transformer-based algorithms is performed. The best performing architecture is systematically optimized and an uncertainty estimation is performed by means of an ensemble analysis. Radio source classification performance nearly comparable to the current leading customized models can be obtained using existing standard pretrained DL architectures, without modification and increase in complexity of the model architectures but rather adaptation of the data, by combining various transformations on replicated image channels. Using an ensemble of models can also further improve performance to over 90% accuracy, on par with top-performing models in the literature. The results can be transferred to other survey data, e.g. from the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA), and in the future be used to study the EoR with the SKAO."

This study assesses the feasibility of ssRIS deployment by analyzing two harvest-and-reflect (HaR) schemes: element-splitting (ES) and time-splitting (TS). We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness."

However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings."

In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers. If PBHs constitute the majority of dark matter, the induced GW leaves a strong signal in the mHz band with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10^3\\sim10^4$."

Recent experiments and theoretical studies have demonstrated the crucial roles of T-type and L-type calcium currents in shaping the activity patterns of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons. However, the role of these currents in the generation of synchronized activity patterns in BG networks involving STN is still unknown. In this study, using an STN model incorporating T-type and L-type calcium currents, we examined how these currents shape the patterns of neural activity in the subthalamo-pallidal network, including network dynamics in response to periodic external inputs. The dynamics were studied in relation to the network connectivity parameters - modulated by dopamine (depleted in PD's BG) - and compared with the properties of the temporal patterning of synchronous neural activity previously observed in the experimental studies with Parkinsonian patients. Stronger T-type current enhanced post-inhibitory rebound bursting and expanded synchronized rhythmic activity, reducing the range of intermittent synchrony and increasing resistance to external entrainment. Stronger L-type current prolonged STN bursts, promoted intermittent synchrony over a wide range of input amplitudes, and sustained beta oscillations, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of PD. These results highlight the interplay between intrinsic cellular properties, synaptic parameters, and external inputs in shaping pathological synchronized rhythms in BG networks. Understanding these network mechanisms may advance the understanding of Parkinsonian rhythmogenesis and further assist in finding ways to modulate and suppress pathological rhythms."

To overcome multi-view inconsistencies caused by underwater optical degradation, our method enforces trinocular view consistency by rendering horizontally and vertically translated camera views relative to each input view and aligning them via inverse warping. Furthermore, these translated camera views are used to derive a synthetic epipolar depth prior through triangulation, which serves as a self-supervised depth regularizer. These geometric constraints facilitate the spatial optimization of 3D Gaussians and preserve scene structure in underwater environments. We also propose a depth-aware alpha adjustment that modulates the opacity of 3D Gaussians during early training based on their $z$-component and viewing direction, deterring the formation of medium-induced primitives. With our contributions, 3D Gaussians are disentangled from the scattering medium, enabling robust representation of object geometry and significantly reducing floating artifacts in reconstructed underwater scenes. Experiments on real-world underwater and simulated scenes demonstrate that OceanSplat substantially outperforms existing methods for both scene reconstruction and restoration in scattering media."

Due to the complexity of building a fullsized prototype in the nuclear field, most of the experiments are performed on reduced-sized models but it may lead to scale effects. Such scale effects are under study in this paper, focusing on a critical issue in SFR reactor, which is the rising of the jet outgoing the core at low power. For this purpose, a scale effects methodology is detailed, using the SFR's reduced scale mock-up MICAS as the reference scale. To achieve that, dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations under Boussinesq's approximation are considered and the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem is applied to determine the most relevant dimensionless numbers, among them the densimetric Froude number. Experimental campaigns have been performed to measure velocity fields using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Their analysis clearly shown dependency of mean pathway of the jet on this dimensionless number. Particularly, plotting the jet angle as a function of the normalized densimetric Froude number, a change of behaviour for a threshold value of 0.45 has been observed.

    "abstract": "Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits relies on a transverse capacitive coupling that hybridizes the qubit with the readout resonator, subjecting the qubit to Purcell decay and measurement-induced state transitions (MIST). Despite the widespread use of Purcell filters to suppress qubit decay and near-quantum-limited amplifiers, dispersive readout often lags behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate junction readout, a simple readout architecture that realizes a strong qubit-resonator cross-Kerr interaction without relying on a transverse coupling. This interaction is achieved by coupling a transmon qubit to its readout resonator through both a capacitance and a Josephson junction. By varying the qubit frequency, we show that this hybrid coupling provides intrinsic Purcell protection and enhanced resilience to MIST, enabling readout at high photon numbers. While junction readout is compatible with conventional linear measurement, in this work we exploit the nonlinear coupling to intentionally engineer a large Kerr nonlinearity in the resonator, enabling bifurcation-based readout. Using this approach, we achieve a 99.4 % assignment fidelity with a 68 ns integration time and a 98.4 % QND fidelity without an external Purcell filter or a near-quantum-limited amplifier. These results establish the junction readout architecture with bifurcation-based readout as a scalable and practical alternative to dispersive readout, enabling fast, high-fidelity qubit measurement with reduced hardware overhead."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-aided cell-free multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system. In this system, each distributed access point (AP) can flexibly adjust its array orientation and antenna positions to adapt to spatial channel variations and enhance communication performance. However, frequent antenna movements and centralized beamforming based on global instantaneous channel state information (CSI) sharing among APs entail extremely high signal processing delay and system overhead, which is difficult to be practically implemented in high-mobility scenarios with short channel coherence time. To address these practical implementation challenges and improve scalability, a two-timescale decentralized optimization framework is proposed in this paper to jointly design the beamformer, antenna positions, and array orientations. In the short timescale, each AP updates its receive beamformer based on local instantaneous CSI and global statistical CSI. In the long timescale, the central processing unit optimizes the antenna positions and array orientations at all APs based on global statistical CSI to maximize the ergodic sum rate of all users. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and involves highly coupled variables, thus posing significant challenges for obtaining efficient solutions. To address this problem, a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation algorithm is developed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed 6DMA-aided cell-free system with decentralized beamforming significantly outperforms other antenna movement schemes with less flexibility and even achieves a performance comparable to that of the centralized beamforming benchmark."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of personalization in large language models (LLMs). Prior work predominantly represents user preferences as implicit, model-specific vectors or parameters, yielding opaque ``black-box'' profiles that are difficult to interpret and transfer across models and tasks. In contrast, we advocate natural language as a universal, model- and task-agnostic interface for preference representation. The formulation leads to interpretable and reusable preference descriptions, while naturally supporting continual evolution as new interactions are observed. To learn such representations, we introduce a two-stage training framework that combines supervised fine-tuning on high-quality synthesized data with reinforcement learning to optimize long-term utility and cross-task transferability. Based on this framework, we develop AlignXplore+, a universal preference reasoning model that generates textual preference summaries. Experiments on nine benchmarks show that our 8B model achieves state-of-the-art performanc -- outperforming substantially larger open-source models -- while exhibiting strong transferability across tasks, model families, and interaction formats."

We analyze intraday transition dynamics of ask and bid orders across market capitalization tiers using high-frequency NASDAQ100 tick data. Employing a discrete-time Markov chain framework, we categorize consecutive price changes into nine states and estimate transition probability matrices (TPMs) for six intraday intervals across High ($\\mathtt{HMC}$), Medium ($\\mathtt{MMC}$), and Low ($\\mathtt{LMC}$) market cap stocks. Element-wise TPM comparison reveals systematic patterns: price inertia peaks during opening and closing hours, stabilizing midday. A capitalization gradient is observed: $\\mathtt{HMC}$ stocks exhibit the strongest inertia, while $\\mathtt{LMC}$ stocks show lower stability and wider spreads. Markov metrics, including spectral gap, entropy rate, and mean recurrence times, quantify these dynamics. Clustering analysis identifies three distinct temporal phases on the bid side -- Opening, Midday, and Closing, and four phases on the ask side by distinguishing Opening, Midday, Pre-Close, and Close. This indicates that sellers initiate end-of-day positioning earlier than buyers. Stationary distributions show limit order dynamics are dominated by neutral and mild price changes. Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the closing hour as the most distinct phase, with capitalization modulating temporal contrasts and bid-ask asymmetry. These findings support capitalization-aware and time-adaptive execution algorithms."

Often, an imbalanced majority class can dominate training to skew classifier performance towards the majority outcome. To address this problem we introduce cardinality augmented loss functions, derived from cardinality-like invariants in modern mathematics literature such as magnitude and the spread. These invariants enrich the concept of cardinality by evaluating the `effective diversity' of a metric space, and as such represent a natural solution to overly homogeneous training data. In this work, we establish a methodology for applying cardinality augmented loss functions in the training of neural networks and report results on both artificially imbalanced datasets as well as a real-world imbalanced material science dataset. We observe significant performance improvement among minority classes, as well as improvement in overall performance metrics."

By deploying a large field-of-view with high-multiplex Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) on a large aperture telescope, one can instantaneously cover neutrino error circles, thus providing crucial spectroscopic classifications of potential counterparts discovered, for example, by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST) with unprecedented efficiency. Furthermore, simultaneous operation of a giant panoramic central Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) would allow for detailed kinematic and environmental characterization of primary candidates.

The full Run 2 data sample recorded with the ATLAS detector in the years 2015-2018 is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. The absolute and normalised production cross-sections are measured differentially as a function of the transverse momentum and absolute rapidity of the top quark and top antiquark. In addition, the ratio of top quark to top antiquark production cross-sections is measured. The measured distributions are compared with next-to-leading-order quantum chromodynamics predictions obtained with different combinations of matrix-element generators, parton-shower programs and proton parton distribution functions, as well as to next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations. Overall, good agreement is observed between the measurements and the theoretical predictions. For most measured distributions, the sensitivity to differences between the predictions is limited by the systematic uncertainties in the measurement. The measured differential distributions are also interpreted in an effective field theory approach to constrain the Wilson-Coefficient $C_{Qq}^{3,1}$ associated with a four-quark operator. The interpretation accounts for the effect of the selection efficiency, which is altered significantly by non-zero contributions from $C_{Qq}^{3,1}$."

    "abstract": "Biological and biomedical samples are routinely examined using focused two-photon (2P) fluorescence microscopy due to its intrinsic axial sectioning and reduced out-of-focus bleaching. However, 2P imaging often requires excitation intensities that can damage samples through ionization and radical formation. Additionally, the lateral resolution of 2P microscopy is lower compared to linear one-photon (1P) fluorescence microscopy. Widefield 2P microscopy, using cameras, holds promise for reducing photo-toxicity while maintaining high image acquisition rates. Widefield imaging trades the high power and short integration times of sequential single point scanning for the low power and extended integration times of parallel detection across millions of pixels. However, generating effective axial sectioning over arbitrarily large fields of view (FOVs) has remained a challenge. In this work, we introduce 2P Random Illumination Microscopy (2P-RIM), an easy-to-implement 2P widefield technique, that achieves low photo-damage, fast imaging, micrometric axial sectioning, and enhanced lateral resolution for arbitrarily large FOVs. By using widefield speckled illuminations in conjunction with an image standard deviation matching algorithm, 2P-RIM demonstrated multicolor imaging over FOVs greater than 200 um, lateral resolution 220 nm, axial sectioning 2 um, and peak excitation powers about 10 times lower than those used in focused laser scanning microscopy."

This paper presents a case study of using ChatGPT for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE (Event-based Lunar OPtical flow Egomotion estimation) competition. The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing. At the same time, we observed limitations: the model often introduced unnecessary structural changes, gets confused by intermediate discussions about alternative ideas, occasionally produced critical errors and forgets important aspects in longer scientific discussions. By analyzing these strengths and shortcomings, we show how conversational AI can both accelerate development and support conceptual insight in scientific research. We argue that structured integration of LLMs into the scientific workflow can enhance rapid prototyping by proposing best practices for AI-assisted scientific work."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of network technologies, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have emerged to deliver increasingly precise and tailored personalized learning services. Cognitive diagnosis (CD) has emerged as a core research task in ITS, aiming to infer learners' mastery of specific knowledge concepts by modeling the mapping between learning behavior data and knowledge states. However, existing research prioritizes model performance enhancement while neglecting the pervasive noise contamination in observed response data, significantly hindering practical deployment. Furthermore, current cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) rely heavily on researchers' domain expertise for structural design, which fails to exhaustively explore architectural possibilities, thus leaving model architectures' full potential untapped. To address this issue, we propose OSCD, an evolutionary multi-objective One-Shot neural architecture search method for Cognitive Diagnosis, designed to efficiently and robustly improve the model's capability in assessing learner proficiency. Specifically, OSCD operates through two distinct stages: training and searching. During the training stage, we construct a search space encompassing diverse architectural combinations and train a weight-sharing supernet represented via the complete binary tree topology, enabling comprehensive exploration of potential architectures beyond manual design priors. In the searching stage, we formulate the optimal architecture search under heterogeneous noise scenarios as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), and develop an optimization framework integrating a Pareto-optimal solution search strategy with cross-scenario performance evaluation for resolution. Extensive experiments on real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the optimal architectures discovered by our OSCD model for CD tasks."

A mean temperature over the virtual temperatures of adjacent energy levels is defined to compare the passive states of the system resulting from isoenergetic and isoentropic transformations. The role of the minimum and the maximum (min-max) values of the virtual temperatures in determining the direction of heat flow between the system and the environment is argued based on majorization relations. We characterize the intermediate passive states in a quantum Otto engine using these virtual temperatures and derive an upper bound for the Otto efficiency that can be expressed in terms of the min-max virtual temperatures of the working medium. An explicit example of the coupled-spins system is worked out. Moreover, virtual temperatures serve to draw interesting parallels between the quantum thermodynamic processes and their classical counterparts. Thus, virtual temperature emerges as a key operational quantity linking passivity and majorization to the optimal performance of quantum thermal machines."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on standard visual reasoning benchmarks. However, there is growing concern that these models rely excessively on linguistic shortcuts rather than genuine visual grounding, a phenomenon we term Text Bias. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental tension between visual perception and linguistic priors. We decouple the sources of this bias into two dimensions: Internal Corpus Bias, stemming from statistical correlations in pretraining, and External Instruction Bias, arising from the alignment-induced tendency toward sycophancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce V-FAT (Visual Fidelity Against Text-bias), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 4,026 VQA instances across six semantic domains. V-FAT employs a Three-Level Evaluation Framework that systematically increases the conflict between visual evidence and textual information: (L1) internal bias from atypical images, (L2) external bias from misleading instructions, and (L3) synergistic bias where both coincide. We introduce the Visual Robustness Score (VRS), a metric designed to penalize \"lucky\" linguistic guesses and reward true visual fidelity. Our evaluation of 12 frontier MLLMs reveals that while models excel in existing benchmarks, they experience significant visual collapse under high linguistic dominance."

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid development of quantum science and technology, errors are inevitable and play a crucial role in quantum simulation and quantum computation. In quantum chaotic systems, coherent errors arising from imperfect Hamiltonian control and incoherent errors induced by coupling to the environment are both exponentially amplified during time evolution due to information scrambling. A fundamental question is how these two classes of errors imprint distinct signatures on the emergent irreversibility of many-body dynamics. In this Letter, we address this question by investigating multi-round time-reversed dynamics in the presence of both coherent and incoherent errors. By applying scramblon theory, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Loschmidt echo over different rounds of time-reversed evolution. For incoherent errors, the error accumulates linearly with the number of rounds, whereas coherent errors exhibit a crossover from quadratic to linear accumulation. These predictions are explicitly verified using the solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for characterizing and calibrating coherent and incoherent errors in reversed dynamics, with particular relevance to nuclear magnetic resonance systems."

Specifically, we design a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent capable of learning adaptive power control policies directly from channel state observations, effectively bypassing the need for explicit system models. We formulate the resource allocation problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and benchmark the proposed approach against classical heuristics, including fixed allocation, random assignment, and the theoretical water-filling algorithm. Empirical results demonstrate that the DQN agent achieves a system throughput of 3.88 Mbps, effectively matching the upper limit of the water fill, while outperforming the random and fixed allocation strategies by approximately 73% and 27%, respectively. Moreover, the agent exhibits emergent fairness, maintaining a Jain's Index of 0.91, and successfully optimizes the trade-off between spectral efficiency and energy consumption. These findings substantiate the efficacy of model-free DRL as a robust and scalable solution for resource management in next-generation communication systems."

Estimating when a document was written and tracing the development of scripts and writing styles can be aided by identifying the individual scribes who contributed to a medieval manuscript. Although digital technologies have made significant progress in this field, the general problem remains unsolved and continues to pose open challenges. ... We previously proposed an approach focused on identifying specific letters or abbreviations that characterize each writer. In that study, we considered the letter \"a\", as it was widely present on all pages of text and highly distinctive, according to the suggestions of expert paleographers. We used template matching techniques to detect the occurrences of the character \"a\" on each page and the convolutional neural network (CNN) to attribute each instance to the correct scribe. Moving from the interesting results achieved from this previous system and being aware of the limitations of the template matching technique, which requires an appropriate threshold to work, we decided to experiment in the same framework with the use of the YOLO object detection model to identify the scribe who contributed to the writing of different medieval books. We considered the fifth version of YOLO to implement the YOLO object detection model, which completely substituted the template matching and CNN used in the previous work. The experimental results demonstrate that YOLO effectively extracts a greater number of letters considered, leading to a more accurate second-stage classification. Furthermore, the YOLO confidence score provides a foundation for developing a system that applies a rejection threshold, enabling reliable writer identification even in unseen manuscripts."

    "abstract": "Error mitigation (EM) methods are crucial for obtaining reliable results in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, where noise significantly impacts output accuracy. Some EM protocols are particularly efficient for specific types of noise. Yet the noise in the actual hardware may not align with that. In this article, we introduce Noise Tailoring (NT) -- an innovative strategy designed to modify the structure of the noise associated with two-qubit gates through statistical sampling. We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise. We propose to use the NT method for characterizing such error sources on quantum computers in order to inform hardware development."

    "abstract": "Free-surface flow is relevant to many researchers in water resources engineering, geohazard assessment, as well as coastal and river engineering. Many different free-surface models have been proposed, which span modeling complexity from the hydrostatic Saint-Venant equations to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Particularly efficient methods can be derived by depth-averaging, resulting in dimensionally reduced models. Typically, this yields hierarchies of models -- models with a variable system structure depending on the polynomial expansion of the flow variables -- that need to be analyzed and numerically solved. This description, analysis, and simulation are challenging, and existing software solutions only cover a specific subset of models generated by these hierarchies. We propose a new software framework to address this issue. Zoomy allows for an efficient description, symbolic analysis, and numerical solution of depth-averaged hierarchies of free-surface flow models. Zoomy handles a numerical discretization in one- and two-dimensional space on unstructured grids. With this framework, systematic evaluation of hierarchies of depth-averaged free-surface flows becomes feasible. Additionally, our open-source framework increases the accessibility of these depth-averaged systems to application engineers interested in efficient methods for free-surface flows."

However, most existing content-based video retrieval benchmarks focus on scene-level similarity and do not evaluate the action discrimination required in surveillance. To address this gap, we introduce SOVABench (Surveillance Opposite Vehicle Actions Benchmark), a real-world retrieval benchmark built from surveillance footage and centered on vehicle-related actions. SOVABench defines two evaluation protocols (inter-pair and intra-pair) to assess cross-action discrimination and temporal direction understanding. Although action distinctions are generally intuitive for human observers, our experiments show that they remain challenging for state-of-the-art vision and multimodal models. Leveraging the visual reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we present a training-free framework for producing interpretable embeddings from MLLM-generated descriptions for both images and videos. The framework achieves strong performance on SOVABench as well as on several spatial and counting benchmarks where contrastive Vision-Language Models often fail. The code, annotations, and instructions to construct the benchmark are publicly available."

    "abstract": "Restarting a stochastic search process can accelerate its completion by providing an opportunity to take a more favorable path with each reset. This strategy, known as stochastic resetting, is well studied in random processes. Here, we introduce chaotic resetting, a fundamentally different resetting strategy designed for deterministic chaotic systems. Unlike stochastic resetting, where randomness is intrinsic to the dynamics, chaotic resetting exploits the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions inherent to chaotic motion: unavoidable uncertainties in the reset conditions effectively generate new realizations of the deterministic process. This extension is nontrivial because some realizations may significantly speed up the search, while others may significantly slow it down. We study the conditions required for chaotic resetting to be consistently advantageous, concluding that it requires the presence of a mixed phase space in which fractal and smooth regions coexist. We quantify its effectiveness by demonstrating substantial reductions in average search times when an optimal resetting interval is used. These results establish a clear conceptual bridge between deterministic chaos and search optimization, opening new avenues for accelerating processes in real-world chaotic systems where perfect control or knowledge of initial conditions is unattainable."

    "abstract": "The development of category theory in univalent foundations and the formalization thereof is an active field of research. Categories in that setting are often assumed to be univalent which means that identities and isomorphisms of objects coincide. One consequence hereof is that equivalences and identities coincide for univalent categories and that structure on univalent categories transfers along equivalences. However, constructions such as the Kleisli category, the Karoubi envelope, and the tripos-to-topos construction, do not necessarily give univalent categories. To deal with that problem, one uses the Rezk completion, which completes a category into a univalent one. However, to use the Rezk completion when considering categories with structure, one also needs to show that the Rezk completion inherits the structure from the original category. In this work, we present a modular framework for lifting the Rezk completion from categories to categories with structure. We demonstrate the modularity of our framework by lifting the Rezk completion from categories to elementary topoi in manageable steps."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled way to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet its effectiveness hinges on training signals that remain informative as models evolve. In practice, RL progress often slows when task difficulty becomes poorly aligned with model capability, or when training is dominated by a narrow set of recurring problem patterns. To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training. Extensive experiments show that SCALER consistently outperforms dataset-based RL baselines across diverse reasoning benchmarks and exhibits more stable, long-horizon training dynamics."

    "abstract": "Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a promising approach for combining the learning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretable reasoning of symbolic systems. However, existing NeSy frameworks typically require either predefined symbolic policies or policies that are differentiable, limiting their applicability when domain expertise is unavailable or when policies are inherently non-differentiable. We propose a framework that addresses this limitation by enabling the concurrent learning of both non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural network weights through an evolutionary process. Our approach casts NeSy systems as organisms in a population that evolve through mutations (both symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes), with fitness-based selection guiding convergence toward hidden target policies. The framework extends the NEUROLOG architecture to make symbolic policies trainable, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework to the NeSy context, and employs Machine Coaching semantics for mutable symbolic representations. Neural networks are trained through abductive reasoning from the symbolic component, eliminating differentiability requirements. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that NeSy systems starting with empty policies and random neural weights can successfully approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving median correct performance approaching 100%. This work represents a step toward enabling NeSy research in domains where the acquisition of symbolic knowledge from experts is challenging or infeasible."

    "abstract": "The passivity index, a quantitative measure of a system's passivity deficiency or excess, has been widely used in stability analysis and control. Existing studies mostly rely on scalar forms of indices, which are restrictive for multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems. This paper extends the classical scalar indices to a systematic matrix-valued framework, referred to as passivity matrices. A broad range of classical results in passivity theory can be naturally generalized in this framework. We first show that, under the matrix representation, passivity indices essentially correspond to the curvature of the dissipativity functional under a second-variation interpretation. This result reveals that the intrinsic geometric structure of passivity consists of its directions and intensities, which a scalar index cannot fully capture. For linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, we examine the structural properties of passivity matrices with respect to the Loewner partial order and propose two principled criteria for selecting representative matrices. Compared with conventional scalar indices, the matrix-valued indices capture the passivity coupling among different input-output channels in MIMO systems and provide a more comprehensive description of system passivity. This richer information leads to lower passivation effort and less conservative stability assessment."

    "abstract": "As LLM agents transition from digital assistants to physical controllers in autonomous systems and robotics, they face an escalating threat from indirect prompt injection. By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods. Code is available at GitHub."

To address the inefficiency of manual convexification and the over-reliance on expert knowledge, we propose NC2C, an LLM-based end-to-end automated framework designed to transform generic non-convex optimization problems into solvable convex forms using large language models. NC2C leverages LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities to autonomously detect non-convex components, select optimal convexification strategies, and generate rigorous convex equivalents. The framework integrates symbolic reasoning, adaptive transformation techniques, and iterative validation, equipped with error correction loops and feasibility domain correction mechanisms to ensure the robustness and validity of transformed problems. Experimental results on a diverse dataset of 100 generic non-convex problems demonstrate that NC2C achieves an 89.3\\% execution rate and a 76\\% success rate in producing feasible, high-quality convex transformations. This outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin, highlighting NC2C's ability to leverage LLMs for automated non-convex to convex transformation, reduce expert dependency, and enable efficient deployment of convex solvers for previously intractable optimization tasks."

Previous studies showed that adding congruent thermal feedback positively influences User eXperience (UX). However, existing work did not compare different levels of thermal feedback quality and mostly used less immersive virtual environments. To investigate these gaps in the scientific literature, we conducted a within-participant user study in two highly-immersive scenarios, Desert Island (n=25) and Snowy Mountains (n=24). Participants explored the scenarios in three conditions (Audio-Visual only, Static-Thermal Feedback, and Dynamic-Thermal Feedback). To assess the complex and subtle effects of thermal feedback on UX, we performed a multimodal analysis by crossing data from questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and behavioral indicators. Our results show that despite an already high level of presence in the Audio-Visual only condition, adding thermal feedback increased presence further. Comparison between levels of thermal feedback quality showed no significant difference in UX questionnaires, however this result is nuanced according to participant profiles and interviews. Furthermore, we show that although the order of passage did not influence UX directly, it influenced user behavior. We propose guidelines for the use of thermal feedback in VR, and the design of studies in complex multisensory scenarios."

While deep learning-based reconstruction methods have accelerated MRI, their predominant supervised paradigm depends on fully-sampled reference data that are challenging to acquire. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have emerged as promising alternatives, but most are empirically designed and fragmented. Therefore, we introduce UNITS (Unified Theory for Self-supervision), a general framework for self-supervised MRI reconstruction. UNITS unifies prior SSL strategies within a common formalism, enabling consistent interpretation and systematic benchmarking. We prove that SSL can achieve the same expected performance as supervised learning. Under this theoretical guarantee, we introduce sampling stochasticity and flexible data utilization, which improve network generalization under out-of-domain distributions and stabilize training. Together, these contributions establish UNITS as a theoretical foundation and a practical paradigm for interpretable, generalizable, and clinically applicable self-supervised MRI reconstruction."

The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$. Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's \"relational color refinement\" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$. Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size."

As a consequence, we derive new sharp partial $C^1$ regularity results under the assumption that $G$ is degenerate only on curves. This is done by exploiting the hyperbolic structure of the equation along these curves, where the loss of regularity is compensated using tools from the theories of Hamilton-Jacobi equations and scalar conservation laws.

Among its key performance metrics especially for time-resolved studies, sensitivity and measurement speed are paramount. However, a long-standing compromise between these parameters arises from the need for noise reduction. Here, we introduce a comb spectroscopy system that overcomes this limitation using a single frequency comb of non-uniformly spaced modes. The comb is generated using an extremely simple setup, composed of a continuous-wave (CW) fiber laser and a single-sideband phase modulator (SSM). Our approach delivers optical-to-radio-frequency conversion comparable to dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) but through a simplified self-heterodyning architecture. By leveraging the intrinsic mutual coherence of the comb, this design achieves a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient (NEA) of 5.0*10^(-6) Hz^(-1/2)--an order-of-magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art DCS, coupled with long-term stability. The system resolves weak molecular overtone spectra on nanosecond timescales, in a single-shot measurement, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 128. This integration of high sensitivity, resolution, and speed resolves the core trade-off that has long constrained time-resolved spectroscopic analysis."

First, we study hallucinations in closed-book question answering on HotpotQA and find a directional effect: negating the hallucination token reduces hallucinated answers mainly by increasing abstentions, whereas asserting it increases hallucinations and lowers precision. Second, we induce recasting, a pedagogical feedback strategy for second language teaching, and observe the same directional effect. Moreover, compared to providing the full definitional corpus in-context, concept tokens better preserve compliance with other instructions (e.g., asking follow-up questions). Finally, we include a qualitative study with the Eiffel Tower and a fictional \"Austral Tower\" to illustrate what information the learned embeddings capture and where their limitations emerge. Overall, Concept Tokens provide a compact control signal learned from definitions that can steer behavior in frozen LLMs."

    "abstract": "The graph alignment problem aims to identify the vertex correspondence between two correlated graphs. Most existing studies focus on the scenario in which the two graphs share the same vertex set. However, in many real-world applications, such as computer vision, social network analysis, and bioinformatics, the task often involves locating a small graph pattern within a larger graph. Existing graph alignment algorithms and analysis cannot directly address these scenarios because they are not designed to identify the specific subset of vertices where the small graph pattern resides within the larger graph. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the subgraph alignment problem, which seeks to recover both the vertex set and/or the vertex correspondence of a small graph pattern embedded in a larger graph. In the special case where the small graph pattern is an induced subgraph of the larger graph and both the vertex set and correspondence are to be recovered, the problem reduces to the subgraph isomorphism problem, which is NP-complete in the worst case. In this paper, we formally formulate the subgraph alignment problem by proposing the Erdos-Renyi subgraph pair model together with some appropriate recovery criterion. We then establish almost-tight information-theoretic results for the subgraph alignment problem and present some novel approaches for the analysis."

Understanding the notion of inference captured by NLI is key to interpreting model performance on the task. In this paper we formulate three possible readings of the NLI label set and perform a comprehensive analysis of the meta-inferential properties they entail. Focusing on the SNLI dataset, we exploit (1) NLI items with shared premises and (2) items generated by LLMs to evaluate models trained on SNLI for meta-inferential consistency and derive insights into which reading of the logical relations is encoded by the dataset."

    "abstract": "We show that a general class of social impact models with higher-order interactions on hypergraphs can be exactly reduced to an equivalent model with pairwise interactions on a weighted projected network. This reduction is made by a mapping that preserves the microscopic probabilities of changing the state of the nodes. As a particular case, we introduce hypergraph-voter models, for which we compute the weights of the projected network both analytically and numerically across several hypergraph ensembles, and we characterize their ordering dynamics through simulations of both higher-order and reduced dynamics. For a linear social impact function (hypergraph-linear voter model) the weights of the projected network are static, allowing us to develop a pair approximation that describes with accuracy the time evolution of macroscopic observables, which turn out to be independent of those weights. The macroscopic dynamics is thus equivalent to that of the standard voter model on the unweighted projected network. For a power-law social impact function (hypergraph-nonlinear voter model) the weights of the projected network depend on the instantaneous system configuration. Nevertheless, the nonlinear voter model on the unweighted projected network still reproduces the main macroscopic trends for well connected hypergraphs."

    "abstract": "Detecting and counting copies of permutation patterns are fundamental algorithmic problems, with applications in the analysis of rankings, nonparametric statistics, and property testing tasks such as independence and quasirandomness testing. From an algorithmic perspective, there is a sharp difference in complexity between detecting and counting the copies of a given length-$k$ pattern in a length-$n$ permutation. The former admits a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^2)} \\cdot n$ time algorithm (Guillemot and Marx, 2014) while the latter cannot be solved in time $f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails (Berendsohn, Kozma, and Marx, 2021). In fact already for patterns of length 4, exact counting is unlikely to admit near-linear time algorithms under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions (Dudek and Gawrychowski, 2020). Recently, Ben-Eliezer, Mitrović and Sristava (2026) showed that for patterns of length up to 5, a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation of the pattern count can be computed in near-linear time, yielding a separation between exact and approximate counting for small patterns, and conjectured that approximate counting is asymptotically easier than exact counting in general. We strongly refute their conjecture by showing that, under ETH, no algorithm running in time $f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ can approximate the number of copies of a length-$k$ pattern within a multiplicative factor $n^{(1/2-\\varepsilon)k}$. The lower bound on runtime matches the conditional lower bound for exact pattern counting, and the obtained bound on the multiplicative error factor is essentially tight, as an $n^{k/2}$-approximation can be computed in $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\\cdot n$ time using an algorithm for pattern detection."

Key contributions include a high-level system design enabling real-time diagram updates, specialized prompt engineering and error-checking to ensure well-formed XML outputs. We demonstrate a working prototype capable of generating accurate diagrams (such as network architectures and flowcharts) from natural language or code, and even replicating diagrams from images.

However, simulating materials with atomic-level resolution on a macroscopic scale is infeasible on current classical hardware, even when using the simplest elastic network models (ENMs) that represent molecular vibrations as a network of coupled oscillators. To address this issue, we introduce Quantum Elastic Network Models (QENMs) and utilize the quantum algorithm of Babbush et al. (PRX, 2023), which offers an exponential advantage when simulating systems of coupled oscillators under some specific conditions and assumptions. Here, we demonstrate how our method enables the efficient simulation of planar materials. As an example, we apply our algorithm to the task of simulating a 2D graphene sheet. We analyze the exact complexity for initial-state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and measurement of this material, and provide two real-world applications: heat transfer and the out-of-plane rippling effect. We estimate that an atomistic simulation of a graphene sheet on the centimeter scale, classically requiring hundreds of petabytes of memory and prohibitive runtimes, could be encoded and simulated with as few as $\\sim 160$ logical qubits."

We propose roofs, a Python package available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/compo/roofs, designed to help researchers in the choice of FS method adapted to their problem. Roofs benchmarks multiple FS methods on the user's data and generates reports that summarize a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including downstream predictive performance estimated using optimism correction, stability, reliability of individual features, and true positive and false positive rates assessed on semi-synthetic data with a simulated outcome. We demonstrate the utility of roofs on data from the PIONeeR clinical trial, aimed at identifying predictors of resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy in lung cancer. The PIONeeR dataset contained 374 multi-source blood and tumor biomarkers from 435 patients. A reduced subset of 214 features was obtained through iterative variance inflation factor pre-filtering. Of the 34 FS methods gathered in roofs, we evaluated 23 in combination with 11 classifiers (253 models in total) and identified a filter based on the union of Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate-adjusted p-values from t-test and logistic regression as the optimal approach, outperforming other methods including the widely used LASSO. We conclude that comprehensive benchmarking with roofs has the potential to improve the robustness and reproducibility of FS discoveries and increase the translational value of clinical models."

    "abstract": "The scarcity of predicted magnetic topological materials (MTMs) by magnetic space group (MSG) hinders further exploration towards realistic device applications. Here, we propose a new scheme combining spin space groups (SSGs)--approximate symmetry groups neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC)--and MSGs to diagnose topology in collinear magnetic materials based on symmetry-indicator theory, enabling a systematic classification of the electronic topology across 484 experimentally synthesized collinear magnets from the MAGNDATA database. This new scheme exploits a symmetry-hierarchy due to SOC induced symmetry-breaking, so that nontrivial band topology can be revealed by SSG, that is yet invisible by the conventional MSG-based method, as exemplified by real triple points in ferromagnetic CaCu$_3$Fe$_2$Sb$_2$O$_{12}$, Dirac nodal lines at generic $k$-points in antiferromagnetic FePSe$_3$ and Weyl nodal lines in altermagnetic Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$. Notably, FePSe$_3$ is topologically trivial under MSG but hosts Dirac nodal lines within the SSG framework. Upon including SOC, these nodal lines are gapped and generate a sizable anomalous Hall conductivity. Despite a vanishing bulk net magnetism, FePSe$_3$ can host topologically protected surface states with large non-relativistic band spin-splitting. Moreover, topology in MTMs is tunable by rotating the magnetic moment direction once SOC is included, as exemplified in Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$.The interplay of topology with non-relativistic and SOC-induced control of properties via magnetic moment reorientation in the predicted MTMs is worthy of further studies in future."

    "abstract": "Recent diffusion-based image editing methods commonly rely on text or high-level instructions to guide the generation process, offering intuitive but coarse control. In contrast, we focus on explicit, prompt-free editing, where the user directly specifies the modification by cropping and pasting an object or sub-object into a chosen location within an image. This operation affords precise spatial and visual control, yet it introduces a fundamental challenge: preserving the identity of the pasted object while harmonizing it with its new context. We observe that attention maps in diffusion-based editing models inherently govern whether image regions are preserved or adapted for coherence. Building on this insight, we introduce LooseRoPE, a saliency-guided modulation of rotational positional encoding (RoPE) that loosens the positional constraints to continuously control the attention field of view. By relaxing RoPE in this manner, our method smoothly steers the model's focus between faithful preservation of the input image and coherent harmonization of the inserted object, enabling a balanced trade-off between identity retention and contextual blending. Our approach provides a flexible and intuitive framework for image editing, achieving seamless compositional results without textual descriptions or complex user input."

The key enabler is the partitioning of the domain based on a nonlinear manifold learning approach, in which spatial points are clustered based on the similarity of their dynamics, as observed in their compact embedding in manifold coordinates. The method receives as input time-resolved flow fields. From these, the spatial manifold is computed through isometric mapping applied to the vorticity time histories at each spatial location. An unsupervised clustering method, applied in the manifold space, partitions the full flow domain into subdomains. The dynamics of each subdomain are then described with cluster-based modeling. The method is demonstrated on two flow-field datasets obtained with a direct numerical simulation of a fluidic pinball under periodic forcing and with two-dimensional particle image velocimetry measurements of a transitional jet flow. The spatial manifold-based flow partitioning identifies regions with similar dynamics in an automated way. For both cases, ST-CNM identifies local dynamics that are not captured by a global approach. In particular, vortex shedding and vortex pairing dynamics are isolated in the jet flow experiment. The proposed fully automated domain partitioning method will benefit the structural description of controlled flows and unveil the actuation mechanisms at play."

The amount of transferred spin differs between the singlet and triplet $m=0$ states due to quantum interference. The difference is such that the independent-electron approximation remains valid for spin transfer when injected spin currents are completely incoherent. However, in partially coherent systems, like superconductor/ferromagnet junctions, coherent spin-singlet currents can directly convert into equal-spin triplet currents in generic ferromagnets, without requiring magnetic inhomogeniety or spin-orbit coupling."

This has created an unexpected and unaddressed security issue where naive integration of those defenses can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. This occurs when one defense changes an aspect of a microarchitecture that is crucial for the security of another defense. We refer to this problem as a microarchitectural defense assumption violation} (MDAV). We propose a two-step methodology to screen for potential MDAVs in the early-stage of integration. The first step is to design and integrate a composed model, guided by bounded model checking of security properties. The second step is to implement the model concretely on a simulator and to evaluate with simulated attacks. As a contribution supporting the first step, we propose an event-based modeling framework, called Maestro, for testing and evaluating microarchitectural models with integrated defenses. In our evaluation, Maestro reveals MDAVs (8), supports compact expression (~15x Alloy LoC ratio), enables semantic composability and eliminates performance degradations (>100x). As a contribution supporting the second step, we use an event-based simulator (GEM5) for investigating integrated microarchitectural defenses. We show that a covert channel attack is possible on a naively integrated implementation of some state-of-the-art defenses, and a repaired implementation using our integration methodology is resilient to the attack."

    "abstract": "We study a spatial predator-prey model in which prey can enter a protection zone (refuge) inaccessible to predators, while predators exhibit directed movement toward prey-rich regions. The directed movement is modeled by a far-sighted population flux motivated by classical movement rules, in contrast to the more commonly analyzed near-sighted chemotaxis-type mechanisms. We first establish local-in-time well-posedness for the corresponding nonstationary problem under Neumann boundary conditions, despite the discontinuity induced by the refuge interface. We then investigate the stationary problem, focusing on how the coexistence states emerge and organize globally in parameter space. In particular, we identify the bifurcation threshold for positive steady states from semitrivial predator-only equilibria, and describe the global continuation of the resulting branches. Our analysis reveals that strong directed movement can induce turning-point structures and multiplicity of coexistence steady states, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between spatial protection and predator movement behavior."

The PINN accurately reproduces the self-similar growth law and concentration profiles for a wide range of initial droplet radii, demonstrating convergence toward the asymptotic diffusive regime. The proposed approach provides a flexible and computationally efficient framework for solving moving-boundary diffusion problems and can be readily extended to include additional physical effects."

In this paper, we establish rigorous refinements of this inequality specifically for twice-differentiable functions with bounded Hessians. By utilizing Taylor expansions with integral remainders, we tried to bridge the gap between classical variance-based bounds and higher-precision estimates. We also discover explicit error terms governed by Gruss-type inequalities, allowing for the incorporation of skewness and kurtosis into the bound. Using these new theoretical tools, we improve upon existing estimates for the Shannon entropy of continuous distributions and the ergodic capacity of Rayleigh fading channels, demonstrating the practical efficacy of our refinements."

Using this technique, we directly probe a laser-excited phase transition in the prototypical material vanadium dioxide (VO2), recording its spatiotemporal propagation. This direct imaging capability reveals the dynamics of the structural phase transition and connects it to the resulting strain formation on picosecond timescales. This correlation reveals how atomic-scale symmetry breaking inherently generates lattice distortions, which then propagate to govern macroscopic property changes. Our findings provide new insights into the coupling between electronic, structural, and mechanical responses in correlated oxides under non-equilibrium conditions."

While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization."

We derive a minimal algorithm from first principles: cycle detection via per-position state tracking and $O(1)$-per-LR-cycle communication from descendant to ancestor recursion frames, and fixed-point search via iterative expansion. For error recovery, we derived a set of four axioms and twelve constraints that must be imposed upon an optimal error recovery design to ensure completeness, correctness, optimality of performance, and intuitiveness of behavior. We utilized a constraint satisfaction mechanism to search the space of all possibilities, arriving at a provably optimal and robust error recovery strategy that maintains perfect performance linearity."

    "abstract": "Liquid metals are central to energy-storage and nuclear technologies, yet quantitative knowledge of their thermophysical properties remains limited. While atomistic simulations offer a route to computing liquid properties directly from atomic motion, the most accurate approach, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), is computationally costly and restricted to short time and length scales. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLPs) offer AIMD accuracy at far lower cost, but their application to liquids is limited by training datasets that inadequately sample atomic configurations, leading to unphysical force predictions and unstable trajectories. Here we introduce a physically motivated dataset-engineering strategy that constructs liquidlike training data synthetically rather than relying on AIMD configurations. The method exploits the established icosahedral short-range order of metallic liquids, twelvefold, near-close-packed local coordination, and generates \"synthetic-liquid\" structures by systematic perturbation of crystalline references. MLPs trained on these datasets close the sampling gaps that lead to unphysical predictions, remain numerically stable across temperatures, and reproduce experimental liquid densities, diffusivities, and melting temperatures for multiple elemental metals. The framework links atomic-scale sampling to long-term MD stability and provides a practical route to predictive modeling of liquid-phase thermophysical behavior beyond the limits of direct AIMD."

This offers a new approach to realizing out-of-equilibrium states at given temperatures. We show two applications of this platform: temporally-correlated dichromatic emission and Liouvillian exception point protected quantum synchronization at finite temperatures, both of which are challenging to achieve with conventional thermal reservoirs."

The YOLOv10 object detector is chosen as a representative, and adversarial patches are used in an evasion attack manner. Our results indicate that higher-order adversarial patches are not only affecting the object detector directly trained on but rather provide a stronger generalization capacity compared to lower-order adversarial patches.

Though certainly a black hole (BH) in the cases of the most massive BNSs, X-ray lightcurves from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows suggest a neutron star (NS) as a viable candidate for both the merger remnant as well as the central engine of these transients. When jointly observed with gravitational waves (GWs), X-ray lightcurves from BNS merger events could provide critical constraints on the remnant's nature. We aim to assess the current and future capabilities to detect a NS remnant through X-ray observations following GW detections. To this end, we simulate GW signals from BNS mergers and the subsequent X-ray emission from newborn millisecond magnetars. The GW detectability is modeled for both current and next-generation interferometers, while the X-ray emission is reproduced using a dedicated numerical code that models magnetar spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical-relativity simulations. In our simulations, 2% - 16% of BNS mergers form millisecond magnetars. Among these, up to 70% could be detectable, amounting to up to 1 millisecond magnetar detection per year with SVOM/MXT-like instruments during the LIGO Virgo KAGRA LIGO India (LVKI) O5 run, with optimal detectability occurring about 2 hours post-merger. For next-generation GW interferometers, this rate could increase by up to three orders of magnitude, with peak detectability 3 to 4 hours post-merger. We also explore how the magnetar's magnetic field strength and observer viewing angle affect detectability and discuss optimized observational strategies. Although more likely with upcoming GW interferometers, detecting the spin-down emission of a millisecond magnetar may already be within reach, warranting sustained theoretical and observational efforts given the profound implications for mergers, GRBs, and NS physics of a single detection."

We show that dust extinction systematically overestimates scale heights at shorter rest-frame wavelengths, and therefore adopt a fixed rest-frame wavelength of 1 $μ$m. After further correcting for projection-induced bias using a new accurate method, we find that the median disk scale height increases from $0.56\\pm0.03$ kpc at $z=3.25$ to $0.84\\pm0.04$ kpc at $z=1.25$, and subsequently decreases to $0.67\\pm0.06$ kpc at $z=0.25$. The disk length-to-height ratio remains constant at $2.7\\pm0.2$ for $z>1.5$, but rises to $4.0\\pm0.4$ at $z=0.25$. These results imply that the high-redshift progenitors of present-day thick disks were of intermediate thickness, neither thin nor thick, yet dynamically hot and dense. The observed radial variation of scale height is consistent with the artificial flaring expected from observational effects, disfavoring minor mergers as the primary mechanism of disk thickening. Instead, we suggest that the high-redshift intermediate-thickness disks were single-component systems that increased their vertical scale height through decreasing surface mass density and/or violent gravitational instabilities, eventually producing thick disks. Thin-disk growth begins at $z\\approx2$ and dominates at $z\\lesssim1$, yielding a vertically more compact system with decreasing scale heights from $z\\approx1$ to $0$. The inferred thin-disk mass fraction increases from $0.1\\pm0.03$ at $z=1$ to $0.6\\pm0.1$ at $z=0$.

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of the pancreas and its lesions in CT scans is crucial for the precise diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, it remains a highly challenging task due to several factors such as low tissue contrast with surrounding organs, blurry anatomical boundaries, irregular organ shapes, and the small size of lesions. To tackle these issues, we propose DB-MSMUNet (Dual-Branch Multi-scale Mamba UNet), a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed specifically for robust pancreatic segmentation. The encoder is constructed using a Multi-scale Mamba Module (MSMM), which combines deformable convolutions and multi-scale state space modeling to enhance both global context modeling and local deformation adaptation. The network employs a dual-decoder design: the edge decoder introduces an Edge Enhancement Path (EEP) to explicitly capture boundary cues and refine fuzzy contours, while the area decoder incorporates a Multi-layer Decoder (MLD) to preserve fine-grained details and accurately reconstruct small lesions by leveraging multi-scale deep semantic features. Furthermore, Auxiliary Deep Supervision (ADS) heads are added at multiple scales to both decoders, providing more accurate gradient feedback and further enhancing the discriminative capability of multi-scale features. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets: the NIH Pancreas dataset, the MSD dataset, and a clinical pancreatic tumor dataset provided by collaborating hospitals. DB-MSMUNet achieves Dice Similarity Coefficients of 89.47%, 87.59%, and 89.02%, respectively, outperforming most existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, edge preservation, and robustness across different datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method for real-world pancreatic CT segmentation tasks."

Traditional quantifier instantiation methods struggle because they lack semantic understanding of UF constraints, forcing them to search through unbounded solution spaces with limited guidance. We present AquaForte, a framework that leverages Large Language Models to provide semantic guidance for UF instantiation by generating instantiated candidates for function definitions that satisfy the constraints, thereby significantly reducing the search space and complexity for solvers. Our approach preprocesses formulas through constraint separation, uses structured prompts to extract mathematical reasoning from LLMs, and integrates the results with traditional SMT algorithms through adaptive instantiation. AquaForte maintains soundness through systematic validation: LLM-guided instantiations yielding SAT solve the original problem, while UNSAT results generate exclusion clauses for iterative refinement. Completeness is preserved by fallback to traditional solvers augmented with learned constraints. Experimental evaluation on SMT-COMP benchmarks demonstrates that AquaForte solves numerous instances where state-of-the-art solvers like Z3 and CVC5 timeout, with particular effectiveness on satisfiable formulas. Our work shows that LLMs can provide valuable mathematical intuition for symbolic reasoning, establishing a new paradigm for SMT constraint solving."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a critical stage in modern language model development, playing a key role in improving alignment and reasoning ability. However, several phenomena remain poorly understood, including the reduction in output diversity. To gain a broader understanding of RL post-training, we analyze the learning dynamics of RL post-training from a perspective that has been studied in supervised learning but remains underexplored in RL. We adopt an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decompose the NTK into two components to characterize how RL updates propagate across training samples. Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis by demonstrating increased model confidence and accelerated optimization under CF-RL. Additional analysis shows that the mechanism underlying CF-RL differs from that of linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning. Overall, our study formalizes the learning dynamics of RL post-training and motivates further analysis and improvement."

Defending against PI attacks faces two major issues: malicious instructions can be injected through diverse vectors, and injected instructions often lack clear semantic boundaries from the surrounding context, making them difficult to identify. To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context. We evaluate InstruCoT across three critical dimensions: Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output. Experimental results across four LLMs demonstrate that InstruCoT significantly outperforms baselines in all dimensions while maintaining utility performance without degradation"

    "abstract": "This study proposes FlexiVoice, a text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system capable of flexible style control with zero-shot voice cloning. The speaking style is controlled by a natural-language instruction and the voice timbre is provided by a speech reference in zero-shot manner. FlexiVoice is built with an LLM core, which takes text as input, and also takes an optional natural language instruction and an optional speech reference to control style and timbre, respectively. FlexiVoice is equipped with a novel Progressive Post-Training (PPT) scheme that progressively unlocks accurate and flexible controllability. In particular, it first employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enable FlexiVoice to accurately follow both natural language instruction and speech reference simultaneously. It then uses a multi-objective Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to disentangle style instruction, reference timbre, and textual content. Finally, it adapts instruction GRPO for more advanced instruction following. Experimental results show that FlexiVoice surpasses competing baselines and demonstrates strong capability in decoupling control factors. Human evaluations further confirm its naturalness, controllability, and robustness. Audio samples are available at https://flexi-voice.github.io."

By virtue of the filtering technique, the Riccati equation approach, the method of orthogonal decomposition, and the completion-of-squares method, we obtain the closed-loop saddle point of the zero-sum game via the optimal feedback control-strategy pair. Subsequently, we prove that the corresponding outcome of the closed-loop saddle point satisfies the $H_\\infty$ performance criterion.

    "abstract": "For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, denote by $a(G)$ the number of vertices in the largest induced forest in $G$. The Albertson-Berman conjecture, which is open since 1979, states that $a(G) \\geq \\frac{n}{2}$ for all simple planar graphs $G$. We show that the version of this problem for multigraphs (allowing parallel edges) is easily reduced to the problem about the independence number of simple planar graphs. Specifically, we prove that $a(M) \\geq \\frac{n}{4}$ for all planar multigraphs $M$ and that this lower bound is tight. Then, we study the case when the number of pairs of vertices with parallel edges, which we denote by $k$, is small. In particular, we prove the lower bound $a(M) \\geq \\frac{2}{5}n-\\frac{k}{10}$ and that the Albertson-Berman conjecture for simple planar graphs, assuming that it holds, would imply the lower bound $a(M) \\geq \\frac{n-k}{2}$ for planar multigraphs, which would be better than the general lower bound when $k$ is small. Finally, we study the variant of the problem where the plane multigraphs are prohibited from having $2$-faces, which is the main non-trivial problem that we introduce in this article. For that variant without $2$-faces, we prove the lower bound $a(M) \\geq \\frac{3}{10}n+\\frac{7}{30}$ and give a construction of an infinite sequence of multigraphs with $a(M)=\\frac{3}{7}n+\\frac{4}{7}$."

    "abstract": "Nonlocality can be studied through different approaches, such as Bell's inequalities, and it can be found in numerous quantum states, including GHZ states or graph states. Hardy's paradox, or Hardy-type nonlocality, provides a way to investigate nonlocality for entangled states of particles without using inequalities. Previous studies of Hardy's nonlocality have mostly focused on the fully entangled systems, while other entanglement configurations remain less explored. In this work, the system under investigation consists of four particles arranged in a cyclic entanglement configuration, where each particle forms entangled pairs with two neighbors, while non-neighboring particles remain unentangled. We found that this entanglement structure offers a larger set of conditions that lead to the contradiction with the LHV model, compared to the fully entangled systems. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of multiple excluded states and correlations, in which the measurement result of a particle only influences the result of its paired partners. We implement quantum circuits compatible with the cyclic entanglement structure, and through simulation, the correlation patterns and the states of interest are identified. We further execute the proposed circuits on IBM Brisbane, a practical backend; however, the results show considerable deviations from the simulation counterparts."

In this paper, we show that if additionally we also use a ray shooting data structure, we can also find a minimum dominating set in an RDV graph $O(n\\log n)$ time (presuming a linear-sized representation of the graph is given). The same idea can also be used for a new proof to find a minimum dominating set in an interval graph in $O(n)$ time."

First, we extract Euclidean features using CLIP and map them to hyperbolic space. Second, we design a dynamic-supervision entailment modeling mechanism that transforms discrete entailment logic into continuous geometric structure supervision. Finally, we propose an adaptive modulation regressor that utilizes hyperbolic geometric features to generate sample-level modulation parameters, adaptively calibrating Euclidean cosine similarity to predict the final score. HyperAlign achieves highly competitive performance on both single database evaluation and cross-database generalization tasks, fully validating the effectiveness of hyperbolic geometric modeling for image-text alignment assessment."

    "abstract": "Polydispersity is a universal feature of synthetic polymers and biological molecules in the cytoplasm. However, its quantitative impact on collective behavior remains poorly understood because conventional metrics, such as the polydispersity index, fail to capture broad, non-Gaussian size distributions. Here, we develop an experimental platform in which polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions are engineered to follow tunable power-law molecular-weight distributions spanning an extensive range, from $M = 1$ kg/mol to $10^{4}$ kg/mol. By systematically varying the $M$ distribution exponent $a$, we identify a robust regime ($1 < a \\lesssim 2.5$) in which the viscosity scaling exponent in the entangled regime, the overlap concentration $c^{\\ast}$, and the entanglement concentration ${c_{\\mathrm{e}}}$ all exhibit pronounced maxima that exceed monodisperse limits. This amplification minimizes as the upper cutoff $M_{\\max}$ is reduced, with the system approaching monodisperse behavior. The enhanced rheology arises from a competition between long-chain-dominated entanglement and short-chain-mediated void filling, demonstrating that the whole shape of the molecular-weight distribution plays a decisive role. Consequently, these collective behaviors cannot be reproduced by simply tuning the average molecular weight. Together, our results establish the power-law exponent $a$ as a quantitative control parameter that links polymer entanglement, soft packing, and molecular crowding in highly polydisperse systems."

To address these issues, we propose a high uncertainty region-guided multi-architecture collaborative learning (HUR-MACL) model for multi-organ segmentation in the head and neck. This model adaptively identifies high uncertainty regions using a convolutional neural network, and for these regions, Vision Mamba as well as Deformable CNN are utilized to jointly improve their segmentation accuracy. Additionally, a heterogeneous feature distillation loss was proposed to promote collaborative learning between the two architectures in high uncertainty regions to further enhance performance. Our method achieves SOTA results on two public datasets and one private dataset."

This survey systematizes the emerging landscape of agent-blockchain interoperability through a systematic literature review, identifying 317 relevant works from an initial pool of over 3000 records.

FeedEval employs dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on datasets curated in this study to assess multiple feedback candidates and select high-quality feedback for downstream use. Experiments on the ASAP++ benchmark show that FeedEval closely aligns with human expert judgments and that essay scoring models trained with FeedEval-filtered high-quality feedback achieve superior scoring performance.

While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \\textbf{planning attacks}, \\textbf{memory attacks}, and \\textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \\textbf{Agent QA}, \\textbf{Agent Code}, \\textbf{Agent Web}, and \\textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \\textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\\% of planning attacks, 77.97\\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats.

In the case of deuterium, the ΔJ=0 mode splits upon entering phase II suggesting a very complex molecular environment of the broken symmetry phase (BSP). In the fluid state and phases I and II the frequencies (energies) of the ΔJ=0 transition for H2 and D2 do not scale either as rotational (by factor of 2) nor vibrational (by square 2) modes and appear to be completely isotope independent. This independence on mass marks this transition as unique and a fundamentally different type of excitation from the commonly considered harmonic oscillator and quantum rotor."

The resulting regression-based terramechanics model accurately reproduced steady-state and dynamic slip, as well as sinkage behavior, on flat terrain and slopes up to 20 degrees, with validation against field test results. Additionally, improvements were made to enhance the realism of terrain deformation and wheel trace visualization. This method supports real-time applications that require physically plausible terrain response alongside high visual fidelity."

    "abstract": "Human centric critical systems are increasingly involving artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, gesture based human computer interaction systems, and autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate for a long term potentially for a lifetime in many scenarios such as closed loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoting systems for stroke diagnosis, and rehabilitation. Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of an AI enabled human centric control system and discuss their limitations for testing the system for long term use in practice. We then propose personalized model based solutions for potentially eliminating such limitations."

    "abstract": "Using quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, a secret key is created between two distant users (transmitter and receiver) at a particular key rate. Quantum technology can facilitate secure communication for cryptographic applications, combining QKD with one-time-pad (OTP) encryption. In order to ensure the continuous operation of QKD in real-world networks, efforts have been concentrated on optimizing the use of components and effective QKD protocols to improve secret key rates and increase the transmission between multiple users. Generally, in experimental implementations, the secret key rates are limited by single-photon detectors, which are used at the receivers of QKD and create a bottleneck due to their limited detection rates (detectors with low detection efficiency and high detector dead-time). We experimentally show that secret key rates can be increased by combining the time-bin information of two such detectors on the data line of the receiver for the coherent-one-way (COW) QKD protocol with a minimal increase in quantum bit error rate (QBER, the proportion of erroneous bits). Further, we implement a point-to-multipoint COW QKD protocol, introducing an additional receiver module. The three users (one transmitter and two receivers) share the secret key in post-processing, relying on OTP encryption. Typically, the dual-receiver extension can improve the combined secret key rates of the system; however, one has to optimise the experimental parameters to achieve this within security margins. These methods are general and can be applied to any implementation of the COW protocol."

Such modular robots add flexibility and versatility for space missions where resources are constrained. Each module is driven by a common actuator characterized by a high torque-to-speed ratio, supporting both precise control and dynamic motion when required. This unified actuator design simplifies development and maintenance across the different module types. The paper describes the hardware implementation, the mechanical design of the modules, and the overall software architecture used to control and coordinate them. Additionally, we evaluate the control performance of the actuator under various load conditions to characterize its suitability for modular robot applications. To demonstrate the adaptability of the system, we introduce nine functional configurations assembled from the same set of modules: 4DOF-limb, 8DOF-limb, vehicle, dragon, minimal, quadruped, cargo, cargo-minimal, and bike. These configurations reflect different locomotion strategies and task-specific behaviors, offering a practical foundation for further research in reconfigurable robotic systems."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central component of large language model (LLM) post-training. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medical Question Answering (QA), yet they remain prone to hallucinations and ungrounded reasoning, limiting their reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by incorporating external knowledge, conventional single-shot retrieval often fails to resolve complex biomedical queries requiring multi-step inference. To address this, we propose Self-MedRAG, a self-reflective hybrid framework designed to mimic the iterative hypothesis-verification process of clinical reasoning. Self-MedRAG integrates a hybrid retrieval strategy, combining sparse (BM25) and dense (Contriever) retrievers via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to maximize evidence coverage. It employs a generator to produce answers with supporting rationales, which are then assessed by a lightweight self-reflection module using Natural Language Inference (NLI) or LLM-based verification. If the rationale lacks sufficient evidentiary support, the system autonomously reformulates the query and iterates to refine the context. We evaluated Self-MedRAG on the MedQA and PubMedQA benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our hybrid retrieval approach significantly outperforms single-retriever baselines. Furthermore, the inclusion of the self-reflective loop yielded substantial gains, increasing accuracy on MedQA from 80.00% to 83.33% and on PubMedQA from 69.10% to 79.82%. These findings confirm that integrating hybrid retrieval with iterative, evidence-based self-reflection effectively reduces unsupported claims and enhances the clinical reliability of LLM-based systems."

In this paper, we propose GRACE, a reinforcement-learning framework that simultaneously mitigates both types of flaws. GRACE employs a data construction method that utilizes heterogeneous retrievers to generate diverse training samples without manual annotation. A multi-stage gated reward function is then employed to train the model to assess evidence sufficiency, extract key supporting evidence, and provide answers or explicitly abstain. Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate that GRACE achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and strikes a favorable balance between accurate response and rejection, while requiring only 10% of the annotation costs of prior methods.

    "abstract": "Multiagent reinforcement learning, as a prominent intelligent paradigm, enables collaborative decision-making within complex systems. However, existing approaches often rely on explicit action exchange between agents to evaluate action value functions, which is frequently impractical in real-world engineering environments due to communication constraints, latency, energy consumption, and reliability requirements. From an artificial intelligence perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced multiagent reinforcement learning framework that employs action estimation neural networks to infer agent behaviors. By integrating a lightweight action estimation module, each agent infers neighboring agents' behaviors using only locally observable information, enabling collaborative policy learning without explicit action sharing. This approach is fully compatible with standard TD3 algorithms and scalable to larger multiagent systems. At the engineering application level, this framework has been implemented and validated in dual-arm robotic manipulation tasks: two robotic arms collaboratively lift objects. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the robustness and deployment feasibility of real-world robotic systems while reducing dependence on information infrastructure. Overall, this research advances the development of decentralized multiagent artificial intelligence systems while enabling AI to operate effectively in dynamic, information-constrained real-world environments."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of wireless communications, specific emitter identification (SEI) is significant for communication security. However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost."

    "abstract": "In digital learning systems, gaming the system refers to occasions when students attempt to succeed in an educational task by systematically taking advantage of system features rather than engaging meaningfully with the content. Often viewed as a form of behavioral disengagement, gaming the system is negatively associated with short- and long-term learning outcomes. However, little research has explored this phenomenon beyond its behavioral representation, leaving questions such as whether students are cognitively disengaged or whether they engage in different self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies when gaming largely unanswered. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to examine students' cognitive engagement and SRL processes during gaming versus non-gaming periods, using utterance length and SRL codes inferred from think-aloud protocols collected while students interacted with an intelligent tutoring system for chemistry. We found that gaming does not simply reflect a lack of cognitive effort; during gaming, students often produced longer utterances, were more likely to engage in processing information and realizing errors, but less likely to engage in planning, and exhibited reactive rather than proactive self-regulatory strategies. These findings provide empirical evidence supporting the interpretation that gaming may represent a maladaptive form of SRL. With this understanding, future work can address gaming and its negative impacts by designing systems that target maladaptive self-regulation to promote better learning."

We develop a formal information-theoretic framework for quantifying how much predictive structure fine-tuning extracts from the train dataset and writes into a model's parameters. Our central quantity, Excess Description Length (EDL), is defined via prequential coding and measures the gap between the bits required to encode training labels sequentially using an evolving model (trained online) and the residual encoding cost under the final trained model. We establish that EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in the infinite-data limit, and provides bounds on expected generalization gain. Through a series of toy models, we clarify common confusions about information in learning: why random labels yield EDL near zero, how a single example can eliminate many bits of uncertainty about the underlying rule(s) that describe the data distribution, why structure learned on rare inputs contributes proportionally little to expected generalization, and how format learning creates early transients distinct from capability acquisition. This framework provides rigorous foundations for the empirical observation that capability elicitation and teaching exhibit qualitatively distinct scaling signatures."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent agents that reason, plan, and interact with their environments. To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models."

This nanoscale operability highlights the exceptional potential of PBAs for high-scalable and low-dimension memristor-based devices integration. Due to their modular composition, PBAs constitute a chemically rich, earth-abundant materials platform whose electronic and ionic properties can be precisely tuned for specific device functions. K-ion intercalation PBA-based memristor devices, with their singlestep, aqueous, and room-temperature fabrication, enable low-cost, large-scale processing compatible with CMOS, without any additional post-fabrication processing. Our findings establish PBAs as a new class of intercalation memristors with scalable nanoscale switching and exceptional materials versatility, toward highly integrated neuromorphic and non-volatile memory technologies. This work provides the first demonstration of intercalation-driven resistive switching under ultrafast voltage sweeps, with PW operating up to 200 V/s and PB up to 50 V/s.

The near-surface velocity structure of the Vado di Corno seismogenic fault zone was quantified at different length scales, from laboratory measurements of ultrasonic velocities (few centimeters rock samples, 1 MHz source) to high-resolution first-arrival seismic tomography (spatial resolution to a few meters). The fault zone juxtaposed structural units with contrasting ultrasonic velocities. The fault core cataclastic units were slower compared to damage zone units. A negative correlation between ultrasonic velocity and porosity was observed, with dispersion in fault core units related to varying degree of textural maturity and pore space sealing by calcite. Low-velocity outliers in the damage zone were instead linked to microfracture networks with local cataclasis and partial calcite sealing. P-wave high-resolution seismic tomography imaged distinct fault-bounded rock bodies, matching the geometry and size of field-mapped structural units. At this length scale, relatively fast fault core units and low-strain damage zones contrasted with a very slow intensely fractured high-strain damage zone. The discrepancy between higher ultrasonic velocities and lower tomography-derived ones was reconciled through an effective medium approach considering the effect of meso-scale fractures in each unit. This revealed a heterogeneous fault zone velocity structure with different scaling among structural units. Lastly, the persistence of a thick compliant high-strain damage zone at shallow depth may significantly affect fault zone mechanics and the distribution of near-surface deformations."

    "abstract": "Integrating image generation and understanding into a single framework has become a pivotal goal in the multimodal domain. However, how understanding can effectively assist generation has not been fully explored. Unlike previous works that focus on leveraging reasoning abilities and world knowledge from understanding models, this paper introduces a novel perspective: leveraging understanding to enhance the fidelity and detail richness of generated images. To this end, we propose Forge-and-Quench, a new unified framework that puts this principle into practice. In the generation process of our framework, an MLLM first reasons over the entire conversational context, including text instructions, to produce an enhanced text instruction. This refined instruction is then mapped to a virtual visual representation, termed the Bridge Feature, via a novel Bridge Adapter. This feature acts as a crucial link, forging insights from the understanding model to quench and refine the generation process. It is subsequently injected into the T2I backbone as a visual guidance signal, alongside the enhanced text instruction that replaces the original input. To validate this paradigm, we conduct comprehensive studies on the design of the Bridge Feature and Bridge Adapter. Our framework demonstrates exceptional extensibility and flexibility, enabling efficient migration across different MLLM and T2I models with significant savings in training overhead, all without compromising the MLLM's inherent multimodal understanding capabilities. Experiments show that Forge-and-Quench significantly improves image fidelity and detail across multiple models, while also maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application.

    "abstract": "Rapid e-commerce growth has pushed last-mile delivery networks to their limits, where small routing gains translate into lower costs, faster service, and fewer emissions. Classical heuristics struggle to adapt when travel times are highly asymmetric (e.g., one-way streets, congestion). A deep learning-based approach to the last-mile routing problem is presented to generate geographical zones composed of stop sequences to minimize last-mile delivery times. The presented approach is an encoder-decoder architecture. Each route is represented as a complete directed graph whose nodes are stops and whose edge weights are asymmetric travel times. A Graph Neural Network encoder produces node embeddings that captures the spatial relationships between stops. A Pointer Network decoder then takes the embeddings and the route's start node to sequentially select the next stops, assigning a probability to each unvisited node as the next destination. Cells of a Discrete Global Grid System which contain route stops in the training data are obtained and clustered to generate geographical zones of similar size in which the process of training and inference are divided. Subsequently, a different instance of the model is trained per zone only considering the stops of the training routes which are included in that zone. This approach is evaluated using the Los Angeles routes from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Challenge. Results from general and zone-based training are compared, showing a reduction in the average predicted route length in the zone-based training compared to the general training. The performance improvement of the zone-based approach becomes more pronounced as the number of stops per route increases."

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving not only superior answer accuracy but also significantly more stable training dynamics.\\footnote{The source code for M-ASK is available at https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK.}"

    "abstract": "High-dimensional dynamical systems of interacting degrees of freedom are ubiquitous in the study of complex systems. When the directed interactions are totally uncorrelated, sufficiently strong and non-linear, many of these systems exhibit a chaotic attractor characterized by a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). On the contrary, when the interactions are completely symmetric, the dynamics takes the form of a gradient descent on a carefully defined cost function, and it exhibits slow dynamics and aging. In this work, we consider the intermediate case in which the interactions are partially symmetric, with a parameter α tuning the degree of non-reciprocity. We show that for any value of α for which the corresponding system has non-reciprocal interactions, the dynamics lands on a chaotic attractor. Correspondingly, the MLE is a non-monotonous function of the degree of non-reciprocity. This implies that conservative forcing deriving from the gradient field of a rough energy landscape can make the system more chaotic."

    "abstract": "Current techniques for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs) rely either on costly human supervision or on external verifiers to boost performance on tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, as LLMs improve their problem-solving, any further improvement will potentially require high-quality solutions to difficult problems that are not available to humans. As a result, learning from unlabeled data is becoming increasingly attractive in the research community. Existing methods extract learning signal from a model's consistency, either by majority voting or by converting the model's internal confidence into reward. Although internal consistency metric such as entropy or self-certainty require no human intervention, as we show in this work, these are unreliable signals for large-scale and long-term training. To address the unreliability, we propose PRISM, a unified training framework that uses a Process Reward Model (PRM) to guide learning alongside model's internal confidence in the absence of ground-truth labels. We show that effectively combining PRM with self-certainty can lead to both stable training and better test-time performance, and also keep the model's internal confidence in check."

We propose Conformal Aggregation of One-Shot Predictors (CAOS), a conformal framework that adaptively aggregates multiple one-shot predictors and uses a leave-one-out calibration scheme to fully exploit scarce labeled data. Despite violating classical exchangeability assumptions, we prove that CAOS achieves valid marginal coverage using a monotonicity-based argument.

To address this shortcoming, we develop a \"4pi\" full-heliosphere event forecasting framework and evaluate its statistical classification ability against this specific challenge. A magnetic surface flux transport model is used to generate full-sun maps of the photospheric radial magnetic field from which active regions (ARs) are identified and tracked using a new labeling scheme that is observer-location agnostic and allows for post-facto modifications. Flare-relevant magnetic parameters couple to a \"visibility\" index that specifies AR location relative to the visible solar limb and expected flare detection. Flare labels are assigned according to peak Soft X-ray flux, and a statistical classification is performed using nonparametric discriminant analysis. A version where new or emerging ARs on the far (\"invisible\" side of the Sun are incorporated into the model by way of far-side helioseismology, is also tested. We evaluate the new framework by its performance specifically including the limb areas using Brier Skill Score and ROC Skill Score, finding improvement at the 2-sigma level or less. However, we do find that the number of False Negatives, or \"missed\" forecasts decreases, and find strong evidence that the additional information provided by the far-side helioseismology can help predict near- and just-beyond-limb flares, particularly for East-limb events. While individual components of this framework could be improved, we demonstrate that a known failure mode for solar flare forecasting can be mitigated with available resources."

    "abstract": "Learned multivector representations power modern search systems with strong retrieval effectiveness, but their real-world use is limited by the high cost of exhaustive token-level retrieval. Therefore, most systems adopt a \\emph{gather-and-refine} strategy, where a lightweight gather phase selects candidates for full scoring. However, this approach requires expensive searches over large token-level indexes and often misses the documents that would rank highest under full similarity. In this paper, we reproduce several state-of-the-art multivector retrieval methods on two publicly available datasets, providing a clear picture of the current multivector retrieval field and observing the inefficiency of token-level gathering. Building on top of that, we show that replacing the token-level gather phase with a single-vector document retriever -- specifically, a learned sparse retriever (LSR) -- produces a smaller and more semantically coherent candidate set. This recasts the gather-and-refine pipeline into the well-established two-stage retrieval architecture. As retrieval latency decreases, query encoding with two neural encoders becomes the dominant computational bottleneck. To mitigate this, we integrate recent inference-free LSR methods, demonstrating that they preserve the retrieval effectiveness of the dual-encoder pipeline while substantially reducing query encoding time. Finally, we investigate multiple reranking configurations that balance efficiency, memory, and effectiveness, and we introduce two optimization techniques that prune low-quality candidates early. Empirical results show that these techniques improve retrieval efficiency by up to 1.8$\\times$ with no loss in quality. Overall, our two-stage approach achieves over $24\\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art multivector retrieval systems, while maintaining comparable or superior retrieval quality."

In this framework, right-handed neutrinos typically have $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings, which induce strong washout effects and render conventional thermal leptogenesis ineffective. We demonstrate that a successful baryogenesis scenario can nevertheless be realized through non-thermal leptogenesis, where right-handed neutrinos are produced from the decay of the heavy $B\\!-\\!L$ Higgs boson $χ$. We explicitly analyze the interplay between the dilution factor $T_R/M_χ$ and the washout parameter characteristic of the ISS, highlighting the tension between suppressing washout effects and maintaining sufficient reheating. We show that a viable lepton asymmetry can be generated provided the scalar mass spectrum is appropriately tuned, allowing for a reduced reheating temperature while keeping washout under control. The resulting lepton asymmetry is efficiently converted into the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via sphaleron processes. Our results establish that the inverse-seesaw $B\\!-\\!L$ model remains a predictive and robust framework for non-thermal leptogenesis and baryogenesis."

One key challenge is to resolve the integer ambiguity problem, as the carrier phase provides only relative position information. This work introduces and studies a multi-band CPP scenario with intra- and inter-band carrier aggregation (CA) opportunities across FR1, mmWave-FR2, and emerging 6G FR3 bands. Specifically, we derive multi-band CPP performance bounds, showcasing the superiority of multi-band CPP for high-precision localization in current and future mobile networks, while noting also practical imperfections such as clock offsets between the user equipment (UE) and the network as well as mutual clock imperfections between the network nodes. A wide collection of numerical results is provided, covering the impacts of the available carrier bandwidth, number of aggregated carriers, transmit power, and the number of network nodes or base stations. The offered results highlight that only two carriers suffice to substantially facilitate resolving the integer ambiguity problem while also largely enhancing the robustness of positioning against imperfections imposed by the network-side clocks and multi-path propagation. In addition, we also propose a two-stage practical estimator that achieves the derived bounds under all realistic bandwidth and transmit power conditions. Furthermore, we show that with an additional search-based refinement step, the proposed estimator becomes particularly suitable for narrowband Internet of Things applications operating efficiently even under narrow carrier bandwidths. Finally, both the derived bounds and the proposed estimators are extended to scenarios where the bands assigned to each base station are nonuniform or fully disjoint, enhancing the practical deployment flexibility."

    "abstract": "Recently, Quantum Visual Fields (QVFs) have shown promising improvements in model compactness and convergence speed for learning the provided 2D or 3D signals. Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of larger models and intensive training. In this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterised quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models compared to the classical counterpart. We present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility. Our experiments demonstrate that -- when trained on images of moderate resolution -- QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters. These results suggest that quantum machine learning can serve as a competitive alternative for continuous signal representation in mid-level tasks in computer vision, such as 3D representation learning from 2D observations."

However, existing geometry foundation models still suffer severely from flying pixels and the loss of fine details. In this paper, we present pixel-perfect visual geometry models that can predict high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds by leveraging generative modeling in the pixel space. We first introduce Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD), a monocular depth foundation model built upon pixel-space diffusion transformers (DiT). To address the high computational complexity associated with pixel-space diffusion, we propose two key designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted DiT, which incorporates semantic representations from vision foundation models to prompt the diffusion process, preserving global semantics while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT architecture that progressively increases the number of image tokens, improving both efficiency and accuracy. To further extend PPD to video (PPVD), we introduce a new Semantics-Consistent DiT, which extracts temporally consistent semantics from a multi-view geometry foundation model. We then perform reference-guided token propagation within the DiT to maintain temporal coherence with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our models achieve the best performance among all generative monocular and video depth estimation models and produce significantly cleaner point clouds than all other models."

For identical ions ($^{40}\\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), the inversions proceed via a \\textit{Berry pseudo-rotation} mechanism with a low activation barrier, enabled by the permutation symmetry, in contrast to the \\textit{umbrella inversion} observed in ammonia.

The measurements were performed using a homemade optical nanocell filled with atomic cesium and featuring a wedge-shaped gap between the inner surfaces of sapphire windows. For atom-surface distances below approximately $300$\\,nm, a significant red shift of the atomic transition frequency is observed due to van der Waals (vdW) interactions with the dielectric surface. An additional red shift arises at high vapor pressures owing to Cs-Cs interactions, with a measured contribution of $15$\\,MHz/Torr, which must be accounted for in order to correctly determine the vdW coefficient $C_3$.

Among other things, we find infrared-optical and X-ray decision boundaries for separating AGN/Stars, and infrared-X-ray boundaries for YSOs. These results are crucial for estimating object classes even with limited multiwavelength data. This study represents one of the earliest applications of XAI to large-scale astronomical datasets, demonstrating ML models' potential for uncovering physically meaningful patterns in data in addition to classification.

    "abstract": "We construct the index saddle for the supersymmetric F1--P black ring. Our construction proceeds by taking a supersymmetric limit of a non-supersymmetric doubly spinning F1--P black ring. We express the resulting saddle as a three-center Bena--Warner solution. The black ring saddle possesses a finite-area event horizon, yet the two-derivative index vanishes. The solution is singular on certain subspaces of the horizon, where higher-derivative corrections are expected to become important. We argue that, once such corrections are taken into account, the solution can yield a finite result. In particular, we present a scaling analysis showing that the index agrees with the microscopic result, up to an overall numerical constant that cannot be fixed by the scaling argument alone. This analysis applies only within a restricted region of parameter space, whose full significance is not yet fully understood."

    "abstract": "Many-body chaos is a default property of many-body systems; at the same time, near-integrable behaviour due to weakly interacting quasiparticles is ubiquitous throughout condensed matter at low temperature. There must therefore be a, possibly generic, crossover between these very different regimes. Here, we develop a theory encapsulating the notion of a cascade of lightcones seeded by sequences of scattering of weakly interacting harmonic modes as witnessed by a suitably defined chaos diagnostic (classical decorrelator) that measures the spatiotemporal profile of many-body chaos. Our numerics deals with the concrete case of a classical Heisenberg chain, for either sign of the interaction, at low temperatures where the short-time dynamics are well captured in terms of non-interacting spin waves. To model low-temperature dynamics, we use ensembles of initial states with randomly embedded point defects in an otherwise ordered background, which provides a controlled setting for studying the scattering events. The decorrelator exhibits a short-time integrable regime followed by an intermediate `scarred' regime of the cascade of lightcones in progress; these then overlap, leading to an avalanche of scattering events which finally yields the standard long-time signature of many-body chaos."

    "abstract": "We study inflationary dynamics within the framework of fractal cosmology, where spacetime exhibits a non-integer effective dimension, sourced through a relaxation of the cosmological principle. Using Friedmann and continuity equations, modified by an effective fractal dimension $D$; we derive generalized slow-roll parameters and examine their evolution for cubic, Starobinsky and Natural inflationary potentials. We then formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{\\text{eff}}$, arising from the fractal decomposition of the spatial Laplacian, that captures the geometric influence of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations. This leads to corrections in the power spectrum and a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that depends explicitly on both the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$, which controls the strength of the fractal deformation. Comparison with the Planck 2018 data ($n_s=0.9649\\pm 0.0042$) constrains the allowed range of $D$ ($2.7\\lesssim D\\lesssim3$) depending on the cosmological and inflationary model assumed."

    "abstract": "A key challenge in network science is the detection of communities, which are sets of nodes in a network that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of the network. A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erdős--Rényi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities."

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve performance, reliability, and interpretability by generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but this transparency introduces a serious privacy risk: intermediate reasoning often leaks personally identifiable information (PII) even when final answers are sanitized. We study how to induce privacy-first reasoning, where models reason without exposing sensitive information, using deployable interventions rather than post-hoc redaction. We introduce PII-CoT-Bench, a supervised dataset with privacy-aware CoT annotations, and a category-balanced evaluation benchmark covering realistic and adversarial leakage scenarios. Our results reveal a capability-dependent trend: state-of-the-art models benefit most from prompt-based controls, whereas weaker models require fine-tuning to achieve meaningful leakage reduction. Across models and categories, both approaches substantially reduce PII exposure with minimal degradation in utility, demonstrating that private reasoning can be achieved without sacrificing performance. Overall, we show that private CoT reasoning can be achieved with minimal utility loss, providing practical guidance for building privacy-preserving reasoning systems."

Both the spatial and time approximation in Summation-By-Parts (SBP) form are considered here. The initial and boundary conditions are imposed weakly using the Simultaneous Approximation Term (SAT) technique. The resulting SBP-SAT formulation yields an energy estimate in terms of the initial and external boundary data, leading to an energy-stable discretization in both space and time. The proposed method is evaluated numerically using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS). The scheme achieves super-convergence in both spatial and temporal direction with accuracy $\\mathcal{O}(p+2)$ for $p\\geq 2$, where $p$ refers to the degree of the Lagrange basis. In an application case, we show that the fully discrete formulation efficiently captures space-time variations even on coarse meshes, demonstrating the method's computational effectiveness."

    "abstract": "We provide the first lattice-QCD estimate of the crossover line down to $T\\simeq108$~MeV. We introduce a new method that combines the Lee-Yang edge in the complex plane of baryon chemical potential $μ_B$ with universal chiral scaling to determine the $μ_B$ dependence of the QCD chiral critical and pseudo-critical temperatures. By performing $(2\\!+\\!1)$-flavor lattice QCD simulations at $T\\simeq108$~MeV and purely imaginary $μ_B$ with a single lattice spacing and two volumes, we compute $μ_B$-dependent baryon-number susceptibilities and extract the location of the Lee-Yang edge. Together with universal scaling near the QCD chiral transition, it constrains the mapping function between $\\{T,μ_B\\}$ and the scaling variable (\\textit{i.e.}\\ the argument of the universal scaling functions). This mapping function then yields the $μ_B$ dependence of the critical and pseudo-critical temperatures for $T\\gtrsim108$~MeV. While our calculation is performed only at a single value of low temperature without explicit input from small-$μ_B$ expansion, the resulting $μ_B$ dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature is consistent with established lattice-QCD determinations at small $μ_B$ and compatible with chemical freeze-out parameters of heavy-ion collisions down to low temperatures, demonstrating the validity and robustness of the method. Application of this method can be systematically extended to additional temperatures and finer discretizations, opening a pathway to charting the QCD phase diagram in the low-$T$, high-$μ_B$ regime."

We prove that finding a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$ for a connectivity function given by an oracle is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), by providing an algorithm of running time $2^{O(k^2)} γn^6 \\log n$, where $γ$ is the time to compute $f(X)$ for any set $X$, and $n = |V|$. This improves the previous algorithm by Oum and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser.~B, 2007], which runs in time $γn^{O(k)}$. Our algorithm can be applied to rank-width of graphs, branch-width of matroids, branch-width of (hyper)graphs, and carving-width of graphs. This resolves an open problem asked by Hliněný [SIAM J. Comput., 2005], who asked whether branch-width of matroids given by the rank oracle is fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the best known dependency on $k$ in the running times of FPT algorithms for graph branch-width, rank-width, and carving-width."

    "abstract": "Approximation semantics capture the observable behaviour of λ-terms, with Böhm Trees and Taylor Expansion standing as two central paradigms. Although conceptually different, these notions are related via the Commutation Theorem, which links the Taylor expansion of a term to that of its Böhm tree. These notions are well understood in Call-by-Name λ-calculus and have been more recently introduced in Call-by-Value settings. Since these two evaluation strategies traditionally require separate theories, a natural next step is to seek a unified setting for approximation semantics. The Bang-calculus offers exactly such a framework, subsuming both CbN and CbV through linear-logic translations while providing robust rewriting properties. However, its approximation semantics is yet to be fully developed. In this work, we develop the approximation semantics for dBang, the Bang-calculus with explicit substitutions and distant reductions. We define Böhm trees and Taylor expansion within dBang and establish their fundamental properties. Our results subsume and generalize Call-By-Name and Call-By-Value through their translations into Bang, offering a single framework that uniformly captures infinitary and resource-sensitive semantics across evaluation strategies."

The method exploits the capabilities of DMRG to accurately describe systems with strong static correlation, while the FQ model provides a self-consistent and physically grounded representation of solvent polarization within a QM/MM embedding. The DMRG/FQ approach is applied to representative solvated systems, using extensive molecular dynamics sampling. The method yields reliable excitation energies, solvatochromic shifts, and a close agreement with available experimental data. The results highlight the importance of mutual polarization for capturing specific solute-solvent interactions, particularly in systems where hydrogen bonding or directional interactions play a dominant role."

    "abstract": "The efficient interfacing of quantum emitters and photons is fundamental to quantum networking. Quantum defects embedded in integrated nanophotonic circuits are promising for such applications due to the deterministic light-matter interactions of high-cooperativity ($C>1$) cavity quantum electrodynamics and potential for scalable integration with active photonic processing. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip. Here we realize the first high-cooperativity coupling of quantum defects to hybrid-integrated nanophotonics in a scalable, planar platform. We integrate more than 600 gallium phosphide (GaP) nanophotonic cavities on a diamond substrate with near-surface SiV centers. We examine a particular device with two strongly coupled SiV centers in detail, confirming above-unity cooperativity via multiple independent measurements. Application of an external magnetic field via a permanent magnet enables optical resolution of the SiV spin transitions from which we determine a spin-relaxation time $T_1>0.4$ ms at 4 K. We utilize the high cooperativity coupling to observe spin-dependent transmission switching and the quantum jumps of the SiV spin via single-shot readout. These results, coupled with GaP's strong nonlinear properties, establish GaP-on-diamond as a scalable planar platform for quantum network applications."

    "abstract": "Specifications for representing three-dimensional (3D) maps for robotics and automation are provided in this standard. A recommended format for exchanging map data among robots, computers, and other devices is defined in this standard. The representation format specified by this standard considers static maps and describes their elements and associated uncertainty independently of the geographic scale and sensor modalities used to build the maps. In particular, this standard (a) defines a hierarchy of terminologies related to 3D robot maps for robotics and automation; (b) specifies a data model for each element of the hierarchy; and (c) specifies a JSON format for map data exchange between different robots, computer systems, and devices. This standard provides formats for exchanging 3D map data between robots and devices (e.g., by transmitting them over a communication channel or by saving them on some storing devices). This standard is not intended to affect internal formats that robots and devices use to build, update, and use maps."

    "abstract": "Quantum feature selection offers a powerful route to extracting informative features from high-dimensional data by exploiting quantum parallelism and superposition. However, most existing methods focus on single-view data and fail to address the challenges of multi-view scenarios, where heterogeneous views must be integrated while maintaining the fidelity of each view. In such scenarios, achieving both inter-view complementarity and intra-view consistency is difficult due to complex dependencies and latent structures within each view. To address this problem, we propose Quantum Multi-View Feature Selection (QMVFS), a unified framework that combines configurable quantum kernel circuits with adaptive multi-kernel fusion. For each view, configurable quantum kernel circuits with distinct architectures and parameterizations embed data into a Hilbert space, producing diverse kernel representations. An integrated optimization objective jointly learns view weights, fuses multiple kernels, and enforces sparsity, enabling QMVFS to capture inter-view synergy while preserving intra-view structures. Experiments on six public multi-view datasets show that QMVFS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.44% in classification accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability for quantum-enhanced multi-view learning.

    "abstract": "As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) lead the way in the development of future digital smart cities, they continue to face scrutiny due to safety concerns. While robotics simulators offer UAVs efficient and cost-effective testing environments, they often lack comprehensive safety design considerations and user testing requirements. In this study, we introduce RflySimSaT, a dedicated safety testing platform for UAVs that addresses safety factors throughout the entire lifecycle. This platform incorporates diverse fault testing scenarios, high-fidelity dynamic models, an integrated safety assessment framework, standardized testing procedures, and customizable interfaces. The modular architecture and deployment of RflySimSaT facilitate plug-and-play cross-platform closed-loop safety testing. Users simply need to supply their aircrafts and autopilots, enabling them to efficiently navigate the phases of development, deployment, testing, and assessment using the customizable modules and standardized processes offered by the platform. To validate RflySimSaT’s credibility and versatility, we designed various test cases that demonstrate its practicality and scalability. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive user manual, detailed case studies, and a rich fault dataset. The platform is open-source and available at: https://github.com/RflySim/RFlySimSafe/tree/RflySimSaT."

    "abstract": "Image cropping aims to find more attractive crops for users by recomposing images. With the development of mobile social media, the significance of this technology is increasingly evident. Most existing methods focus on learning from average cropping results and rely on objective image features for image cropping. However, the subjectivity of image cropping and the preferences of people are often overlooked in this paradigm. In this work, we analyze the difference between individual users and average users, proposing a new task called personalized image cropping (PIC). Compared to existing methods, the PIC model not only requires generic cropping features but also captures personalized preferences from a small set of user data. Nevertheless, as a typical few-shot learning problem, direct training is inherently challenging. To address this issue, we first construct a prior model that includes both user subjective features and image objective features. Considering the difficulty in explicitly modeling subjective features, we propose an individual preference module to embed user attributes into a continuous latent space and explore their cropping preferences. Then, the model is jointly trained on PIC tasks to integrate two features, facilitating the transfer of prior knowledge to evaluate user-specific cropping. Finally, by fine-tuning with a small set of annotations, we can obtain the individualized PIC model for each user. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the necessity of the PIC task and the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "A framework that could achieve submeter-level unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) horizontal navigation in multipath-free environments with cellular carrier phase measurements is developed. This framework exploits the “loose” synchronization between cellular base transceiver station (BTS) clocks. It is shown through extensive experimental data that the beat frequency stability of cellular BTSs approaches that of atomic standards and that the clock deviations can be realized as a stable autoregressive moving average model. This BTS clock model is referred to as loose network synchronization. A rule-of-thumb is established for clustering the clock deviations to minimize the position estimation error, while significantly reducing the computational complexity. The presented models allow the UAV to achieve sustained carrier phase-based meter- to submeter-accurate navigation. To demonstrate the efficacy of the developed framework, this article presents three UAV flight experiments in Southern California, USA, utilizing signals from different cellular providers transmitting at different frequencies. The three experiments took place in open, semiurban environments with nearly multipath-free, line-of-sight (LOS) conditions, in which the UAV traveled 1.72, 3.07, and 0.61 km, achieving a horizontal position root mean squared error of 36.61, 88.58, and 89.33 cm, respectively, with respect to the UAV’s on-board navigation system."

The portion of a defect universe, comprising thousands or millions of reasonably likely defects, that is detected or “covered” by tests of analog and mixed-signal circuits depends on many factors, which this standard considers, such as detectability, process variations, defect characteristics, and redundancy. The contents of a defect coverage summary are specified and dozens of commonly used terms are clearly defined to aid communication about the quality of tested ICs."
