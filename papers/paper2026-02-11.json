    "abstract": "The convergence of self-consistent field equations in mean-field nuclear-electronic orbital methods strongly depends on the choice of initial guesses for quantum nuclei. Although several such guesses have been proposed in the literature, a systematic comparison of their performance as well as attempts of constructing novel approximations based on model tasks of quantum mechanics were not reported to date. In this work, we address both issues by introducing novel nuclear initial guesses derived from the analytical solutions of the three-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and benchmarking them against existing approaches. We demonstrate that the isotropic variant of our guess outperforms existing approximations in nuclear-electronic orbital density functional theory calculations employing a simultaneous self-consistent field convergence protocol. Although our guess requires the computation of partial Hessians, we demonstrate that these can be evaluated with low-cost methods without affecting the accuracy of resulting protonic density matrices. Our results demonstrate that the proposed guess is robust and efficient and could provide a route to improved convergence in mean-field nuclear-electronic orbital computations."

    "abstract": "We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\\% of the original model's performance at 30\\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline."

    "abstract": "Despite the great success Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) has achieved, the delocalization error remains a major challenge for commonly used density functional approximations (DFAs), resulting in systematic errors in ionization energies, electron affinities, band structures, and charge distributions. A recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) method, namely linear response LOSC (lrLOSC), addresses these challenges by incorporating a functional correction that includes the screening effect and orbital localization within the LOSC framework. The method has been shown to provide accurate descriptions of bulk systems and core-level binding energies in small molecular systems. In this work, we extend the applicability of lrLOSC to a broader range of molecular systems, spanning various sizes, with a focus on the corrections to valence orbital energies and total energies. To enable the calculation of large chemical systems, we developed an efficient implementation of lrLOSC with computational costs comparable to standard KS-DFT calculations. Numerical results show that, while screening provides modest improvements for small molecules, it becomes critical for achieving high accuracy in larger molecules, from linear to three-dimensional systems. With the screening effect well captured in a unified way, lrLOSC provides accurate descriptions for a wide range of chemical systems, including organic molecular systems of varying sizes and transition-metal oxide complexes, establishing it as a powerful tool for enhancing the reliability of computational simulations of chemical systems."

    "abstract": "Developing efficient GPU kernels is essential for scaling modern AI systems, yet it remains a complex task due to intricate hardware architectures and the need for specialized optimization expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x. Our work demonstrates that targeted post-training with reinforcement learning can unlock LLM capabilities in highly specialized technical domains where traditional supervised learning is limited by data availability, opening new pathways for AI-assisted accelerator programming."

Forthcoming facilities will be able to check whether these tensions result from systematic effects or indeed with the $Λ$CDM model itself. However, these new data will primarily probe gravitational interactions and provide only limited information about non-gravitational interactions. Distinguishing between competing models that make similar predictions yet rely on fundamentally different principles, therefore requires suitably diverse physical tests. Observational constraints on spacetime variations of fundamental constants fill this need. The fine-structure constant, $α= e^2/\\hbar c$, can be measured using absorption systems towards bright quasars using the Many Multiplet method, and using atomic doublets from line emitting gas in galaxies. A spectroscopic facility such as the WST could produce more than 100,000 new measurements of $α$ from quasars together with a million measurements from galaxies. When combined with other probes, such a large and homogeneous dataset of $α$ measurements would provide unprecedented constraints on physics beyond $Λ$CDM."

This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods. Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems."

    "abstract": "Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research."

The integrated X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) from high-mass X-ray binaries in star-forming galaxies scales with both the star formation rate (SFR) and host-galaxy metallicity $Z$. Due to the inverse correlation between $L_X/\\mathrm{SFR}$ and $Z$, the contribution of X-ray binaries to the ionizing photon budget is enhanced in metal-poor systems and may ionize He II in the surrounding interstellar medium, powering nebular He II $\\lambda4686$ emission. The blue compact dwarf galaxy ESO 338-IG04 (ESO 338-4) provides a nearby laboratory for studying stellar feedback in a low-metallicity starburst, combining vigorous recent star formation, low metallicity ($12+\\log(\\mathrm{O/H})\\approx7.9$), and a rich population of massive stellar clusters. We characterize the X-ray emission of ESO 338-4 and its halo using new deep Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We analyze X-ray spectra, light curves, and images to constrain the nature of its X-ray sources. We identify five ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and diffuse hot gas surrounding the galaxy. Two ULXs are spatially associated with stellar clusters. The total X-ray luminosity exceeds $10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$. The brightest source, ULX1, shows variability on day timescales and lacks a stellar-cluster counterpart. Photoionization modeling shows that X-ray sources significantly impact the ionizing photon budget; models with ULX1 as the ionizing source predict nebular He II $\\lambda4686$ luminosities of $\\sim10^{39}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$."

    "abstract": "Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications."

The resulting discrete model possesses several desirable features: it ensures volume conservation of the discrete elements by considering cross-sectional deformation through a local dilatation factor, it demonstrates the beneficial properties associated with the variational integrator technique, such as the preservation of the rotational configuration, and energy conservation with a bounded error. An exhaustive set of numerical results under various initial conditions of the rod demonstrates the efficacy of the model in replicating the physics of the system."

A multi-antenna base station (BS) with transmitting fluid antennas serves downlink users, energizes passive tags, and illuminates radar targets, while a spatially separated multi-antenna reader decodes tag backscatter and processes radar echoes to avoid the strong self-interference that would otherwise obscure weak returns at the BS. The coexistence of tags and targets, however, induces severe near--far disparities and multi-signal interference, which can be mitigated by fluid antennas through additional spatial degrees of freedom that reshape the multi-hop channels. We formulate a transmit-power minimization problem that jointly optimizes the BS information beamformers, sensing covariance matrix, reader receive beamformers, tag reflection coefficients, and fluid-antenna (FA) positions under heterogeneous quality of service constraints for communication, backscatter, and sensing, as well as energy-harvesting and FA geometry requirements. To tackle the resulting non-convex problem, we develop an alternating-optimization block-coordinate framework that solves four tractable subproblems using semidefinite relaxation, majorization--minimization, and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show consistent transmit-power savings over fixed-position antennas and zero-forcing baselines, achieving about 13.7% and 54.5% reductions, respectively."

We present SOAR, a training-free decoding algorithm that adapts its behavior to the model's uncertainty. When confidence is low, SOAR briefly widens the search over alternative unmasking decisions to avoid premature commitments; when confidence is high, it collapses the search and decodes many positions in parallel to reduce the number of denoising iterations. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks (GSM8K, MBPP, HumanEval) on Dream-7B and LLaDA-8B, SOAR improves generation quality while maintaining competitive inference speed, offering a practical way to balance quality and efficiency in DLM decoding."

Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value < 0.05). This preliminary exploratory study highlights the positive impact of utilizing Maya as an assistant for therapy/education in a clinical setting, particularly benefiting children undergoing cancer treatment. The findings underscore the potential of social robots in pediatric healthcare contexts, emphasizing improved pain management and emotional well-being among young patients."

Here, we report a membrane-enabled integration platform based on transferable single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 that overcomes these constraints at the system level. By exploiting the weak interplanar bonding of beta-Ga2O3 (100) plane, we obtain wafer-scale freestanding single-crystalline membranes that enable vertically integrated photodiodes with sub-microsecond, non-persistent photoresponse and high UV-visible rejection. Crucially, we introduce a stitching-based membrane assembly strategy that decouples array resolution from the size of the source single-crystalline substrate, allowing high-resolution photodetector arrays to be integrated onto silicon thin-film-transistor backplanes. The modular assembled active-matrix UV imaging arrays exhibit uniform solar-blind response without image lag, in stark contrast to arrays based on amorphous or polycrystalline films. Beyond beta-Ga2O3, this membrane-enabled and stitching-based modular integration strategy provides a general route toward high-speed, high-resolution electronic imaging systems using transferable single-crystalline semiconductors."

    "abstract": "Large-scale diffusion models such as FLUX (12B parameters) and Stable Diffusion 3 (8B parameters) require multi-GPU parallelism for efficient inference. Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \\textbf{1.12$\\times$--1.16$\\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \\textbf{1.09$\\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\\times$--1.46$\\times$ of 2-GPU performance. We further provide a detailed analysis of the performance characteristics of distributed diffusion inference, revealing that kernel launch overhead -- rather than communication latency -- is the primary bottleneck on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects."

Fitting this individual-level data requires inference on individuals' unobserved disease statuses over time, which form a high-dimensional and highly correlated state space. We introduce a novel Bayesian (data-augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm for jointly estimating the model parameters and unobserved disease statuses, which we call the Rippler algorithm. This is a non-centred method that can be applied to any individual-based state-transition model. We compare the Rippler algorithm to the state-of-the-art inference methods for individual-based stochastic epidemic models and find that it performs better than these methods as the number of disease states in the model increases."

Long-term N-body integrations show that most orbits with the retrograde configuration remain dynamically stable for at least 10 Myr, while orbits with the prograde motion might rapidly evolve into chaos or lead to ejection. The retrograde architecture points to a violent dynamical history, possibly involving von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles or three-body scattering, while the prograde scenario might be consistent with coplanar and mild disk migration.

Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument. Experiments corroborate our theoretical findings."

The observed detection rate of transient lensed stars -- individual, massive, thus luminous stars in strongly lensed galaxies that are temporarily detectable upon stellar microlensing -- can serve as a probe to break the IMF-star formation history degeneracy in studies utilizing spectral energy distribution fitting, hence providing a window to look at the IMF at a subsample of gravitationally lensed galaxies.

This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead. Empirical evaluations on representative bilevel learning tasks further demonstrate the practical advantages of NHGD, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in large-scale machine learning settings."

This necessitates the development of new track finding algorithms to mitigate detector performance degradation. Building on our previous success with an end-to-end multi-track reconstruction algorithm for the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider (arXiv:2411.13596), we have extended the algorithm to incorporate inputs from both the drift chamber and the silicon vertex tracking detector, creating a multi-modal network. We employ graph neural networks to handle the irregular detector structure and object condensation to address the unknown, varying number of particles in each event. This approach simultaneously identifies all tracks in an event and determines their respective parameters. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness using a realistic full detector simulation, which incorporates beam-induced backgrounds and noise modelled from actual collision data. The simultaneous reconstruction of the information from the two detectors yields a track efficiency improvement from 48.0 % to 74.7 % for uniformly displaced particles up to 100 cm, while increasing the track purity by 5.5 percentage points. We provide a detailed comparison of its track-finding performance against the current Belle II baseline across various event topologies."

Starting from a general metric characterized by an arbitrary lapse function and areal radius, we derive curvature invariants, establish regularity conditions at the wormhole throat, and reduce the Klein-Gordon equation to a Helmholtz-type radial wave equation. This formulation naturally leads to a position- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index determined by the underlying spacetime geometry and Lorentz-violating structure, resulting in effective frequency-dependent wave-optical behavior. We show that divergences of the refractive index coincide with Killing horizons, while curvature-induced turning points control reflection, transmission, and confinement of scalar waves. By analyzing constant, linear, and quadratic lapse profiles, we identify horizonless transmission regimes, asymmetric wave propagation, and multi-horizon trapping structures. Our results reveal that Lorentz violation can significantly modify wave-optical properties of curved spacetime, generating graded-index analogues and geometric confinement of modes without curvature singularities. This unified optical perspective provides a robust framework for investigating wave scattering, resonances, and potential observational signatures in Lorentz-violating gravitational backgrounds."

    "abstract": "Despite the extensive body of work on backstepping for one-dimensional PDEs, results in higher dimensions remain comparatively limited. Most available methods either exploit particular symmetries of the PDE or address problems posed on parallelepiped domains. To the best of our knowledge, the only approach that enables the design of backstepping controllers on non-parallelepiped regions without symmetry assumptions is the domain extension technique. This method, however, presents several drawbacks. In particular, the control input at each time instant is obtained by simulating a PDE on an extended domain, from which the actual input on the original domain is approximated. By contrast, in the one-dimensional setting, once the time-independent backstepping gain kernel is known, the control input can be computed in closed form as a feedback depending solely on the state at that same instant. Moreover, problems such as output-feedback design or adaptive and robust control do not appear straightforward to address with the domain extension method, at least to the best of our knowledge. These considerations motivate the search, whenever possible, for alternatives that preserve the main advantages of one-dimensional backstepping. A motivating example for the domain extension method is the control of the heat equation on a piano-shaped domain, with actuation applied at the tail of the piano. In this extended abstract, we show through a simple calculation that the domain extension method is not required in this setting. Instead, a strategy akin to that used for parallelepiped domains can be adopted. This result constitutes a first instance of a broader framework for backstepping control of asymmetric PDEs posed on non-parallelepiped regions, which we refer to as domains with graph-monotone boundaries. The general framework is developed in a forthcoming paper."

To train semantic segmentation models, labeled point cloud segmentation datasets are essential. Meanwhile, point cloud labeling is time-consuming for annotators, which typically involves tuning the camera viewpoint and selecting points by lasso. To reduce the time cost of point cloud labeling, we propose a viewpoint recommendation approach to reduce annotators' labeling time costs. We adapt Fitts' law to model the time cost of lasso selection in point clouds. Using the modeled time cost, the viewpoint that minimizes the lasso selection time cost is recommended to the annotator. We build a data labeling system for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds that integrates our viewpoint recommendation approach. The system enables users to navigate to recommended viewpoints for efficient annotation. Through an ablation study, we observed that our approach effectively reduced the data labeling time cost. We also qualitatively compare our approach with previous viewpoint selection approaches on different datasets."

We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments.

At first glance, the apparently passive nature of the port-Hamiltonian system seems incompatible with the active power injection required to sustain this non-equilibrium condition. However, we demonstrate that the discontinuity inherent in the vector field provides the additional energy needed to maintain this operating point, indicating that the system is not globally passive. Moreover, when the discontinuity is replaced by a continuous approximation, the resulting system becomes cyclo-dissipative while still capable of supplying the required power."

Here we use low-field magnetotransport (B < 1 T) to reconstruct the dispersions of the two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole branches (HH-, HH+) in undoped (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunction 2DHGs operated in an accumulation-mode field-effect geometry. The dopant-free devices sustain out-of-plane electric fields up to 26 kV/cm while maintaining mobilities up to 84 m$^2$/Vs and exhibiting a spin-orbit polarization as large as 36%. Fourier analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations resolves the individual HH-/HH+ subband densities; fitting the temperature dependence of the corresponding Fourier amplitudes yields both branch-resolved SdH effective masses over the same magnetic field window. SdH regimes in which reliable subband parameters can be extracted are delineated. Over 2DHG densities (0.76-1.9) $\\times$ 10$^{15}$ /m$^2$, the HH- mass is nearly density independent ($\\approx 0.34m_e$), implying a near-parabolic HH- dispersion below the first LH+/HH- anticrossing, whereas HH+ exhibits strong non-parabolicity with an effective mass that increases with density. Combining the extracted dispersions yields a transport-based determination of the spin-orbit splitting energy $Δ_\\text{HH}$ between HH and HH+ as a function of in-plane wave vector. Parameter-free Luttinger-model calculations reproduce the qualitative trends but underestimate both masses by a common factor $\\approx$ 2, suggesting a many-body renormalization of the heavy-hole mass in this strongly asymmetric regime."

We characterize the chemical composition and isotopic ratios of the CSE of AFGL2233 and investigate chemical peculiarities, including the presence of N- and O-bearing species in a C-rich environment. We carried out a complete line survey at 3 mm and 1 mm using the IRAM 30m telescope, complemented by Herschel/HIFI FIR observations and interferometric maps of SiO, C2H, and HCN. Molecular emission was analyzed using rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modeling under the LVG approximation. Column densities and fractional abundances were derived for more than 30 molecular species, including isotopologues, and compared with other evolved stars. The Gaia DR3 distance of 1.236 kpc implies a luminosity of ~2 Lsun, consistent with an initial mass of 4.5-9 Msun. The molecular inventory confirms C-rich chemistry but reveals unusually high abundances of NH3, H2O, and SiN. The isotopic ratios vary among species, with 12C/13C ranging from 7 to 55. The C2H/C4H ratio is abnormally high compared with C-rich AGB stars. The presence of SiN and high NH3 may indicate N-enrichment or the influence of a companion. AFGL2233 is likely a high-mass AGB or super-AGB star with a complex evolutionary history involving nucleosynthesis, shocks, and possible binary interaction."

We study the time complexity of estimating $π(s,t)$ with constant relative error and constant failure probability, whenever $π(s,t)$ is above a given threshold parameter $δ\\in(0,1)$. We consider common graph-access models and furthermore study the single source, single target, and single node (PageRank centrality) variants of the problem. We provide a complete characterization of PPR estimation in undirected graphs by giving tight bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for all problems and model variants in both the worst-case and average-case setting. This includes both new upper and lower bounds. Tight bounds were recently obtained by Bertram, Jensen, Thorup, Wang, and Yan for directed graphs. However, their lower bound constructions rely on asymmetry and therefore do not carry over to undirected graphs. At the same time, undirected graphs exhibit additional structure that can be exploited algorithmically. Our results resolve the undirected case by developing new techniques that capture both aspects, yielding tight bounds."

This enables a careful balance between accuracy and hardware resource utilization. Guided by this trade-off analysis, online sketch processing elements (SPEs) are implemented on an FPGA to directly process time-stamp streams from the SPAD sensor. The implementation is validated using a customized LiDAR setup with a 192 x 128-pixel SPAD array. This work demonstrates histogram-free online depth reconstruction with high fidelity, effectively alleviating the time-stamp transfer bottleneck of SPAD arrays and offering scalability as pixel counts continue to increase for future SPADs."

The formation of the cosmological compact objects intuitively is explained in terms of the topological line defects - the string like tubes. The strings can get an energetically preferable configuration corresponding to the magnetic flux quantum inside an area defined by the mass of dark vector field."

Path analysis results indicate that the four Design Thinking Skills, Problem-driven Design (beta = 0.198, p < 0.01), Information-driven Design (beta = 0.241, p < 0.001), Solution-driven Design (beta = 0.227, p < 0.001), and Knowledge-driven Design (beta = 0.263, p < 0.001) all significantly and positively influence Design Thinking. Furthermore, Design Thinking has a significant positive predictive effect on Design Creativity & Innovation (beta = 0.286, p < 0.001). Mediation analysis confirms three significant mediation paths: the CSE mediation path (beta = 0.128, p < 0.001), the CCE mediation path (beta = 0.073, p < 0.01), and the \"CSE to CCE\" chain mediation path (beta = 0.025, p < 0.01). Multi-group comparison results reveal significant differences between the student and professional groups under the full equivalence model. After relaxing specific constraints, there were no significant differences between the nested models of the baseline model, partial measurement invariance, structural weight invariance, and structural covariance invariance. These findings elucidate the multi-dimensional pathways of Design Creativity & Innovation, providing a robust empirical basis for optimizing differentiated pedagogical models and professional practice guidelines."

Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNetPart dataset demonstrate that DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot setting.

In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG).

We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability."

While this problem has been extensively studied on graphs, we focus on its strong extension to hypergraphs, where edges may connect any number of vertices. A set of vertices in a hypergraph is strongly independent if there is at most one vertex per edge in the set. One application for this problem is to find perfect minimal hash functions. We propose nine new data reduction rules specifically designed for this problem. Our reduction routine can serve as a preprocessing step for any solver. We analyze the impact on the size of the reduced instances and the performance of several subsequent solvers when combined with this preprocessing. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in instance size and improvements in running time for subsequent solvers. The preprocessing routine reduces instances, on average, to 22% of their original size in 6.76 seconds. When combining our reduction preprocessing with the best-performing exact solver, we observe an average speedup of 3.84x over not using the reduction rules. In some cases, we can achieve speedups of up to 53x. Additionally, one more instance becomes solvable by a method when combined with our preprocessing."

We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments."

    "abstract": "When sensitive information is encoded in data, it is important to ensure the privacy of information when attempting to learn useful information from the data. There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\\varepsilon,δ)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $Θ((\\varepsilon β)^{-2})$, where $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $β$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks."

However, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which serves as the primary mechanism for adapting VLAs to downstream domains, requires substantial amounts of task-specific data and is prone to catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose LifeLong-RFT, a simple yet effective Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) strategy for VLA models independent of online environmental feedback and pre-trained reward models. By integrating chunking-level on-policy reinforcement learning with the proposed Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism, LifeLong-RFT quantifies the heterogeneous contributions of intermediate action chunks across three dimensions to facilitate policy optimization. Specifically, (1) the Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) ensures accurate action prediction within the discrete action space; (2) the Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) aligns decoded continuous action chunks with reference trajectories to ensure precise control; (3) the Format Compliance Reward (FCR) guarantees the structural validity of outputs. Comprehensive experiments across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks demonstrate that LifeLong-RFT exhibits strong performance in multi-task learning. Furthermore, for continual learning on the LIBERO benchmark, our method achieves a 22% gain in average success rate over SFT, while effectively adapting to new tasks using only 20% of the training data. Overall, our method provides a promising post-training paradigm for VLAs."

The dataset comprises 13,348 labeled images collected through multiple methods, including DWaste mobile app and curated web sources. Methods included rigorous validation through checksums and outlier detection, analysis of class imbalance and visual separability via PCA/t-SNE, and assessment of background complexity using entropy and saliency measures. The dataset was benchmarked using state-of-the-art deep learning models (EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2S, MobileNet, ResNet50, ResNet101) evaluated on performance metrics and operational carbon emissions. Experiment results indicate EfficientNetV2S achieved the highest performance with 96.19% accuracy and a 0.96 F1-score, though with a moderate carbon cost. Analysis revealed inherent dataset characteristics including class imbalance, a skew toward high-outlier classes (plastic, cardboard, paper), and brightness variations that require consideration. The main conclusion is that GD provides a valuable, real-world benchmark for waste classification research while highlighting important challenges such as class imbalance, background complexity, and environmental trade-offs in model selection that must be addressed for practical deployment.

    "abstract": "We investigate the geometric structure of learning dynamics in overparameterized transformer models through carefully controlled modular arithmetic tasks. Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning."

We observe that even when auxiliary visual elements are interleaved, they are often treated as static snapshots within a one-dimensional, unstructured reasoning chain. We argue that such approaches treat reasoning history as an immutable stream: correcting a local error necessitates either generating verbose downstream corrections or regenerating the entire context. This forces the model to implicitly maintain and track state updates, significantly increasing token consumption and cognitive load. This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional domains, such as geometry and SVG design, where the textual expression of CoT lacks explicit visual guidance, further constraining the model's reasoning precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT)}. By leveraging a HTML Canvas as an external reasoning substrate, Canvas-CoT empowers the model to perform atomic, DOM-based CRUD operations. This architecture enables in-place state revisions without disrupting the surrounding context, allowing the model to explicitly maintain the \"ground truth\". Furthermore, we integrate a rendering-based critique loop that serves as a hard constraint validator, providing explicit visual feedback to resolve complex tasks that are difficult to articulate through text alone. Extensive experiments on VCode, RBench-V, and MathVista demonstrate that Canvas-CoT significantly outperforms existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for context-efficient multimodal reasoning."

This raises a natural family-level question: does the same phenomenon persist inside one-parameter families, where the local structure varies in a highly constrained way? In this paper we answer this in the negative for the pure fields $K_m=\\mathbb Q(α)$ with $α^n=m$ ($n\\ge 4$) and $m$ square-free. Writing $g(m)=[\\mathcal O_{K_m}:\\mathbb Z[α]]$, we prove that the set of square-free $m$ for which $g(m)>1$ but $K_m$ has no ABS local obstruction has natural density $0$.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose reasoning capabilities, yet they frequently hallucinate when used as world models (WMs), where strict compliance with deterministic transition rules--particularly in corner cases--is essential. In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy. Extensive experiments on three distinct interactive environments, i.e., ScienceWorld, Webshop, and Plancraft, demonstrate NeSyS's consistent advantages over baselines in both WM prediction accuracy and data efficiency."

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel numerical method for direct simulation of front propagation in the Fisher-KPP equation with a time-dependent parameter on an infinite domain. The method computes a time-dependent boundary condition that accurately captures the leading-edge dynamics by coupling the nonlinear simulation region to a linear approximation region in which the dynamics can be solved exactly via the Green's function of the linearized equation. This approach enables precise front velocity measurements on relatively small computational domains for a variety of nonautonomous regimes and initial conditions for which existing numerical methods break down. We apply the method to pulled and pushed fronts in the Fisher-KPP equation with quadratic and quadratic-cubic nonlinearities, finding that it improves the accuracy of the simulated front velocity even for constant parameters and a fixed domain size. For pulled fronts with a diffusion coefficient that increases algebraically in time, our results reveal a deviation from the natural asymptotic velocity predicted by linear theory, whose explanation requires nonlinear theory. For pushed fronts with constant parameters, the method reproduces the exponential convergence to the theoretical asymptotic front speed and profile with improved precision. For a slowly time-varying linear growth parameter, we find that the pushed front velocity follows the changing parameter adiabatically if the asymptotic pushed velocity remains faster than the natural asymptotic pulled velocity. As the growth parameter moves toward the pushed--pulled transition point, the competition between the pushed and pulled fronts can result in both delayed and even premature onset of the pushed--pulled transition, depending on the form of parameter growth. The numerical method presented here proves to be an effective tool for analyzing front propagation in nonautonomous systems."

The interaction can be enhanced by increasing the resonator's impedance, while approaching the quantum impedance ($h/e^2$) remains challenging. Edge plasmons emergent as chiral bosonic modes in the quantum Hall channels provide high quantized impedance of $h/ νe^2$ that can exceed 10 k$Ω$ for the Landau-level filling factor $ν\\leq 2$, well beyond the impedance of free space. Here, we apply such a high-impedance plasmon mode in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator to demonstrate dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot. The phase shift in microwave transmission through the plasmon resonator follows the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state in agreement with the cQED theory. The high impedance allows us to perform dispersive detection of qubit spectroscopy with a plasmon resonator having a broad bandwidth. Leveraging these topological edge modes, our results establish two-dimensional topological insulators as a new platform of cQED."

Our contributions are: (i) AgoraBench, a new benchmark spanning nine challenging settings (e.g., deception, monopoly) that supports diverse strategy modeling; (ii) human-aligned, economically grounded metrics derived from utility theory. This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning. Empirical results indicate that baseline LLM strategies often diverge from human preferences, while our mechanism substantially improves negotiation performance, yielding deeper strategic behavior and stronger opponent awareness."

    "abstract": "Informal and privatized transit services, such as minibuses and shared auto-rickshaws, are integral to daily travel in large urban metropolises, providing affordable commutes where a formal public transport system is inadequate and other options are unaffordable. Despite the crucial role that these services play in meeting mobility needs, governments often do not account for these services or their underlying incentives when planning transit systems, which can significantly compromise system efficiency. Against this backdrop, we develop a framework to analyze the incentives underlying informal and privatized transit systems, while proposing mechanisms to guide public transit operation and incentive design when a substantial share of mobility is provided by such profit-driven private operators. We introduce a novel, analytically tractable game-theoretic model of a fully privatized informal transit system with a fixed menu of routes, in which profit-maximizing informal operators (drivers) decide where to provide service and cost-minimizing commuters (riders) decide whether to use these services. Within this framework, we establish tight price of anarchy bounds which demonstrate that decentralized, profit-maximizing driver behavior can lead to bounded yet substantial losses in cumulative driver profit and rider demand served. We further show that these performance losses can be mitigated through targeted interventions, including Stackelberg routing mechanisms in which a modest share of drivers are centrally controlled, reflecting environments where informal operators coexist with public transit, and cross-subsidization schemes that use route-specific tolls or subsidies to incentivize drivers to operate on particular routes. Finally, we reinforce these findings through numerical experiments based on a real-world informal transit system in Nalasopara, India."

    "abstract": "Driven by scaling laws, recommender systems increasingly rely on large-scale models to capture complex feature interactions and user behaviors, but this trend also leads to prohibitive training and inference costs. While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory resources, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment."

    "abstract": "Policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) has established itself as the dominant paradigm in generative recommendation for optimizing sequential user interactions. However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks."

Protein sequences, in particular, exemplify this structure, yet most generative artificial intelligence models implicitly assume a homogeneous data distribution. We show that this assumption fundamentally breaks down in heterogeneous biological sequence spaces: fixed global noise levels impose a destructive trade-off, either oversmoothing dense functional clusters or fragmenting sparse regions and producing non-functional hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce \\emph{Density-Dependent Smoothing} (DDS), a geometry-aware generative framework that adapts stochastic smoothing to the local density of the underlying sequence landscape. By inversely coupling diffusion noise to estimated sequence density, DDS enables gentle refinement in high-density functional regions while promoting controlled exploration across sparse regions. Implemented as a plug-in mechanism for discrete molecular sampling, DDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive models across antibody repertoires, therapeutic antibody design, antimicrobial peptide generation and coronavirus antibody design. Together, these results show that fixed global smoothing assumptions fundamentally limit generative modeling in sparse biological sequence spaces, and that geometry-aware smoothing removes this constraint, enabling reliable exploration and design previously unattainable with fixed-noise generative models."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models are rapidly becoming core components of modern software development workflows, yet ensuring code security remains challenging. Existing vulnerability detection pipelines either rely on static analyzers or use LLM/GNN-based detectors trained with coarse program-level supervision. Both families often require complete context, provide sparse end-of-completion feedback, and can degrade as code length grows, making them ill-suited for real-time, prefix-level assessment during interactive coding and streaming generation. We propose SecCodePRM, a security-oriented process reward model that assigns a context-aware, step-level security score along a code trajectory. To train the model, we derive step-level supervision labels from static analyzers and expert annotations, allowing the model to attend more precisely to fine-grained regions associated with inter-procedural vulnerabilities. SecCodePRM has three applications: full-code vulnerability detection (VD), partial-code VD, and secure code generation (CG). For VD, SecCodePRM uses risk-sensitive aggregation that emphasizes high-risk steps; for CG, SecCodePRM supports inference-time scaling by ranking candidate continuations and favoring higher cumulative reward. This design yields dense, real-time feedback that scales to long-horizon generation. Empirically, SecCodePRM outperforms prior approaches in all three settings, while preserving code functional correctness, suggesting improved security without a safety-utility tradeoff."

To this end, we propose GeoGR, a geographic generative recommendation framework tailored for navigation-based LBS like AMAP, which perceives users' contextual state changes and enables intent-aware POI recommendation. GeoGR features a two-stage design: (i) a geo-aware SID tokenization pipeline that explicitly learns spatio-temporal collaborative semantic representations via geographically constrained co-visited POI pairs, contrastive learning, and iterative refinement; and (ii) a multi-stage LLM training strategy that aligns non-native SID tokens through multiple template-based continued pre-training(CPT) and enables autoregressive POI generation via supervised fine-tuning(SFT). Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate GeoGR's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.

We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7.5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0.18 and 0.66 over the top heads identified. This suggests that backdoor triggers do not form isolated circuits but instead co-opt the model's existing language components. These findings have implications for backdoor defense: detection methods may benefit from monitoring known functional components rather than searching for hidden circuits, and mitigation strategies could potentially leverage this entanglement between injected and natural behaviors."

We validate triboFoam using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a fully developed turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of $Re_τ= 180$. The results demonstrate good agreement with DNS data for particle concentration profiles and charge distributions. Then, we investigate the influence of Reynolds number on particle distribution and charging behaviour using Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) at varying friction Reynolds numbers up to $Re_τ= 550$. Our findings reveal that higher Reynolds numbers lead to increased near-wall particle concentrations and enhanced charging rates, attributed to intensified turbulent fluctuations and elevated impact velocities. Finally, an empirical correlation is proposed to predict the average particle charging rate as a function of Reynolds number and particle diameter. With this work, we provide a tool for simulating triboelectric charging in complex geometries and turbulent flows, advancing the understanding of electrostatic phenomena in particle-laden systems. The empirical correlation offers practical insights for predicting charging behaviour in industrial applications and thus can contribute to improved safety and efficiency in processes involving particulate matter."

It allows us to drastically simplify and strengthen existing impossibility results by proving that any near-linear-time shortcut-based algorithm cannot reduce a graph's diameter below $n^{1/4-o(1)}$. This greatly improves over the $n^{2/9-o(1)}$ lower bound of [HXX25] and seems to be the best bound one can hope for with current techniques. Our structural criterion also precisely captures the constructiveness of all known shortcut constructions: we show that existing constructions satisfy the criterion if and only if they have known efficient algorithms. We believe our new criterion and perspective of looking for certified shortcuts can provide crucial guidance for designing efficient shortcut constructions in the future."

However, there is still a shortage in studies targeting regression tasks, and more specifically applications on hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a spectral-spatial contrastive learning framework for regression tasks for hyperspectral data, in a model-agnostic design allowing to enhance backbones such as 3D convolutional and transformer-based networks. Moreover, we provide a collection of transformations relevant for augmenting hyperspectral data. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed framework and transformations significantly improve the performance of all studied backbone models."

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics."

    "abstract": "State-space language models such as Mamba and gated linear attention (GLA) offer efficient alternatives to transformers due to their linear complexity and parallel training, but often lack the expressivity and robust state-tracking needed for complex reasoning. We address these limitations by reframing sequence modelling through a probabilistic lens, using Bayesian filters as a core primitive. While classical filters such as Kalman filters provide principled state estimation and uncertainty tracking, they are typically viewed as inherently sequential. We show that reparameterising the Kalman filter in information form enables its updates to be computed via an associative scan, allowing efficient parallel training. Building on this insight, we introduce the Kalman Linear Attention (KLA) layer, a neural sequence-modelling primitive that performs time-parallel probabilistic inference while maintaining explicit belief-state uncertainty. KLA offers strictly more expressive nonlinear updates and gating than GLA variants while retaining their computational advantages. On language modelling tasks, KLA matches or outperforms modern SSMs and GLAs across representative discrete token-manipulation and state-tracking benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can mitigate the double-fading loss of passive reflection in satellite downlinks. However, their gains are limited by random co-channel interference, gain-dependent amplifier noise, and regulatory emission constraints. This paper develops a stochastic reliability framework for active RIS-assisted satellite downlinks by modeling the desired and interfering channels, receiver noise, and RIS amplifier noise as random variables. The resulting instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model explicitly captures folded cascaded amplifier noise and reveals a finite high-gain SINR ceiling. To guarantee a target outage level, we formulate a chance-constrained max-SINR design that jointly optimizes the binary RIS configuration and a common amplification gain. The chance constraint is handled using a sample-average approximation (SAA) with a violation budget. The resulting feasibility problem is solved as a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP) within a bisection search over the SINR threshold. Practical implementation is enforced by restricting the gain to an admissible range determined by small-signal stability and effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) limits. We also derive realization-wise SINR envelopes based on eigenvalue and l1-norm bounds, which provide interpretable performance limits and fast diagnostics. Monte Carlo results show that these envelopes tightly bound the simulated SINR, reproduce the predicted saturation behavior, and quantify performance degradation as interference increases. Overall, the paper provides a solver-ready, reliability-targeting design methodology whose achieved reliability is validated through out-of-sample Monte Carlo testing under realistic randomness and hardware constraints."

A historical and conceptual analysis of Einstein's use of Boltzmann's principle in those years reveals his evolving stance on its meaning and the role of probability, as well as his persistent doubts about the nature of radiation. We use our analysis to examine the limitations of extending the notion of Einstein's lightquanta across the electromagnetic spectrum: the relevant parameter is not the frequency, but the occupancy number."

To bridge the significant domain gap between ground and aerial data and address spatial sparsity, our framework learns general propagation priors from simulation, performs adversarial alignment of the feature spaces, and is fine-tuned on limited real UAV measurements.

Furthermore, we provide a unified hybrid-objective QSD framework that continuously interpolates between minimum-error discrimination (MED) and FitQSD, allowing flexible trade-offs among competing objectives. The associated optimization problems are formulated as convex programs and efficiently solved via disciplined convex programming or, in many cases, semidefinite programming. Additionally, a circuit synthesis framework based on a modified Naimark dilation and isometry synthesis enables hardware-efficient implementations with substantially reduced qubit and gate resources.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of large language model (LLM) deployments has made cost-efficient serving systems essential. Recent efforts to enhance system cost-efficiency adopt two main perspectives: (i) An algorithmic perspective that exploits heterogeneous model capabilities to route simpler queries to lower-cost models and complex queries to higher-cost models (i.e., heterogeneous query routing); and (ii) a systems perspective that utilizes heterogeneous GPU resources as cost-effective alternatives to homogeneous high-end GPUs (i.e., heterogeneous model deployment). However, algorithm-system co-design for cost-efficient LLM serving necessitates sophisticated management: (i) Determining optimal query routing strategies under latency and quality requirements, (ii) configuring model deployment across heterogeneous GPUs with appropriate resource allocation and parallelism strategies, and (iii) co-optimizing routing and deployment decisions to maximize overall system performance. To address these challenges, we present BOute, a quality-aware scheduling system that jointly exploits heterogeneous model and GPU capabilities for cost-efficient LLM serving. BOute employs a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to co-optimize the routing strategy and model deployment, thereby maximizing the cost-efficiency of the serving system while guaranteeing response quality. Evaluation results demonstrate that BOute outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving systems by up to 157% and 59% on average under identical cost budgets and quality requirements, or reducing serving costs by 15%-61% (38% on average) while maintaining the same performance targets, validating its effectiveness in achieving cost-efficient LLM serving."

The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction."

Specifically, we prove the existence of global strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data in the case $N=2$ when $γ\\ge 1$, and $N=3$ with $1 \\le γ< 8/3$ for the associated Cauchy problem. By employing techniques from Littlewood-Paley theory, range truncation analysis, refined Nash-Moser and De Giorgi iteration methods, we derive positive upper and lower bounds for the density. As a consequence, we are able to treat the whole-space case with strictly positive far-field density. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that establishes global strong solutions for physically relevant compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space, without imposing any symmetry or special geometric assumptions on the initial data."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems."

    "abstract": "Training stability remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

Another major difficulty with the projection method in this field is the lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees regarding its stability of the projection step.

We propose a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets, enabling locomotion via a thin, functional shell while preserving the entire interior cavity as a continuous volume for medical payloads. The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability.

This work proposes a validation method based on a standardized image-quality target according to ISO12233:2023 and ISO14524, together with a high-precision geometrical digital twin for direct comparison between real and simulated images taken of a driving scenario. The proposed approach is applied to the default camera sensor model in CARLA and targets the geometric and the radiometric parts separately. Thereby, this work proposes an enhanced model that fits the characteristics of the real camera used during experiments. Images generated with the proposed simulation model reduce the sim-to-real gap and are 112.73% better than the default model in terms of the Michelson-contrast. Evaluating the OECF-curves yields an 85.16% improvement. To demonstrate the applicability, we assess the performance of a deep neural network detecting a EuroNCAP pedestrian target at distances ranging from 5m to 100m. The results show that the default simulation model leads to overconfident predictions compared to the proposed model and the real camera.

    "abstract": "Aiming at the pitch angle control problem for aircraft longitudinal nonlinear models, particularly in the context of performance degradation or even control failure due to parameter perturbations and external disturbances, this paper adopts a backstepping control approach to design the system nonlinear model in a step-by-step manner. A neural network is introduced to approximate the system’s nonlinear dynamics online, enabling adaptive adjustment of the network weights when parameter perturbations or disturbances occur. A modification term is incorporated into the adaptation law to constrain the variation range of control parameters, thereby enhancing system stability. The proposed method effectively handles parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, achieves nonlinear adaptive control of the aircraft, and improves both the response speed and robustness of the system."

    "abstract": "In automated industrial grinding systems, real-time temperature monitoring is critical for product quality control. Addressing the challenge of temperature rise during grinding in cyclone mills compromising product quality, which leads to much material waste, while direct internal temperature measurement remains unfeasible, this paper proposes a temperature field inversion algorithm. By formulating an inverse heat transfer model, the Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm is employed to perform the inversion solution. The results demonstrate that the model achieves a deviation range of merely (–0.08, 0.06), effectively avoiding local optima and realizing high-precision temperature inversion. This approach provides a reliable method for temperature monitoring in an enclosed grinding chamber. Moreover, the inverted temperature serves as a feedback signal for Robotic Closed-Loop Control, enabling real-time adjustment of grinding parameters and improving automation reliability, reducing thermal-related downtime by 30% compared to standard PID control, meeting industrial production efficiency requirements."

The core innovation replaces complex Quotient Digit Selection (QDS) tables with a compact reciprocal lookup table generated via first-order series expansion (requiring only one DSP), while a precision compensation mechanism dynamically corrects approximation errors. We present a highly optimized FPGA implementation featuring a multiplexed pipelined architecture that maximizes resource reuse and supports configurable precision parameters. Experimental results on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs demonstrate significant improvements: 64% fewer LUTs vs. state-of-the-art designs [1], 76 % fewer DSPs vs. Xilinx Vivado IP, and superior latency-frequency tradeoffs (64-bit division in 21 cycles at 188 MHz). Functional verification confirms algorithmic correctness, establishing our solution as a resource-efficient, high-performance approach for fixed-point arithmetic in compute-intensive applications."

While conventional graph shift operators (GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to represent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this study proposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the extended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix via parametric design, enabling flexible adaptation to different graph structures and revealing more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we proposed a graph Fourier transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT) that adaptively tunes spectral properties to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based methods in anomaly detection, achieving superior performance across diverse network topologies."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to improve a model’s performance on an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from a source domain. Traditional UDA methods often overlook the rich textual information inherent in class labels, limiting their effectiveness. Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs), especially the contrastive language–image pretraining (CLIP) model, provide a promising multimodal foundation by integrating both image and text representations. However, most CLIP-based UDA approaches rely on pseudo-labels generated in a zero-shot manner by the pretrained CLIP model, which may become suboptimal as training progresses. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo-label refinement (PuRe) framework that begins training with zero-shot CLIP pseudo-labels and then transitions to self-training, where we iteratively refine the model’s own predictions as pseudo-labels. In this iterative process, we introduce label consistency learning to stabilize predictions under strong data augmentations, increasing robustness, and an information maximization (IM) loss to encourage high-confidence predictions while preserving prediction diversity. Together, these components progressively enhance pseudo-label reliability, leading to improved adaptation in the target domain. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning (PL) method that fine-tunes only a minimal set of parameters, specifically a single context token and class embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuRe surpasses existing UDA methods on multiple benchmarks."

    "abstract": "This study presents an empirical analysis of collaborative performance assessment in engineering learning scenarios. A validated instrument—derived from a previously developed questionnaire measuring seven operational dimensions of collaboration—was applied to evaluate group performance. The study involved 251 students from various engineering courses, organized into experimental groups based on personality traits and a control group formed according to student preference. Findings reveal that personality-based group formation influences collaborative performance, with outcomes varying by group configuration. Homogeneous and mixed groups emphasizing emotional stability (Neuroticism – N) demonstrated higher levels of leadership and collaboration, while heterogeneous groups underperformed compared to the control group. Across all formations, conflict management consistently emerged as the most challenging process, underscoring the importance of targeted strategies for managing interpersonal tensions in team-based learning. From a methodological standpoint, the assessment instrument exhibited high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α > 0.9), affirming its reliability for evaluating collaborative dynamics in academic contexts. The study concludes that personality-informed group formation can optimize specific collaborative processes, though its effectiveness depends on the combination of personality traits within each team. These findings hold significant implications for the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), particularly in informing the design of educational technologies that enable adaptive group formation and provide real-time feedback in collaborative learning environments."

In telecommunications, many core tasks—from signal processing to network optimization—require precise quantitative reasoning, where errors directly impact engineering practice. Existing benchmarks evaluate LLMs on general mathematics or telecom-related language tasks, but none assess llM capability to solve numerical mathematical problems in the telecom domain. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. TeleMath is built through a novel data generation methodology that starts from a compact seed of expert-crafted problems and expands it via problem decomposition, code- and symbolic math–driven blueprint generation, parameterized synthesis, and semantic validation. The resulting benchmark comprises 500 expert-verified question– answer pairs spanning diverse topics in the telecom domain with different levels of difficulty, each requiring a numerical solution. We then conduct a systematic benchmarking study of leading open-source LLMs, comparing reasoning-oriented models against general-purpose ones. On TeleMath, the best reasoning model, Qwen3-32B, achieves 69.51% pass@1 accuracy, substantially outperforming the best non-reasoning baseline, Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct, which achieves 39.99% average accuracy with 2× more parameters, underscoring the unique challenges of telecom mathematics.

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of cyber threats has exposed the limitations of traditional vulnerability assessment tools, which primarily rely on static scanning and CVSS-based scoring. These approaches often fail to capture dynamic configurations and evolving threat surfaces in enterprise environments. To address this gap, we present AegisGuard, a context-aware framework for automated vulnerability detection and adaptive risk stratification. AegisGuard integrates structured system telemetry, semantic threat intelligence through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a specialized large language model (LLM) to infer CVE applicability and assign five-level risk labels (L0–L4) that reflect both technical severity and environmental context. Unlike conventional scanners, AegisGuard dynamically adjusts its reasoning to system-specific privilege settings, exposure levels, and service criticality, enabling the identification of both critical exploits and subtle misconfigurations often missed by static tools. Our evaluation spans heterogeneous Linux and Windows platforms and leverages a dual-layer ground truth methodology: Core Ground Truth (C-GT) for verified vulnerabilities and Extended Ground Truth (E-GT) for semantically related threats. Results show that AegisGuard achieves an F1 score of up to 0.79 in CVE detection and exceeds 90% classification accuracy within a ±1 risk margin. Complementary ablation and prompt sensitivity analyses confirm the importance of RAG-based enrichment and structured input design in maximizing LLM effectiveness. Overall, these findings demonstrate that semantic, context-aware modeling is essential for accurate, scalable, and operationally relevant vulnerability management."

    "abstract": "Optical nonlinear media are the building blocks of nonlinear optics, which are commonly characterized by nonlinear polarizability. The inversion of polarizability for nonlinear media is an important problem in nonlinear optics. However, the maturity and accuracy of nonlinear media inversion methods lag behind those of ordinary linear media inversion methods because analytically and rigorously solving the Maxwell equations with nonlinear media is quite complicated. In order to derive inversion formulas, traditional nonlinear media inversion methods have to make various physical or mathematical approximations to the Maxwell equations. Essentially, the inversion of polarizability in nonlinear media belongs to the inverse scattering problem. Inspired by the advantages of numerical algorithms for solving the inverse scattering problem in linear media, we generalize the contrast source inversion method, which is one of the most popular methods for linear media, to second-order nonlinear media. The two-dimensional media distribution and undepleted-pump approximation are considered. Numerical tests conducted on either transverse magnetic or transverse electric data or joint data show that the generalized method can successfully reconstruct the nonlinear media distributions, and the joint inversion gives the best reconstruction quality in all test cases."

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. Recent advancements in OVSS have been driven by CLIP, a powerful vision-language model that enables segmentation through textual and visual feature matching. However, while visual features within a class exhibit significant diversity, their corresponding text features remain relatively limited in distribution. This discrepancy weakens the effectiveness of vision-language matching forOVSS. To address these challenges, we proposeOV-EVA(Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Enhanced Vision-Language Alignment), a novel training-free OVSS framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve visual-language alignment and enhance segmentation robustness. Our method introduces an iterative vocabulary expansion strategy, where MLLMs generate a diverse and scene-relevant vocabulary set through a two-stage querying process. To ensure accurate segmentation, we incorporate a mask-guided score refinement mechanism, which enhances vocabulary terms closely aligned with the target mask while mitigating overly dominant terms across the entire image. Additionally, we introduce a top-N-based target class mapping strategy to improve the alignment between the generated vocabulary set and target class labels. The proposed OV-EVA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks when using GPT-4o as the underlying MLLM. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong adaptability across different MLLMs, achieving competitive results with LLaVA and Janus-Pro. These findings suggest that leveraging generative reasoning from MLLMs offers a scalable pathway for robust zero-shot perception without task-specific training. Future work will focus on optimizing computational efficiency to facilitate real-time deployment in practical applications. We will soon release our source code."

Privacy is enforced through dynamic noise injection at both the feature and adapter levels, calibrated using gradient sensitivity. FedPerX is evaluated on two multilingual benchmarks—MARC and TSMD—spanning structured reviews and informal social media content across more than ten languages. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over seven state-of-the-art baselines, with up to +4.3% gains in macro-F1, a 70% reduction in communication overhead, and the lowest variance in client-level performance.

We incorporate Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and blockchain-based smart contracts to enhance security and efficiency while defending against AI-powered hardware attacks. PUFs provide unique device fingerprints resistant to AI-based cloning attacks, while smart contracts secure transactions and detect AI-generated fraudulent attempts.

In contrast, this brief considers the development of a novel adaptive STC policy that guarantees exact finite-time convergence of the FOSM subjected to a state-dependent uncertainty arising from the presence of a time-varying, asymmetric output constraint. This is achieved by first initiating a smooth invertible nonlinear transformation that explicitly accounts for the output constraint, which is followed by the design of a novel adaptive STC policy that guarantees exact finite-time convergence by explicitly accounting for the state-dependent structure of the perturbation term of the resulting unconstrained error system. Formation tracking experiments under visibility constraints, including performance comparisons with leading alternative designs, are used to verify the efficacy and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme."

As a Decision Support System, the DSS was designed to ingest real-time patient data, employing machine learning algorithms, and analytics to improve early identification of sepsis and support clinical decision making. A multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in three hospitals with 200 ICU nurses and 400 ICU patients. Participants were assigned either to the intervention group, using the AI system, or to the control group, who followed the standard sepsis detection protocol. Outcome measures were time to sepsis detection, response time by nurses, length of stay in the ICU, and 30-day mortality. Data collection was via electronic health records (EHRs), system logs, and hospital records. The use of the AI-driven decision support system yielded better clinical outcomes. The intervention group identified sepsis 3.4 hours' sooner (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{p}&lt;0.001$</tex>), had 5 fewer minutes in nurse response time (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{p}&lt;0.01$</tex>), had an ICU length of stay that was 1.8 days shorter (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{p}&lt;0.05$</tex>), and had an overall 30day mortality rate that was 9 % lower <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(p&lt;0.05)$</tex> compared to the control group. Nurses reported the system had a high usability rating and a System Usability Scale (SUS) score that averaged 86.5/100 and perceived the AI system was clinically relevant to the team (mean Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) perceived usefulness 4.4/5). This research confirms that an AI-enabled Decision Support System can lead to earlier sepsis detection, quicker response times, and improved patient outcomes in ICUs. Nurses reported that they found the system intuitive and beneficial, illustrating that AI can effectively enable nursing practice. Overall, this study demonstrated one approach to leverage AI within an ICU workflow with the potential to improve the quality of care provided to patients, as well as enhance the efficiency of sepsis management. Next steps in this area of research would include multi-site and multi-center trials, researching the longer-term impacts of the system and finding further improvements."

    "abstract": "Increased growth of e-commerce, ride-hailing, and delivery services has generated the need for dynamic pricing strategies that can adjust to actual time variables including demand, time, and location. This article proposes a dynamic pricing prediction model utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) combined within a simple-to-use Tkinter-based GUI. The system predicts past ride prices from attributes such as time, location, weather, traffic, and categorical attributes like city or type of car. ANN is capable of mapping non-linear complex relationships, and RNN considers temporal dependencies. Data preprocessing one-hot encodes and normalizes the data to prepare it for training, and the performance of the model is gauged by the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$</tex> score. Users can input ride data manually or via CSV uploads, switch between ANN and RNN models, and show predictions and SHAP-based feature importance for interpretability. Results show that ANN performs slightly better than RNN, though RNN is promising for more sequential data. The software is designed for real-world deployment in sectors like transport, logistics, and e-commerce. The modular nature allows for easy integration of future upgraded models or cloud APIs. Ultimately, the system covers deep learning and user interaction, promoting transparency, accessibility, and usability in real-world dynamic pricing prediction."

Unfortunately, recent research has demonstrated that fault injection (FI) attacks on SPHINCS+ can significantly compromise the security of the signing process. This paper introduces SHAFI, a countermeasure to FI attacks on SPHINCS+, that protects the signature generation and verification process via address masking. Experiments on a standard fault injection platform, ChipWhisperer, demonstrate that the proposed method renders faulty signatures unanalyzable by an attacker, eliminating the possibility of universal forgery attempts. This proposed technique is simple, memory and computation budget efficient, and applicable to virtually any SPHINCS+-derived hash-based signing technique.

These texts frequently contain a mixture of local languages, non-standard abbreviations, and brand-specific drug names, making them difficult to interpret accurately. The unstructured nature of these statements poses significant challenges for both healthcare professionals and automated systems, particularly when it comes to ensuring patient safety and facilitating effective clinical decision-making. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT3.5 have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text across a variety of domains. These models offer a promising approach to addressing the complexities of medical text by enabling automatic extraction and clarification of critical information. In this study, we leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT-3.5 to process and refine medication statements from discharge summaries. Our goal is to automatically identify key medical entities and expand these statements into more structured and interpretable formats. By doing so, we aim to enhance the readability and usability of medication information for both humans and machines, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare data management and patient care."

Specifically, for degree d and security parameter $\\lambda \\leq \\frac{\\log ^{2} d}{\\log \\log d}$, our IOPP has $2^{-\\lambda}$ round-byround soundness, $O(\\lambda)$ queries, $O(\\log \\log d)$ rounds and $O(d)$ length. This improves upon the FRI [Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh, Riabzev, ICALP 2018] and the STIR [Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, Yogev, Crypto 2024] IOPPs for Reed-Solomon codes, that have larger query and round complexity standing at $O(\\lambda \\log d)$ and $O(\\log d+\\lambda \\log \\log d)$ respectively. We use our IOPP to give an IOP for the NPcomplete language R1CS with the same parameters. Our construction is based on the line versus point test in the low-soundness regime. Compared to the axis parallel test (which is used in all prior works), the general affine lines test has improved soundness, which is the main source of our improved soundness. Using this test involves several complications, most significantly that projection to affine lines does not preserve individual degrees, and we show how to overcome these difficulties. En route, we extend some existing machinery to more general settings. Specifically, we give proximity generators for Reed-Muller codes, show a more systematic way of handling “side conditions” in IOP constructions, and generalize the compiling procedure of [Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, Yogev, Crypto 2024] to general codes."

    "abstract": "We study several problems in the intersection of cryptography and complexity theory based on the following highlevel thesis.1)Obfuscation can serve as a general-purpose worst-case to average-case reduction, reducing the existence of various forms of cryptography to corresponding worst-case assumptions.2)We can therefore hope to overcome barriers in cryptography and average-case complexity by (i) making worstcase hardness assumptions beyond $P \\neq N P$, and (ii) leveraging worst-case hardness reductions, either proved by traditional complexity-theoretic methods or facilitated further by cryptography.Concretely, our results include:•Optimal Hardness. Assuming sub-exponential indistinguishability obfuscation, we give fine-grained worst-case to average case reductions for circuit-SAT. In particular, if finding an NP-witness requires nearly brute-force time in the worst case, then the same is true for some efficiently sampleable distribution. In fact, we show that under these assumptions, there exist families of one-way functions with optimal time-probability security tradeoffs. Under an additional, stronger assumption - the optimal non-deterministic hardness of refuting circuit-SAT - we construct additional cryptographic primitives such as PRGs and public-key encryption that have such optimal timeadvantage security tradeoffs.•Direct Product Hardness. Again assuming iO and optimal non-deterministic hardness of SAT refutation, we show that the “(search) k-fold SAT problem” - the computational task of finding satisfying assignments to k circuit-SAT instances simultaneously - has (optimal) hardness roughly $\\left(T / 2^{n}\\right)^{k}$ for time T algorithms. In fact, we build “optimally secure one-way product functions” (Holmgren-Lombardi, FOCS ‘18), demonstrating that optimal direct product theorems hold for some choice of one-way function family.•Single-Input Correlation Intractability. Assuming either iO or LWE, we show a worst-case to average-case reduction for strong forms of single-input correlation intractability. That is, powerful forms of correlation-intractable hash functions exist provided that a collection of worst-case “correlationfinding” problems are hard.•Non-interactive Proof of Quantumness. Assuming subexponential iO and OWFs, we give a non-interactive proof of quantumness based on the worst-case hardness of the whitebox Simon problem. In particular, this proof of quantumness result does not explicitly assume quantum advantage for an average-case task.To help prove our first two results, we show along the way how to improve the Goldwasser-Sipser “set lower bound” protocol to have communication complexity quadratically smaller in the multiplicative approximation error $\\varepsilon$."

    "abstract": "While efficient randomized algorithms for factorization of polynomials given by algebraic circuits have been known for decades, obtaining an even slightly non-trivial deterministic algorithm for this problem has remained an open question of great interest. This is true even when the input algebraic circuit has additional structure, for instance, when it is a constant-depth circuit. Indeed, no efficient deterministic algorithms are known even for the seemingly easier problem of factoring sparse polynomials or even the problem of testing the irreducibility of sparse polynomials.In this work, we make progress on these questions: we design a deterministic algorithm that runs in subexponential time, and when given as input a constant-depth algebraic circuit C over the field of rational numbers, it outputs algebraic circuits (of potentially unbounded depth) for all the irreducible factors of C, together with their multiplicities. In particular, we give the first subexponential time deterministic algorithm for factoring sparse polynomials.For our proofs, we rely on a finer understanding of the structure of power series roots of constant-depth circuits and the analysis of the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator. In particular, we show that the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator constructed using low-degree hard polynomials (explicitly constructed in the work of Limaye, Srinivasan & Tavenas) preserves not only the non-zeroness of small constant-depth circuits (as shown by Chou, Kumar & Solomon), but also their irreducibility and the irreducibility of their factors."

Promising techniques for determining the accumulation of fish schools based on a photogrammetric approach are proposed. The paper describes in detail the features of visual identification of pre-spawning and spawning aggregations of these fish.

Furthermore, a Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing mechanism is designed to incentivize daytime charging and nighttime discharging of EVs, which automatically adjusts the operational modes of charging infrastructure. The proposed strategy effectively enhances the local consumption efficiency of PV generation while significantly mitigating the peak of the EH load, thereby achieving synergistic optimization of both source and load.

When a conflict is flagged, it is handled via weighted similarity analysis on voltage data and the LVDSA topology is updated according to the inferred cause.

These matrices are linearly interpolated to generate a continuous, depth-dependent transformation model. Each pixel's depth is retrieved from the ToF camera and used to evaluate a tailored homography, which maps coordinates between modalities. To handle missing or uncertain depth data, we apply percentile-based outlier removal and edge-aware interpolation. Final alignment is performed via bilinear resampling.

    "abstract": "Driver fatigue is a critical factor contributing to road accidents, particularly for long-haul and heavy vehicle drivers. Extended driving hours on highways can lead to reduced attention, slower reaction times, and microsleep, increasing accident risks. Traditional physiological monitoring methods such as EEG and ECG, while accurate, are expensive and intrusive. Vehicle-based systems like lane departure detection do not directly monitor the driver and are dependent on external conditions. Existing image-based solutions, though promising, often struggle in low-light conditions or require high-end hardware. This study proposes a real-time driver safety system that integrates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR), and Head Posture Analysis to detect drowsiness and fatigue more effectively. The system, implemented on a Raspberry Pi, utilizes a Pi Camera to monitor the driver's eye closure frequency, yawning patterns, and head movements. EAR analysis identifies prolonged eye closure, MAR detects excessive yawning, and head posture analysis determines if the driver's head tilts beyond a safe range, indicating drowsiness or inattentiveness. When fatigue signs exceed predefined thresholds, an alarm is triggered to alert the driver. The system leverages OpenCV, Dlib, and Python for efficient image processing and incorporates IoT functionality for remote monitoring, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution for enhancing road safety."

    "abstract": "The research employs EfficientNetB3 as a deep learning model to detect and classify blood cells as Basophil, Erythroblast, Monocyte, Myeloblast, and Seg_Neutrophil based on a pool of 5,000 high-resolution images. Preprocessing included resizing, normalization, and splitting of the data to enhance model performance. The model was trained for 30 epochs with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. The classification accuracy yielded a total accuracy of 95%, with precision, recall, and F1-scores of more than 0.92 for each class. The confusion matrix revealed minimal cases of misclassification, largely due to morphological similarity between certain types of cells. These outcomes validate that deep learning has the potential to enhance automated classification of blood cells and reduce reliance on human analysis. Future studies can explore ensemble models, large-scale data, and realtime integration in clinical practice to enhance classification accuracy and reliability in cancer diagnosis."

To empirically test the hypothesized effects, we draw on a survey data collected from 76 foresight practitioners. The findings show that SF has no direct impact on Innovation ambidexterity, while KM, DC and POS are mediating variables that jointly account for this relationship. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications along with future research directions are also discussed in this paper."

    "abstract": "The paper considers the problem of improving the quality of acoustic communication between a supply vessel and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) by ensuring their coordinated movement. An algorithm for controlling the movement of a vessel based on the model-predictive control (MPC) method is proposed. The algorithm generates the trajectory of the vessel, taking into account the predicted movement of the AUV, the dynamic limitations of the vessel and the parameters of the acoustic channel. Unlike approaches aimed only at minimizing the distance, the objective function of the algorithm directly maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This allows for comprehensive optimization of key parameters: transmission loss (TL), vessel noise level (NL), and antenna orientation. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm, comparative modeling of three strategies was carried out: the developed algorithm; movement behind the AUV; movement along the center of the tacks. The results of numerical modeling demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a higher and more stable quality of communication compared to traditional strategies, minimizing the risks of its interruption during AUV maneuvers."

However, this guarantee assumes the absence of disturbances. In this paper, we study the DBMC-based system under disturbances affecting the edge weights. We first establish rigorous error bounds on the resulting state estimates. Building on this analysis, we then propose a practical early termination strategy to prevent potential singularities, specifically, unbounded gain, that may arise in the presence of disturbances, while still ensuring that the shortest paths are correctly identified.

A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated to minimize operational cost while incorporating distributed generation (DG), demand response (DR), and prosumer participation. To improve practicality, a linearized MILP approximation is also implemented for benchmarking computational efficiency. Beyond deterministic optimization, extensive Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to capture uncertainties in upstream prices, DG output, and load demand. Reliability and resilience metrics, including Energy Not Supplied (ENS) and Loss of Load Probability (LOLP), are evaluated to quantify system robustness. Results on the IEEE 33-bus test system show that P2P trading reduces operating costs by 11–16% on average and improves reliability by nearly 45% compared to the baseline. Importantly, the proposed framework not only enhances economic efficiency but also contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing reliance on fossil-fuel-based upstream grids and increasing renewable utilization. These findings confirm practical value of combining EHs with P2P trading for future smart microgrids under uncertainty."

This paper introduces a hierarchical control architecture featuring a Large Language Model (LLM) based planner that autonomously synthesizes geometric safety constraints (exclusion zones) from abstract warnings and uses a \"semantic centroid\" method to translate nuanced motion modifiers into a continuous parameterization of a downstream Model Predictive Controller (MPC). The resulting plan guides a dynamic path planner that reconstructs its navigation graph on-demand to generate consistently safe trajectories for complex multi-robot tasks, including cooperative transport. We validated our framework in a high-fidelity simulator, demonstrating that the system successfully generates paths that maneuver around language-defined hazards, representing a significant step towards creating more intuitive, adaptable, and trustworthy robotic collaborators for human-centric environments."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses channel estimation error (CEE) mitigation in user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems under pilot contamination (PC). To suppress the PC, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the normalized CEE through the joint treatment of the pilot power allocation and the pilot assignment. However, the NP-hard nature of the problem makes finding a global optimal solution computationally infeasible. To tackle this challenge, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems: the fractional programming (FP) technique is employed for pilot power allocation, and a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) approach is applied for pilot assignment. The RL-based scheme, however, involves iterative action generation and reward computation, leading to significant overhead from repeated information exchanges. To mitigate this issue, we leverage a digital twin (DT) of the CF mMIMO system, utilizing its virtual environment and contextual awareness to optimize CEE reduction with minimal overhead. By employing closed-form expressions, the proposed schemes achieve computational efficiency without reliance on complex numerical solvers. Finally, we solve the original NP-hard problem via the block-coordinate descent and sequential optimization methods. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed FP-based pilot power allocation scheme improves the 95%-likely spectral efficiency (SE) by up to 15% and reduces the average pilot transmission power by up to 83% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, the pilot assignment scheme enhances the average SE performance by up to 7.4% over state-of-the-art pilot assignment approaches. These results validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in reducing CEE, leading to enhanced improvement in system performance in the presence of PC."

When quick scoring is prioritized, the system directly returns automatically scored results to answerers without requiring the scorers’ verification. When reliable scoring is required, the system shows the results to scorers for confirmation and correction before being disclosed to the answerers. The system comprises handwriting recognizers using deep neural networks and text-based scorers to determine whether an answer is correct, incorrect, or rejected. Question-specific scoring methods and rules (rubrics) (defined by the scorers) are used to score the answers consistently. To evaluate the system, handwritten answers in the three subjects were collected from at least 50 students for all grades of elementary and junior high schools. Scoring experiments showed that the average human scoring rate (percentage of answers rejected plus those falsely negatively scored and claimed) was under 30%, indicating that approximately 70% of the scorers’ workload could be reduced. The average risk scoring rate (ratio of false positives that may not be reported) was <2%, except for second-grade Japanese, which requires precise character writing. Finally, we conducted feasibility experiments on the entire system, including question distribution, answer capture, automatic scoring, score correction, and score return, with participants expressing satisfaction. This study lays the groundwork for a cycle of collecting handwritten answers and improving automatic scoring in educational contexts."

    "abstract": "Wheat is a staple crop in over 40 countries, with Asia accounting for more than 40% of global cultivation. Long-term mapping of wheat cover is critical for agricultural management and food security. However, existing wheat mapping products face a key limitation in spatiotemporal coverage: they either offer broad spatial coverage for a single or few years, or provide long time series that are confined to specific regions. To address this gap, we propose DeepMapping, a hybrid deep learning framework designed to generate a consistent annual fractional wheat cover product at 250 m resolution from 2001 to 2023 over Asia. Our framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models to extract complementary spatial and temporal features. It processes multi-resolution data, including 250 m and 500 m MODIS reflectance, alongside GLASS Leaf Area Index and Fractional Vegetation Cover products. The model is trained with fractions derived from the 10 m resolution WorldCereal 2021 map and refined with ancillary information such as coarse-resolution crop products, land cover data, and agricultural statistics to enhance reliability. By learning the relationship between short-term, high-resolution labels and long-term, coarse-resolution MODIS observations, DeepMapping is efficiently used to generates annual wheat fractional cover product over Asia at 250 m from 2001–2023.

We propose DeepMapping, a hybrid deep learning framework, to estimate long-term annual wheat fractional cover at 250 m from MODIS data. DeepMapping integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models to extract spatial and temporal features from MODIS data at 250 m and 500 m resolutions and Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) Leaf Area Index and Fractional Vegetation Coverage products.

In this work, we are the first to show that power wasters can still be created using only High-Level Synthesis (HLS), which is a standard development flow for cloud FPGAs. We demonstrate HLS-generated power wasters that can inject faults or crash the FPGA by applying overclocking and selected input patterns."

    "abstract": "Transaction fraud detection (TFD) remains a persistent challenge due to extreme class imbalance and the intricate temporal dynamics of user behavior. Conventional data augmentation techniques typically generate isolated samples, failing to preserve the sequential and temporal dependencies essential for modeling fraudulent transaction patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce BSCGAN, a Behavioral Sequence-aware Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, designed to synthesize realistic and temporally coherent fraudulent transaction sequences under specific class conditions. At the core of BSCGAN is a novel discriminator architecture based on Behavioral Sequence-aware LSTM (BSLSTM), which explicitly models inter-transaction time intervals and employs a dual-memory stream to disentangle long-term behavioral tendencies from short-term anomalies. This enriched temporal representation guides the generator to produce more plausible and context-aware sequences. By conditioning the generative process on class labels, BSCGAN facilitates targeted oversampling of fraudulent behaviors, thereby alleviating class imbalance during model training. Extensive experiments on realworld transaction datasets demonstrate that TFD models trained on BSCGAN-augmented data achieve significant improvements in F1-score and G-mean, validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Overall, this work offers an efficient solution for enhancing training data in TFD tasks by synthesizing behaviorally consistent and temporally structured fraudulent sequences."

This paper investigates sampling strategies as a means to mitigate this complexity. We evaluate the efficacy of performing hyperparameter tuning on a subset (25%) of training data using two distinct methods: uniform random sampling and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Our empirical analysis, conducted across eight UCI regression datasets, demonstrates that both sampling techniques yield substantial reductions in computation time, ranging from 22% to 82%, compared to a full grid search. LSH-based sampling shows consistent performance in estimating the hyperparameters of the algorithm. LSH’s effectiveness stems from its capacity to create a subsample that accurately preserves the data’s local geometry, a crucial feature for distance-based κ-η regression. These results establish LSH-based sampling as a highly efficient and reliable approach for enhancing the κ-η algorithm, providing an attractive trade-off between prediction quality and processing speed."

With the results obtained with the simulation of the LabVIEW software, in figure \"4\" it can be seen that the energy consumption of the submersible pump \"1\" is reduced by 33.4% and the energy consumption of the submersible pump \"2\" by 30%. In the same way, in figure \"5\" it shows us that there is a reduction in operating time in submersible pump \"1\" of 60 hours per month and in submersible pump \"2\" of 90 hours per month, all this is due to the fact that in figure \"6\" it shows us an increase in flow flow from 149 m3/h to 215m3/h in submersible pump \"1\", from 150m3h to 220m3h in the submersible pump \"2\". Concluding that by carrying out the design of the automatic closed-loop control of submersible pumps, there is greater reliability for the operation of the mining unit and performing real-time monitoring of electrical parameters remotely, thus increasing the useful life of the mechanical and electrical components."

Theoretical analysis shows that this topology can achieve constant current output under resonance conditions, and the output power is independent of the load. The simulation results show that during the movement of the receiving end, the output power fluctuation rate of the system is only 4.3%, which meets the design requirement of ± 5%, verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method."

The stripe patterns caused by this nonuniformity are sometimes subtle, leading to unavoidable blurring of scene details and structures when using existing image destriping methods to remove stripe noise. This paper proposes a deep network for stripe noise removal in infrared images, incorporating a multi-scale feature extraction mechanism to address the challenge of selectively removing strong and weak stripe patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches on publicly available datasets. It achieves better preservation of image textures and edge details while achieving the same level of stripe noise removal, thereby significantly enhancing image quality."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a variable capacitance adjustment approach based on direct current (DC) bias voltage control, aiming to achieve the regulation of the phase difference between voltage and current. This methodology employs Asymmetrical Voltage-Cancellation Control (AVC) to adjust the phase relationship of the system while simultaneously modulating its output power. Through Fourier analysis, AVC is decomposed into DC bias voltage and fundamental voltage components. The AVC is directly utilized at the inverter terminal to generate DC bias variations. By employing high-permittivity type-II ceramic capacitors, real-time alteration of capacitance values during system operation becomes feasible. Compared to conventional variable capacitance methods, this approach eliminates the need for additional devices, thereby mitigating power losses that may arise from extra power components. Simulation results demonstrate that this method can effectively adjust the phase difference in the system under conditions where coil parameter variations render the system distinctly capacitive, enabling it to operate in Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) mode."

The framework enables defenders to autonomously switch operational modes—from rescuers (rendezvousing with the target) to interceptors (intercepting the attacker), and vice versa. Using the Games of a Degree approach, we model the interaction within each mode as a linear-quadratic differential game and derive feedback Nash equilibrium strategies. We then adopt a receding horizon approach to enable mode switching and compute the agents’ switching strategies. The framework also accommodates scenarios in which the number of agents changes over the course of the game. We illustrate our results using agents modeled as differential-drive mobile robots."

At the same time, the safety of the AUV and the efficiency of its on-board equipment depend on the accuracy of the AUV movement in the vertical plane. The paper presents a method for synthesizing an adaptive system for generating a program signal for the pitch angle of AUV. This method allows you to form the desired value of the pitch angle to ensure such an angular velocity of the AUV along the pitch angle so that the thruster system can compensate for the negative torque of mutual influence between the AUV degrees of freedom. To do this, based on the equations of AUV motion in the vertical plane and the model of kinematics of the thruster system, the coefficient of conversion of the depth error into the desired pitch angle is calculated. This allows for precise control of the AUV depth during its movement at various speeds. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

The navigation system of this MSV should ensure not only high-quality of underwater work, but also ensure the safety of the crew. Therefore, it has increased requirements for accuracy and reliability. The core of the MSV's onboard navigation system is an inertial navigation system (INS) with an integrated doppler velocity log (DVL) and custom backup navigation algorithms which reserve coordinate estimation algorithms in case of INS fails. This paper presents the results of field trials of the navigation system conducted in Lake Ladoga at depths of up to 100 meters. The accuracy of both the INS and the backup navigation algorithms was evaluated in various configurations. The obtained navigation error was less than 0.2% of the distance traveled when the DVL was operating in bottom-tracking mode and less than 6.6% when the DVL was operating stably in water-mass layer mode. Emergency failures in the INS operation were identified. These failures, not described in the known literature or operation manuals of the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) units, confirmed the necessity of developing a backup navigation system."

These conventional approaches were prone to human errors, time-consuming processes, and the risk of proxy attendance, where one individual marks attendance on behalf of another. Additionally, biometric methods like fingerprint scanners, though more secure, faced hygiene concerns, especially during public health crises, and suffered from device wear and tear. This paper presents an intelligent and automated Face Recognition-Based Attendance System leveraging machine learning techniques and Euclidean distance matching for accurate identity verification. In this product the niche feature is QR code scanning. All the registered students will have their name called upon scanning the QR code, followed by their live face verification. Only after both IN and OUT verification the student attendance is recorded by the APP. The system is also developed using a combination of VB.NET, C\\#, Python, and MySQL for back-end integration, with XAMPP used for local server handling and database connectivity. This allows the flexibility to deploy the project as either a web application or mobile application. This, in turn, makes the product economical. Hence, it can be deployed in any sector of society. The integration of multiple platforms along with the machine learning model has led to the accuracy of 92 %. As the model is trained, the accuracy is expected to achieve 100 %. With the existing system having specifications of Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB RAM, and Windows 10 OS, the time required for attendance is 1.42 sec approx. This system aims to eliminate proxy attendance, reduce manual work, and enhance reliability in academic and professional environments."

Traditional finite element method (FEM) simulations, though accurate, are computationally prohibitive for large-scale interconnects in Very Large Scale Integration Circuit (VLSI) designs. To address this, we propose a novel two-stage Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for rapid and accurate prediction of coupled EM-TM-induced stress. The first stage uses a data-driven model to predict stress in individual wire segments, while the second stage employs a PINN to ensure atomic flux conservation and stress continuity at junctions of multisegment interconnects. By embedding governing partial differential equations into training, the framework learns the coupling between electrical, thermal, and mechanical phenomena. Experimental results on multisegment interconnects show excellent agreement with COMSOL simulations, with a mean relative error as low as 0.52 % and over 21.8x computational speedup, offering a scalable methodology for reliability analysis in advanced ICs."

The presented circuit architecture attains significant voltage amplification through the use of coupled inductors, ensuring effective energy transfer without relying on extremely high duty cycles or large winding ratios. Owing to reduced voltage stress across semiconductor devices and passive components, low-voltage MOSFETs with small RDS (on) can be employed, minimizing conduction losses and improving overall efficiency. Furthermore, the design alleviates diode reverse-recovery issues and recovers leakage inductance energy, thereby enhancing operational performance. The converter is supplied by a single DC input source, and its operating principle, mathematical formulation, and simulation parameters are discussed comprehensively. A performance comparison with other existing high-gain architectures highlights improvements in efficiency and voltage boosting capability. Simulation results demonstrating conversion from 20 V to 180 V in PSCAD/EMTDC, along with experimental verification using a 200 W prototype, confirm the accuracy of analytical predictions and validate the practicality of the proposed converter."

    "abstract": "Thermal infrared imaging has attracted widespread attention in many fields due to the advantages of all-weather imaging and strong penetration. However, existing methods for thermal infrared novel-view synthesis often produce results with coarse details and floating artifacts, primarily caused by physical factors such as atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction. These challenges hinder accurate reconstruction of intricate structures and temperature distributions in thermal scenes, limiting the practical utility of previous approaches. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a physics-induced 3D Gaussian splatting method named Thermal3D-GS, the first novel-view synthesis method that relies exclusively on thermal infrared image. Thermal3D-GS begins by modeling atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction in three-dimensional media using neural networks. Additionally, considering the sparse features of infrared images, sparse feature priors are designed to improve the reconstruction accuracy of thermal infrared images. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our method, the first large-scale benchmark dataset named Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis Dataset (TI-NSD) is created. This dataset comprises 50 authentic thermal infrared video scenes, covering indoor, outdoor, traffic and UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) scenarios, with a total of 15,213 frames of thermal infrared image data. In addition, an expanded validation thermal infrared dataset, which includes three high-resolution scenes and five special scenes under varying atmospheric conditions and complex propagation media is constructed to assess generalization performance of the proposed method. Based on this dataset, this paper experimentally verifies the effectiveness of Thermal3D-GS. The results indicate that our method outperforms the baseline method with a 3.19 dB improvement in PSNR and significantly addresses the issues of floaters and indistinct edge features present in the baseline method.

This has been done for planar holonomic systems like marine vehicles, which provides a motivating source for applying similar approaches to control omnidirectional mobile robots given their holonomic kinematics. A sliding mode controller is developed based on an optimal choice of the sliding coefficient using full-order lyapunov matrices. The control design parameters ensure decay of uncertain terms, while ensuring that the error trajectories reach the sliding manifold quickly and maintain smoothness when entering the manifold. The robustness of the closed-loop system is proved via Lyapunov theory. Numerical results support the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "In the present study, the output voltage of a DC-DC boost converter is tuned to a desired value by implementing a PI controller with two loops. To achieve this, the output voltage of the converter together with the inductor current must be available for the controller. Since direct measurement of these variables may not always be possible, an improved intelligent observer based on the PI-type extremum seeking control method is applied. This is to provide the estimation values of the inductor current and the input voltage of the converter. The observer operates online, requires minimum system information, and can reliably estimate these variables using only the measured output voltage. The estimated values are then provided into a double-loop controller which keeps the value of the output voltage at the pre-set value in the presence of input voltage variations. Furthermore, a comparison is made between the results achieved by the applied observer and those achieved by classic extended state observer and a sliding mode observer to demonstrate its superior estimation accuracy and robustness. The simulations are done in MATLAB™ and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method during accurately estimating system states under gradual input voltage changes."

To validate its performance, the MPC controller was benchmarked against a conventional hysteresis controller. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 13.68% reduction in energy consumption while successfully maintaining the thermal comfort index within the desired range. This is achieved through its high adaptability to dynamic environmental changes, highlighting the potential of predictive control for enhancing energy efficiency and sustainability in modern buildings."

The evolution of IoT and microcontrollers has opened promising avenues for developing sustainable solutions to societal problems, such as food waste. The development and implementation of smart IoT devices, such as the Smart IoT Fruits and Vegetables Dehydrator System, allow users to prolong the shelf life of their produce through dehydration. To assess the performance of the Dehydrator System, a pliability test was used to evaluate the quality of dehydrated fruits and vegetables. Descriptive statistics were employed to interpret the data, and hypothesis testing was conducted to determine whether the calculated critical value rejects or fails to reject the null hypothesis. With a sample size (n) of 50, a significance level of 0.05, and a one-tailed hypothesis, it was found that most of the passed samples had a critical value of 1.645, which is significantly higher than the null hypothesis value of 0.5. Therefore, the number of passed samples is greater than the failed samples, validating the heating capability of the dehydrator and its ability to produce high-quality dehydrated produce."

    "abstract": "Today, concerns about the significant increase in energy demand, as well as global warming caused by fossil fuels, highlight the role of hydrogen in realizing future sustainable energy systems. In this context, integrating the capabilities of hydrogen with the energy hub (EH), as an efficient framework for optimal operation of multi-carrier infrastructures, can pave the way toward sustainability and energy efficiency. Accordingly, this paper employs a hydrogen-integrated energy hub (HIEH) framework, which combines the advantages of EHs in achieving energy efficiency with hydrogen's unique ability to store electrical energy, leading to synergies in efficiency, as well as improved redundancy and reliability. This research proposes a reliability-oriented framework that aims at optimal scheduling and efficient energy management for interconnected HIEHs. Numerical result from the simulation of the proposed model within the IEEE 33-bus test system in the distribution level, including 33 HIEHs, denote the efficiency of the proposed model. Key findings from the simulations of the proposed framework demonstrate significant improvements in reliability, renewable energy curtailment, operational costs, and exported energy to the upstream grid."

    "abstract": "This study presents and experimentally validates an adaptive control method for human-exoskeleton interaction through online adaptation of desired joint trajectories. Leveraging gait phase and human-exoskeleton interaction torque estimators, our approach enables seamless assistance adaptation to varying walking patterns and speeds. Specifically, a pre-trained neural network approximates the exoskeleton's dynamics, enabling real-time interaction torque estimation from kinematic measurements and commanded motor torques alone. These estimates drive a gradient-descent update of the joint reference trajectories, minimizing a cost function that penalizes both interaction torques and trajectory modification, ensuring bounded convergence and stability without user-specific parameter tuning. We compared our adaptive controller with a fixed-trajectory gait-phase-based controller during overground and treadmill walking at three self-selected speeds ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 m/s. In 16 participants, the adaptive controller significantly reduced the hip and knee interaction torques by 51.2%<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula>11.1 and 63.9%<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula>29.7, respectively, during overground walking.

Post-adaptation trajectories more closely resembled those of walking without the exoskeleton, and exoskeleton-torques aligned more closely with human biological torques.

    "abstract": "Data-driven soft sensors have been widely applied to estimating important yet difficult-to-measure quality-relevant variables in industrial processes. The complex industrial data exhibits nonlinearity and dynamics due to changes in operating conditions. Soft sensors developed based on the assumption of identical and independent distributions often struggle to adapt to target domain data with significant distribution discrepancy, which poses a great challenge to traditional soft sensor approaches. Additionally, the dynamic features embedded in the practical industrial processes are of great importance for an accurate soft sensor. Existing soft sensor approaches pay little attention to the combined challenge of distribution discrepancy and dynamic feature transfer, referred to as the dynamic domain adaptation challenge. In this work, we propose a Self-modified Dynamic Domain Adaptation (SDDA) soft sensor approach to solve this problem. We develop a novel sequential optimization framework for dynamic domain adaptation, where the target samples are progressively incorporated and pseudo-labels are iteratively refined to preserve the underlying temporal dependency and enable efficient dynamic feature transfer. Also, we propose a feature alignment with the transfer component analysis (TCA) to avoid potential significant distribution discrepancy and guarantee a stable prediction. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method via two real-world industrial cases."

To address this, we propose a novel multimodal spatial-frequency fusion and refinement network (MSFFRN). The framework is designed to holistically capture and fuse multimodal features. It employs a dual-branch architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition with CNN-based spatial encoding for complementary feature extraction. Furthermore, a hierarchical fusion strategy using adaptive gating and cross-attention mechanisms dynamically integrates cross-modality and cross-domain information, while a dedicated feature refinement module enhances robustness against environmental distortions and preserves structural feature. Extensive experiments on the Houston 2013 and MUUFL datasets demonstrate that MSFFRN achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing the overall accuracy (OA) by 2.66% and 1.32% on the respective datasets."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an 8×8 dual circularly polarized (DCP) phased array antenna and an associated analysis framework for achieving high polarization purity during wide-angle, multi-azimuth-plane circularly polarized (CP) beam scanning. First, polarization-incorporated array factors are formulated for 2×2 sequential-rotation (SR) subarrays and extended to large arrays, enabling explicit prediction of the right-handed and left-handed CP radiation patterns. The analysis shows that SR yields ideally pure circular polarization in the main beam direction under the simplifying assumption that, for a fixed elevation angle, the phase of the element RHCP component is invariant with respect to the azimuth angle φ (and analogously for the LHCP component) but inevitably generates cross-polarized (Cross-pol.) lobes in off-boresight directions, whose angular locations depend on the beam steering angle and inter-element spacing, whereas their peak magnitude is fundamentally bounded by the axial ratio (AR) of the array elements. Guided by this analysis, a compact self-phase-shifting DCP element operating at 5.7–5.9 GHz is developed, exhibiting port isolation exceeding 15 dB. An 8×8 DCP phased array composed of 2×2 SR minimum periodic subarrays is then designed, fabricated, and measured. Simulation results show that, during ±60° beam scanning in the φ = 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° planes, the active VSWR remains below 2.0 within ±45° and below 3.0 within ±60°, while the AR in the main-beam direction is kept below 1.18 dB and Cross-pol. levels in the entire upper hemisphere are at least 15 dB lower than the peak co-polarized gain. Measurements confirm a slight (0.05 GHz) upward shift of the operating band and validate the predicted wide-angle, high-polarization-purity DCP performance."
